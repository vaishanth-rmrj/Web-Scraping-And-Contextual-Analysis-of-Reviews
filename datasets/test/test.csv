Mahmood Wahid,4.0,2022 12 September,"
First Impression:Whoa... will this work it's Tiny!and it will because- It's a 1/2 HP DC motor which is equivalent to a 1 HP AC motor and powerful enough for it to pull my gate.- Gate Weight limit when I purchased was listed as 1400 lb currently it mentions 1100 lb, mine falls at or below 1400 lb or so.What is included and what is not:It includes mounting hardware, screws brackets, and mounting steel frame. A fair amount of chain. Some not-so-good tools. We got 2 key chain Remote openers in the boxWhat you may need to get:Safety Sensor: It did not include the safety sensor when I bought it so I bought that. Like your garage door if something is in the path it will stop closing and open back up. Do not, repeat Do Not power the gate up without this sensor, Period. Unless you want things getting crushed, you get the idea.Safety sensor wiring and technical writing in the manual did not make sense I ended up calling the tech support line of the safety sensor and got the correct instruction on wiring.Chain:I also had to get some extra chains, my gate's length is a little less than 34~36 feet.Chain mending tool: Get one to make it easier for yourself.Mounting Bolts that go in the concrete Block:Take the Mounting Bracket with you and get these 4 Concrete Anchor Bolts from box stores in the hardware section.Yes, please use Re-Bars in that concrete block. You'll notice my assembly is a little bit different where it's higher than usual assembly since I've a retaining wall in that area that became my mounting block instead.**Important Note:Before pouring concrete tie those anchor bolts and do this step that will save some elbow grease later. While pouring the concrete use the mounting bracket with those bolts so that those bolts don't move away and later on don't line up with the mounting brackets.I did not do this and later on, I had to spend a good amount of time to get the steel mounting bracket on those bolts. Now that I think of it could I've eliminated that steel mounting bracket, I wonder. So if anyone has done it without that please post your comment.Keypad Opener:We bought 2 one inside the gate and another one outside the gate. Also, we got extra keychain opener to put one in each car. Remember to program all of these with the opener’s circuit board, you’ll find the instruction in the manual.Power to the mounting Block, wire, conduit, and breaker:I ran metal conduit/pipe to the mounting area into the ground and used direct bury cable in the ground then up again in the metal pipe into my garage wall then attic, and down into the breaker box with a dedicated 15 Amp breaker. I installed a box at the mounting area to include a GFCI outlet for later. If you’re not savvy with this type of work please hire an electrician for this work.Tools: If you have a rachet set and screwdrivers that will do with what’s supplied in the box.Installation:Mounting the motor assembly was okay. Then we actually welded the end brackets that will hold the chain. I think that would be sturdier than mounting that with bolts. When came time to install the magnet sensors that’s where we spent a lot of time figuring out the height and how close it needs to be to the motor. You will need another person for sure with this part.Maintenance:Check the nuts and bolts say each quarter. I installed this in January 2020 and this Labor Day (2022) the Magnet signal receiving block or the function in the motor unit stopped working. While checking on that I found out 2 nuts totally came off and some needed tightening.Since the magnet stop function was not working my gate got derailed. I put it back and while trying to figure out what was wrong it derailed again. Let’s just say it’s a bit of work to put it back on the rail.So here is another important tip I’ll add as a note below.Important Note:While building the rail for the gate, add 2 to 3 feet of extra at the opening side. In case the motor malfunctions and goes out more than it’s supposed to it won’t get derailed and the chain will stop it. If you have it to the mark and if it goes that extra foot and a half it will surely derail. So please put the extra couple of feet of rail to save agony later on.After Sale Service: In my humble opinion, this is what matters for a good product and the company stands behind it.Customer/Technical Support:February 2020:During installation, a simple electrical connector went bad and I was made to get a replacement unit then customer service finally responded and sent me that connector, and I sent the new-new unit back.September 2022:This time it is out of its 1 year warranty period and the magnet unit is not responding where the gate does not stop. I’ve sent an E-mail via Amazon and no response; I just sent another E-mail directly to its support E-mail and waiting to see what kind of support or direction I get.

This unit has great ratings so I'll just skip all the perks and say yes, for the money it seems to be a good deal. In fact, I'm not sure you can beat it. In fact, the cost for what you get is why I'll still give it 4 stars despite the fact that trying to make it work right is only slightly more challenging than defusing a bomb, in the dark, with nail clippers, while passing a kidney stone.The sad thing is that it's not the unit so much as the ridiculously deplorable excuse for instructions.  Now don't get me wrong.  I'm fine with crappy instructions that just don't explain things.  I'm very good with tools, relays, circuitry, and engineering.  The issue here is that the instructions aren't just bad, they're WRONG.  They send you down bad roads.  If they were written correctly, this would be a 5-Star machine.If you look around you will find many people have complained about this, and offered different workarounds.  I'll do my best to lay out what I did in hopes of helping someone else.First, there are several Youtube videos out there.  The Heritage Farms channel has a few videos on this.  Their original review and video on installing the Seco-Larm Enforcer electric eye are ones I would highly recommend.  The Enforcer electric eye I mention as many reviewers seem to use that, but holy cow, that's another one with instructions that are as wrong as these.My unit is a Right Hand installation as depicted in the instructions.  What I mean is that if you're inside the fence, looking at the gate, my opener is on the right hand side of the driveway, just like the one in the Heritage Farms video.  In this configuration, you are supposed to set the board to ""FWD.""  If it was on the other side, you would set the board to ""REV.""Once it was all installed and working, I hooked up the Enforcer electric eye, and what would happen is that if the beam was broken while the gate was closing, it was ignored, and if the beam was broken when the gate was opening, it reversed and started closing.  So exactly the opposite of what it's supposed to do.  By the same token, if you set the gate to auto close after so many seconds, what would happen is that when it opened, it would stay there all day, but if you closed it, then it would open after that many seconds.  So clearly, the gate thought it was open when closed, and closed when open.  At this point simply changing the switch from FWD to REV will not fix the issue.I believe in the Heritage Farms video he had the same problem, as he said he believed they had wired a circuit backwards in the system, and I concur.  I rewired it.  He fixed his by reversing the way the chain feeds through the sprockets, and I think he may have had to change his magnets.  I didn't do that for two reasons.  The first is that someone here posted a question as to how the chain was supposed to feed, and Banyan Imports stated that it is indeed supposed to feed like in the manual.  To be fair, based on my one communication with them, I'm not sure they have the slightest idea what's correct, but the other reason I didn't change it was because when I started to do it I realized I was going to have to re-cut the chain as it changed the length needed.So here is how I fixed mine.  I can't say if it will work for anyone else, or if what I did is the right thing to do.  It's just how I fixed mine to work like it says it's supposed to work in the manual.  No warranties express or implied, your mileage may vary, and all that fun stuff:First, I found that backwardly wired circuit which if you look at your schematic is at the X7 terminals.  The schematic shows wires marked OPLM and CLLM.  I frogged those two wires on the block (reversed their position).  Doing this kept me from having to change the positioning of the two magnets that were already mounted to the gate.  I was done welding, painting, etc., and just didn't want to have to move them.  Then I changed the switch configuration on the board from FWD to REV (which is dead WRONG per the directions).  Then, viola.  It works fine.Now for that Seco-Larm Enforcer beam.  I'll post this in my review there, but if you use one of these things it's not straight forward either.  I usually like Seco-Larm products, but this is a terrible schematic.  The CO-Z clearly uses DC current to power the beam, and you can confirm this with a Fluke meter, but you have to use the AC wire.  Here is the configuration to make it work on the CO-Z (or at least what worked for me):Power Slot = Brown WireGnd Slot = Both Blue & White WireIR Slot = Grey WireBlack Wire is UnusedI would still recommend the unit, but I would have been better off had there been no directions at all.One suggestion.  When you're setting it up and testing before you mount anything, turn on auto-close.  Then you can see what the unit thinks is opened, closed, etc. as you play with the magnets.  That could keep you from dealing with some of these headaches.Good luck.

Not a compensated comment. Overall you can't beat the quality of this product so far, it is hard to say how long the motor will last, but hopefully you can get replacement parts and that would be a plus! Very clean installation and with some modifications it has met my expectations. First of all it comes with basically everything you will need to get it going. The anchors would be a nice addition, I used 3/8 in and is very solid, make sure you start with a good foundation. On my install I timed it with the concrete pour for the gate so is one big slab of concrete and it is solid. My electrical box is on the opposite side of the driveway so I used the gate track and ran the thermostat cable under it, perfect for my needs. The gate was built at exactly 20 ft so no chain modification was required. Since the gate has a lot of metal at the bottom I had to extend the antenna, now it goes all the way up the pole and I can operate the gate at a much farther distance. Looking into adding WIFI module any recommendations would be appreciated. The bolts were a little too long for my gate and should be design with security in mind, maybe allen type or tork head,  but nothing a cutting disk can't manage and in my case they are not exposed to the outside where they can be tampered with. The chain tension brackets could use an up and down side to side adjustment sort of like a cross type to be able to offer better adjustment capability to the chain. In my case they worked out just fine. The L bracket could be shorter where the chain bolts down to, just in case the gate pole is too close and hits it, in my case it was perfect and barely miss the poles. The instructions could be better, seems like this is a big issue with some owners. The remotes. I don't like to be looking for a remote while I'm driving to open a gate. I went ahead an installed a visor clip, most will do just make sure the screws you use are not too long that can damage the electronics inside the remote. The wireless keypad works great and should be part of the opener's package, maybe a compatible sensor also. I tried installing a sensor but had no luck, (wired according to 2 videos I watched on U2B) but instead of retracting or stopping the gate when the beam was broken (could hear the relay and the light change from yellow to red) the gate just kept going so I removed it and return it, I will try  again since I believe the problem was with the sensor. I would recommend this product at this time. I'm hoping to get many years of trouble free performance, only time will tell. Last but not least, don't forget to lube the chain every so often. Update July 14, 2021,  since there is a sidewalk by the gate I installed a strobe light, comes on and off when the gate closes or opens, great visual indications the gate is moving. Will try a WIFI smart switch shortly to see if I can voice open and close. Just need to find a compatible remote for the WIFI switch to simulate the button press to open and close and install a wired magnetic sensor for status checks, or figure out which terminals to hook up the switch to the board if possible, but there is not much information out there for this and the schematic in the manual that came with the opener is not for the model I actually got. Basically the same thing I did for the garage opener and it works like a charm. I like the idea of Alexa opening or closing the gate as I depart or arrive to the house. This would complete this project! UPDATE, 16th July 2021, finally got the voice open/close going, works like a charm with status command. I have to say I'm impressed with this opener. I can open the Alexa app coming back to the house and open the front gate using voice commands with security passcode, the gate is 20 ft long so it takes a while for it to open, I wish the opener had 2 speeds a slow/fast but it doesn't so this way I can have it open by the time I arrive at the house and don't have to stop traffic waiting on it to open. I can also open the garage door the same way. UPDATE: October 2021, Customer support has been excellent! The seller got your back!

KARLA,4.0,2022 1 October,"
So there is a lot of unmentioned tools needed for this job that should make it less of a hassle so far that I know of… starting off you need a power supply cord and people just recommend cutting one end of an extension cord you already own you need a chain breaking tool so it’s wait to get the right length you’ll also need needle nose pliers a very good drill extra materials to make your fence longer if needed I had to weld 2 longer bars as machine needs to be 11 inches away from end of the gate you also need zip ties for the magnets and luck figuring out the instructions… most people have have bought there own base bolts because the kit comes with weird L shaped ones I will be using what it came with and post pics after words

Michelle Smith,5.0,2022 16 October,"
It was perfect. Just what we were looking for. No more getting out of the car rain, snow, sleet or shine to open the gate. We even made our own gate that my husband installed and we are fixed. I would recommend this product. Thanks COZ

RR,5.0,2022 1 August,"
We had a new fence installed and wanted a sliding gate across our carport. Had the fence company install the new fence and the built the gate. The rest was up to myself or a operator installer. The installer quoted me over $4,000.00. I added a post with guide rollers. Ran electric to the site. and the rest was pretty simple. The magnets were a bit difficult to locate in the exact spot, but otherwise all is good. Operates as it should.I only wish CO-Z made a remote on a visor clip. Having to dig around for a key chain every time is a non starter and I see no other option they sell. I bought a couple of generic visor clips and drilled holes through the back of the keychain remotes so we could have them on the visor. This worked for us.The remotes have 4 buttons. The buttons do not have any other function other than ""Operate"" You have to program each of the 4 buttons and they all do exactly the same thing. I suppose this is great for those of us who have to operate more than 1 gate. But I see no real world reason to have more than 1 button.Still a good buy and would buy again.

David,5.0,2021 11 January,"
I've had a side-yard access gate at my house for approximately 7 years.  This is my 3rd gate opener and it should have been my first.  I went through two different iterations of rack-and-pinion, low-voltage gate openers from Gate Crafters at the cost of $600 each, and neither one ever worked right.  The first one had horrible range and would over-run the limit if it got misaligned.  The second one wasn't much better, but the range was approved.  The problem with those systems is that it would count revolutions of the motor and count them back down when closing - if the rack skips on the pinion at all while opening, it will try to close past the stop point, and the motor wasn't smart enough to stop - it eventually would have burned up.  So the gate always needed to be supervised.  What's the point then?  Might as well manually open it.Sure, I had to wire 110v for this one, but its worth it!  The chain drive is far superior to rack and pinion as it is much less susceptible [impossible?] to skipping.  I had to adjust the rack every season to account for temperature changes - that problem appears to go away with this one.  This motor is powerful - much more so than the low-voltage one previously; if the rack and pinion were too tight it would just stop moving the gate (extremely frustrating).  Again, what's the point of a gate opener then?Installation?  I'm a pretty experienced DIYer and figured this out in spite of the quite unclear instructions.  Now that I have it installed I see there are many YouTube videos to assist.  Just make sure you have something to shorten a chain - I ended up having to cut it off and clean up the end link with a Dremel.  Use 1/2"" concrete anchors and shim to level if you need to.Oddly, I set the reverse switch as it suggested, but that was unnecessary.  I haven't setup auto-close on it, nor the IR sensor (on order) - so I'll have to work through that if my open/close is backwards.  Instructions sure could have been clearer on this.Installation time?  A couple trips to the hardware store (electrical and concrete anchors).  About 2 hours to get the 100v run to it.  About 2 hours to test the motor to see how it works with the limit magnets and determine exactly where the motor will be placed as well as the limit magnets (I highly recommend taking your time here to make sure you fully understand before you mount it).  About another 3 hours to get it fully mounted, chain installed and tested.  Finally, I spent 2 hours playing with it in amazement that it it actually worked correctly unlike the much more expensive previous models.Wow, 5-stars because of price, performance and quality.  1-star for instructions.

Scootr,4.0,2020 25 February,"
We electrified our existing gate.We did a fair amount of research and decided on the C)-Z opener for the following reasons.1. Price2. was amazon support and warranty3. The reviews were pretty good4. Auto close feature sounds good... hope I can find out how to activate this5. It works with a infrared safety switch ( extra) so it on't close on your car, your dog, etc6. It can work with a key pad for delivery or emergency service entrance7. speaking of emergency there is a simple keyed manual operation for times when the power is out or whatever.8. It can operate a courtesy light.9. It said it would operate a 1400 pound gate 40 ft long.Honestly who has a gate like that? Fort Knox ?We have an 350 pound gate rolling across our asphalt drive with a two wheel trolley out front and 3 rollers on 3 pipes bolted to the fence. Pretty standard. We changed the front wheels from 6 to 8"". One wheel is a hard acrylic  and other is steel wheel with a V groove. Matching V groved track was secured to the drive. This guides the gate.Make sure your gate rolls straight and easy. Fix any imbalance or tracking issues before installing the opener.We poured 16x18x18 pier to support the opener. We ran house current out to the pier and embedded the J bolts afixed to the support stand into the we cement. Installation was pretty easy to follow except we lost a page of instruction for awhile - we had the open and closed magnet positions reversed. FYI the high position magnet is the open limit and the lower position one is the close limit. To learn the magnet position disengage the drive chain gear. move the gate to the desired open or closed position and pass the magnet behind the running opener until it stops. Do this repeatedly until you know where the magnet needs to to be mounted.Be sure to start with a magnet position so the gate will stop a little short and then sneak up on the final adjustment. If you do screw up unbolt the chain to release. At this time we realized having a power off switch is very helpful as the gate will NOT STOP TRYING TO CLOSE if it hits something. always keep the remote in hand when first testing in case you need to stop. Begin testing with the gate in the middle position for safety.Now 9 months later. We love our automated gate. We operate it 6 - 12 times a day. Likely you will have to do maintenance or make adjustments from time to time.  Our gate wheels and track require maintenance. and we do spray grease  on the chain and moving parts. Today I had to move a magnet closer to the control box so the control would detect the magnet reliably. Not sure why that changed but I also stuck an additional little rare earth magnet on the original magnet to boost it's strength. So be prepared to maintain the operation.That's it - we love it after pulling this gate shut for 20 years... The remote works from 3-400 ft away. I bought more remotes so we can have them in all the cars, golf carts, and tractors.Do it - you will be glad you did. Oh yeah the DC feature requires 24v - that might work some of you.

hard to mount magnets on a chain link fence when the fence post does not align up. other than that works great.

I was iffy on purchasing this gate opener, there are way more expensive brands and I did not have faith in this. BUUUUUUUT let me tell you people, this thing rocks. I installed it 2 yrs ago and it's still kicking.If you have a some electrical knowledge and a hint of welding (welding not required) skills you can make this work.Took me about 5 hrs to install and have running. You will need to pour a concrete pad 18 inches square and deep (ideally you want 400 lbs, 4 95 lbs bags of quickrete). There are plenty of videos on YouTube as to how to install. I had to install a bar at the end of my gate, I would loose allot if my driveway if I didn't. All in all I recommend this gate opener.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 17 April,"
Great little gate opener. After looking for many electric gate opener, we decided to give this one a try considering the price.Installation was fairly easy, except  two things 1) Setting up the magnetic sensor2) Trying to Hook up the wire into the unit (It's a tight spot so had to be careful. Wish there was more space).Chain link rolling gate:400lb (24 feet wide and 6 feet high).Wire used:12/3 outdoor wireChain:The chain that comes with the package is 20 feet( two chains of 10 feet each).  Bought an additional #41 chainPower consumption:To test how much power the motor draws, connected the power source to a 20 amp smart plug and 20 amp GFCI outlet.Here's the reading's ( Not sure these readings are accurate though). Watts:228, mA 1898, Ac voltage 122.3.Overall cost was approx $500🙂 to setup and get the gate working. It's only been a month so time will only tell how durable the product is.

Eva Garcia,5.0,2020 7 July,"
This machine is powerful and works great. I had to pay someone to install because I am not that handy. If you are handy, then you will save money on installation. It is powerful, see videos relating to this product that is exactly what you are going to get. It is expensive to pay someone to install in Dallas. Most people were charging around $300, and I think that was on the cheap side with handy mean and not a company. I found a neighbors friend that only charged me $100. I still have to get an electrician out to drive an electric cable under the ground, for now I've been using an extension cord. This will probably cost me around $50. You have to take these cost into account when purchasing the product. You have to be careful with this machine it is powerful, reviews talk about car damage, etc. I'm just very careful with the device. I purchased an extra beam (Seco-Larm E-931) to have the machine retract when something gets in its way. But, the installer advised against it because they fog up and stop working, and then I'll have to call him for repair. This is exactly what the negative reviews state about safety beam, so I returned it. Installer mentioned good beams start at $200 so I opted on skipping that part and I have very careful with the machine. I have not had any problems yet and installed the machine about 2-3 months ago. I purchased this product due to the positive reviews. There are some negative reviews but I have not had any issues. The only thing to take into account is who is going to install the machine and the cost that come with it. On on another note, the control has four buttons for different options. We also opted on just using one button to open and close, we don't have all those other special features like opening the door for just a person versus all the way for a car. So only one button functions on our control. The reason we did this was because my dad wouldn't be able to figure out all the options on the control, so we went for a simple approach and nothing fancy. You can hit the button earlier on so you can stop the gate at whatever point you desire.

O.D.,5.0,2022 6 May,"
I stumbled on this item during black Friday and for the price tag I knew it was too good to pass up. I had never installed a motor for a gate before but I imagined it would not be too difficult. Upon reading the owners manual it did not require many steps and it came with most of the items I would need for the install. I was not able to make use of the square or round brackets it came with as I have a wood fence with the metal framing being much thicker than the brackets so I did have to find another solution. All in all it was a great purchase especially considering the fact that I was quoted $2000-5000 by various contractors to have a very similar motor to this one installed.
"
D. 🐢,4.0,2021 24 August,"
Pretty good gate opener for the price. Hard part was lining everything up (position of bolts on cement, how close the motor has to be to the gate to ensure the chain runs through the gears, can't forget the magnets have to be pretty close to the motor to stop, then the height of the chain, then making sure it stops in the correct postion)  and cutting the chain for the right length. I used a grinder because that's what I had. Easy to put a sensor by looking at youtube. Added a solar panel kit, inverter, and battery because we didn't want to run electricity 170 feet. Took me a weekend to install mostly due to having to let the cement dry. Only complaint is that the key was difficult to insert and remove after a few weeks and now it's stuck in the key hole. And I can't remove it. And I'm afraid if I do remove it, it won't go back in when we need it. But I can still turn the key to open the gate manually if needed. But now anyone can jump the gate and open it with the stuck key.  Cost for whole install was about $500 compared to the lowest quote we got of $1000. Now we don't get attacked by mosquitoes when opening the gate. 😀 Maybe it would have been easier to pour the cement and drill holes to use the bolts that expand instead of setting the bolts provided in wet cement hoping everything lined up. But I'm no expert installer. 🙃

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I was not sure if this gate would be as strong or capable as I wanted it to be, especially for the price, but I’m so happy I took the gamble on it.It is plenty strong enough for my 27ft x 8ft tall sliding driveway gate.  I don’t have the pickets on yet (they are out of stock due to COVID), but I am not concerned at all about it being able to handle the extra weight when I do.  And my driveway has a ~5% slope even.The instructions are not very clear, but it was straight forward enough to connect the power and pair the remotes.  I added the Seco-Larm E-931-S35RRQ sensor recommended by reviewer D. Arev’s, and I think that is a MUST HAVE since this gate is so strong it could hurt someone or a child (honestly I think it should come with one).  The photo D. Arev posted is super helpful for how to wire this in, because it was not intuitive what wire to connect where from looking at it.The remotes have good range.  I can click and open the gate from several houses down in the alley of ours.  I bought a CO-Z keypad that I put in the ally to be able to open it without a remote and it works well.Also, I added Homekit connectivity using the iSmartGate controller with their gate sensor which works great.  I love being able to use my phone to open/close the gate when I am driving/walking up to it.  To do this I ran a low voltage control wire from the CO-Z gate motor to my garage, in a conduit, that connects to the iSmartGate controller (that I also use for my garage door to be on Homekit) and installed the magnetic sensor at the leading edge of the gate and the magnet on the steel closed side post.  There is a guide on the iSmartGate website on how to wire it to the CO-Z motor.

Just had a $1800 Liftmaster go out after 4.5 years.  Had to replace a $300 circuit board during this time. Had hesitated before - but with this last issue was NOT giving the big name another $2k.Let me tell you- this is a much smaller unit that I expected.  Dynamite comes in small packages- it handles this heavy gate with ease.  For the money - you cannot beat it. Yes, you have to install magnets to stop the gate.  But again - doing the math I can get over separate remotes for the gate and garage door.  Give it a shot - it will take some elbow grease to install.  It will also take some patience to get magnets just right.

Love this opener. The instructions on the other hand are atrocious. Thanks to the other reviewers helpful comments. I had a professional installation since this was a new installation and needed power added. Hope it lasts as others said.

Kevin R.,3.0,2022 26 August,"
I bought this product and have used it two weeks the motor works fine and was easy to set up and reconnect more remotes. Only problem I found it that the magnets and not power full enough to trigger the sensor I have bought new ones and they are easy to replace just finding the right size was hard but I bought some close to size that should work fine and would make this product better

I replaced my old Gate motor with this unit,I have a 25' gate with 2 inch square tubing frame with cedar planks.. it moves it without hesitation.I reused my old chain since it was the correct length, kit comes with 2 10' chain sections which I didn't use.

Received super fast, a part was missing emailed customer service and looked for a solución asap and part was out of stock but they made sure they got it in stock asap and even offered to send me 50.00 if i did not want to wait .but i waited and got the part already. Pretty easy to install but had to look for a video since instructions are confusing. I am very happy with this seller. Can't go wrong. Thanks

This Gate opener was easy to install with the help of a handy-man friend.  However, the instructions were hard to understand, more details and illustrations would have been helpful.  What I liked best is that is very quiet to operate and works very smoothly.  It's just beautiful

I bought because of the price and good reviews in regards of strenght.Day1 - install a concrete pad of 1.5' x 1.5' with 120V power using cable 12 at least.Day2- the chain- the gate required to be extended on the back side at least 2'. This will allow the chain to be pulled for opening.  The connecting and disconnection of the chain links is some painfull. I created a small piece of wood with a mechanical cube and cement tascon screws to perform the pin removals easily and leave the anxiety for other parts of the installation.Day 3 - the installation.  I installed it on a day off the Quarintine for covid-19 no stores were opened I used all the materials from an old Microwave.  The cable and the lug nuts, washers, in fact everything needed for the installation.Ensure to have a really small flat fine screwdriver and prepare to dig a small hole in the plastic case to access some of the screws.Also ensure to have plates to hold the end for the angle. There isa big problem for gates in the Caribbean where the pole does not allow a lot of room for the magnets.  I had wished the gate magnet reader was vertically alligned with the chain to have a better distance for the magnets and will not required too much improvisation.  I had to put a limit switch in parallel with the magnet for redundancy system.At the end is solent enough and strong enough.Btw it can take a few days for an unexperience person with gates openers

I was doing a fair amount of research on which sliding gate opener to get.  Our gate opening is 20 ft and the total gate is 30 ft.  The style is a metal frame with redwood pickets, so the thing is not light.  Comparing to other more notable names in the gate opening business, the CO-Z unit was almost 10X cheaper.  I figured a couple hundred dollar gamble was worth it.Pros:-Very simple to install.  The instructions are trash, but the youtube videos out there will get you by-Strong enough to handle our gate-Magnetic stops are easy to figure out.  With sprockets facing away from you, left is lower.  Simple as thatCons:-instruction manual for wiring in a safety sensor would have been nice.  There are other reviews out there with pics of the wiring that will help you-Remote control couldn't be programmed to our built in car homelink

Great purchase!! This was easy to install but the instruction are super minimal and hard to use!! You need YouTube and common sense believe me! The sensors gave me the most headache but once i figured one is up and one is down (install one end an inch higher then the other) it was all gravy. I’m getting more remotes and a infrared sensor too so no one gets hurt and I’m gonna be all set. Very happy with this gate opener.

 I installed this a couple of months back, so far so good. I wanted to share a video so you can see my gate size, and setup.I bolted the the motor frame down with four concrete anchors, the positioning of the magnets is as others explained (one higher than the other). The magnet distance to the motor needs to be pretty close. i used some threaded bolts and spacers so i could adjust and position them easily, i have them pretty close but not touching the motor case. I bought a 50ft 14/3 gauge extension cord from home depot, cut the end off, wired it to the board, and simply plugged the other end into a regular 110V socket.  The wiring is temporary for me, I plan to use a solar panel and battery, i only use the gate a few times a day so could easily use a solar setup.The setup works really well. The price of the system is really inexpensive, the quality is good for the price - but not the best quality components, but really what could you expect for less than 200 bucks! The remotes work from a good distance. You cannot get your car or garage opener to operate the motor, according to the sellers, the remotes are the only way to open and close the gate - we have four of them. only the top button does anything, the other two buttons do nothing. the chain is showing some signs of rust - i guess that is to be expected and can easily be replaced.the motor easily opens my big metal gate, this sucker is powerful! my wife and i enjoy using it, makes like a little easier :)if this one can last for a couple of years, I will buy a 'backup' motor since they are really quite inexpensive.

D. Arev,5.0,2018 2 February,"
I'll be honest its hard to give a product a 5 star because there are always some kind of issues. When you receive this opener you'll think it was a toy. It’s really is small. Don't let that throw you off. This little thing works. I figured that for the cost you were going to get much less than you do with the larger pricier big name brands. Let me jump into it and tell you the pros but also the obstacles I had to hurdle to get get it to work.Upon reading other reviews you definitely need to purchase the outdoor safety sensor. I purchased this one:Seco-Larm E-931-S35RRQ Enforcer Indoor/Outdoor...SECO-LARMWhy do you need a safety sensor because you need to make sure the gate stops or retracts if something crosses its path. This little motor is no joke it is strong enough to crush anything in its path including a child.The sensor came with the following cables Black, Grey, White, Blue and Brown. I added a picture to show you how I wired it. *Disclaimer I am not a licensed electrician. Wire at your own risk. This worked for me.The system won't really operate correctly without a safety sensor. If you decide on getting this motor, the first thing I recommend is read your manual and get familiar with it. I connected everything before installing it just to see how it would work. This system uses magnets as limit switches and you need to get a good feel for how these work. You have a top and a bottom magnet each one with the intention of stopping the gate at the desired travel distance. Play with it and you'll get what I mean. I also installed an on/off switch in an enslosed waterproof 2 gang box so that I can turn off the motor in the event of an emergency or if I just want the gate to stay open with out it automatically wanting to close. This beats turning off your breaker from your house.

"
Rene,4.0,2021 20 October,"
Great little motor for the price. Have to modify your gate to install the stop sensor at end other then that great also the release lever to unlock the motor is weak and will lock on its own. So if your power goes out and you an lock the motor to get out better leave the gate open good chance you get locked out like what happen to me after adjusting was able to work but wouldn’t trust it.

These gate controllers (I have 2 gates) have been solid units.  They are easy to install and the directions are mostly clear.  It is important to have a solid base or the controller will rock back and forth and will change alignment.  It is easy to program the remotes.  I have 20 ft gates and they work without any problems.  I would buy again.  One last note:  the non-driving rollers on the gate should be lubricated at the time of installation since they are not lubricated at the factory.
"
Mark,5.0,2018 31 July,"
Like most of the people said the instruction suck. But this little unit work very well. I made a mistake by installed the base first, it end up I have to adjust the chain so that the gear and chain in the same line. If I have to install one more I will install it in the follow order.1. Install the chain, make sure leave extra, because it need to go around the gear.2. install the base and motor, make sure the gear and chain inline.3.connect the power.4.Click on the remote so that you can see the motor working, make sure you remember which direction it turn, use one of the magnet to stop the motor, now you find one open/close limit, install that magnet on the gate for the close or open end. do the same thing for other magnet.5. attach the chain to gear. do you remember which magnet stop which direction? very important here, because your magnet only work with this direction, attach the chain on top or under the large gear so that the gate will move left or right to get to this magnets.6. you are done with the install.7. optional, install a sensor. one of the reviewer has the wiring picture, which also work for me.I don't know if there are any different between the open or close limit, by attach the chain to the gear differently, you can move the gate left or right while the gear turning same direction.

We bought this automatic gate slider. It was meant to come with the packaging damaged but product in tact. The opener arrived without instructions, and the instructions we found online was completely unhelpful. My gate technician did install and he noted that the overall quality relative to the gate opener that I had was not as high quality. Well 6 months later, the automatic opener no longer works. When we tried the manual release, the plastic broke and the release did not work. The product was purchased January 2022 and comes with a 1-year warranty. I tried to contact the Seller. Appears they are out of business. I tried contacting the manufacturer, but there is no information.
"
alfa,4.0,2020 13 December,"
I don't understand why the sensors aren't just magnets on the chain, but instead you have to attach an arm with a magnet a VERY specific height and location. Impractical.1) The sensors should be mounted next to the chain, and the activators simply mount to the chain. It would save hardware, mounting and installation time, and space, and would perform beautifully there.2) The installation instructions were not for a beginner. I'm luckily not one, so I managed, but I couldn't imagine being an amateur and installing this.3) Some of the hardware, specifically the washers, were not big-enough to cover the entire mounting hole.The motor starts up very fast and jerks. The frame it's mounted on actually flexes, and I know it won't last forever. It' brand new, and I'm already contemplating failure mitigation.

dave,3.0,2021 5 July,"
I'm in the automated gate business. I bought this system because the price is so low. I had to see if it was any good. This is my evaluation.No Warrantee.No tech support.No place or number for ordering replacement parts.Does not use backup batteries. So if the power fails, so does the gate.You cannot use a solar power supply.I understand the installation process, but a new installer might it impossible.If the end magnets fall off or the magnetic sensor fails, the gate won't stop.On the bright side, if it does fail, it has a chain release but it's only accessible from behind the gate with a key.It's very cheap, so order a minimum of two in case the first one doesn't hold up.For the price it's a throw away product, like the old throw away cameras.I don't know how well it works yet because I can't use it. It doesn't have any support for a professional.Because of that, I won't install it for a customer. I might just sell it for what I bought it for, with an explanation and no promise.  There you have it.
"
Johnnybravo,3.0,2022 11 March,"
When installing, no matter what I tried, I could not get it to close after opening it.  It always thought open was closed, and closed was open.  So we always have to push the button again to close it.  I know, minor inconvenience.  the real trouble came after about 5-6 months of ownership.  Now, we have to get out of the car and push the gate while pushing the button to get it to work.  It's like it lost power.

Don,5.0,2020 21 December,"
Opener came well packaged and it came quickly - Instructions were good - and if you read them ""thoroughly"" before you install it............you'll be fine - it may require some custom made brackets for the chain ends or limit switches dependent on your specific applications - Just say n.All hardware needed for most installs is included and it came well packaged - I was surprised to say the least at the quality.......very nice......with that said..........I am very happy with this opener - the remotes are well built and work nicely - it's very quiet and it is working well for what I needed it for. Two solid thumbs up for this opener. It was a DIY install on a 14 foot gate - i would recommend it and I would certainly purchase it again.

Christy,5.0,2021 25 April,"
This opener is AMAZING! I have a heavy 20+ foot steel gate for our farm entrance. This opener takes 21.45 seconds to fully open it. I installed the Seco-Larm E-931-S35RRQ Enforcer to stop the gate if something (or someone) gets in the way while its closing, an MHCozy 5V 12V Inching/Self-Locking WiFi Switch Module to make it into a smart gate so I can open the gate from my phone, the CO-Z Security Wireless Automatic Entry Gate Keypad, and a Cartell CP3-100 Vehicle Sensor Kit Exit Wand to automatically open the gate as a car exits the farm. Everything functions seamlessly and amazingly quiet. Totally beat out the Mighty Mule and the money we wasted on our old opener!

Nick A.,4.0,2018 3 August,"
The house I rent is enclosed with a security fence with a sliding gate across the driveway.  It's a busy street.  This opener is perfect so I no longer have to get in and out of my truck leaving the tail sticking out into the street while I opened or closed the gate.  Having a dog stopped me from leaving it open.It was fairly simple to install.  The instruction were obviously translated from another language and not perfectly.  Probably a transaltion programs was used.  So, you have to read between the lines a lot.  But if you slow down and think it through, it works perfectly.LOL...I remember the had the start & stop magnet positions backwards.  Use some duct tape to test mount them before doing any drilling.I have had it installed for six months now and have no complaints.  I do want to find a keypad for it though so I can open it without carrying one of the remotes.  Someones else review states the one listed with the ""Frequently bought together"" window is not compatible.  They verified with the keypad manufacturer that this was the case.

 Works great.  Set the opener to auto-close in 45 seconds.  Added all of these items below and I can open the gate from my phone or voice or Alexa app or keypad or LiftMaster garage door openers.  Plus I added a Ring Doorbell to the gate post and I can view and speak to people before opening the gate with one of my Echo Shows or phone.

This is my second unit, the first worked well for four years and the only reason I replaced it was because the door where the key opens to use if the electric goes out jammed. For me to use without electric I had to undo the chain and it's a pain because I'm no spring chicken.My decision to go with the same unit was because other than that this item worked great. My son has the same unit, longer than I've had mine and he has never had any problems.

Asked Aleko for help for their old operator chain could not be put back on the drive so I had to trash the Aleko unit.Took me 4 hours to install this new COZ and noticed they made hook up a lot easier by adding a SW! to reverse the motor, if needed.  They also put in a push button terminal.  Both items were clearly marked.  Beats the old method of reversing wires, and jumping push button connections.  I used my old magnets and chain.  Both just needed slight adjustments.  I also used the old Aleko mount stand instead of having to assemble the COZ stand.  Now I have 2 units 50' apart, and both operated by single remote controls.  I programmed the top button for the big gate, and the bottom button for the little gate.  Going get a Budweiser!

Heidi,5.0,2019 30 November,"
I had to come back and leave a review for this gate opener.  The price and the reviews convinced me to give it a try.  It did not disappoint.  It has been installed for 7 months (since April) and it has been great.  We bought the sensor, the keypad and several remotes.  They all work well together.  The husband had to get a little creative installing the sensor (attached it to a piece of 2x4 which he attached to the rolling chain link gate).  This unit is one quarter the size of our old one, but it does the job and then some, including handling snow and freezing temps this weekend (we shoveled the track first).  We are going to install a second unit at the driveway entrance from the street which we share with our neighbors.Update after 3+ years...this unit and all accessories are still going strong.  No issues whatsoever.

Love it!!! Working perfectly!!!I had a fence and a rolling gate built and installed closing off my front yard, the gate is a 2""x2"" metal square tubing frame, 15' long and 4.5' high with 3/4” square tubing bars every 4"", pretty heavy gate...This little motor is rolling it back and forth with no effort at all, it is very quiet and works smooth every time.Installation was super easy, the instructions are very clear and straight forward, I also bought the completable safety photonic beam, installation and wiring was super easy and it works perfectly too.I installed an On/Off switch on the junction box at the end of the conduit that sticking out of the concrete right next to the unit and a dedicated arc fault breaker in the panel.So far I am VERY satisfied with this unit and would highly recommend it also because of the amazing price, I just love it when you are not being over charged just to put a brand name stickr on the unit's cover and you get a really good product.Thank you Co-Z.

I like the quietness of it. It was easy to install and adjust the sensors. It came with everything that is required to mount the unit and the chain to the frame. It comes with brackets for the sensors, but need to mount it to your gate how ever you can. My gate is 12feet wide and I needed to make an extension to the gate for the chain. I needed about 14 feet of chain, it comes with 2 10foot pieces.

I just installed mine today  and i’m surprised for the performance.  It took me a day to install the unit ! And that’s  only because I had to run down to local hardware store to buy some brackets and some other things ,  most hardware’s are included ,  and it all depends on your gate style ,  you might not needed. The unit is really small and quiet and it’s fast . If you are a handyman guy and fix stuff at your house ! Then you can do this with no problem at all , The owners manual is not that friendly  but like I said if ur handyman  guy then you can do it . They unit pulls max 220 watt so you don’t need to run Electrical wire to your breaker panel that’s just simply a waist of time . 220 watt is = two old light bulbs 💡💡 or = two 55” flat tv 📺📺 .  I just connected mine to an extension cord temporarily .  Overall great products  . Will see how long it will last .Update: 02/25/22Works like a champ . I am happy with it

 I have been using this gate opener for more than 1 year. Two family members open a 20'x5' gate made of 4"" box tube every day. Not a single problem. The only thing that I think would make it better is having some type of spring to absorb the initial shock when the gate opens and closes. I would buy another one if I had a need for it.

SAyers,5.0,2019 20 July,"
Amazing equipment for the price. I have a large steel 12ft sliding gate and this unit moves it with ease. I was concerned when I read that the unit was single speed, but in practice it really hasn't been that big of a deal even with my heavy gate (over 400lbs). I also bought the IR sensor recommended by another buyer, but it was about $45 and came DOA. I found another unit on Amazon almost exactly the same for $19.99.  There is no way to buy the parts and DIY an opener for less than this pre-made unit. Remotes work great. I saw a video on Youtube where some guy had pretended (he paid an installer and forgot to mention it in the video) to have installed the unit, he really downplayed the effort necessary. If it's your first install then this is not a 30 minute install project.  Heavy duty parts, not cheap junk. Working fine in 105F summer heat.

 I am totally satisfied with the CO-Z gate opener. It's so easy to install, some customizing required for me but nothing over the top to get it to work. It's super quiet, has a good open/close speed. I was sold on the fact that you can add additional controls, key pad and a safety stop sensor. They are all easy to install/program. The quality of the gears and motor all look good, keep it lubed and maintained and I think it can last for years... Hopefully. The price compared to the much bigger and expensive ones is amazing. Doing this my self was the best way to go. I saved $1200 from a quote by a professional. Definitely would recommend.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 28 June,"
This product for me was worth every penny. I can even say I got a bargain. This little thing kicks butt. My gate is about 30' long and this opener opens and closes the gate with ease. The install is surprisingly easy and anything and everything you need is provided for you. I purchased the Seco-Larm E-931-S35rrQ Enforcer photoelectric Beam sensor for it but in actuality as long as you are paying attention to what you are doing and only move your vehicle past the gate when it has stopped opening or closing, you don't really need it. It is definitely a great added feature so its up to the user. I purchased it on June 24th and installed it on the 27th so far I have only used it for testing so if anything comes up after this post I will include it here. If I haven't posted anything, it's because this little thing is still going strong. I would definitely recommend this product.

Purchased one of these in 2019 and it has already failed, so I had to buy another one so I didn't have to re weld any new mounts or brackets. Battery life on the remotes are fair, the chain and sprockets have rust on them already from the rain (yes I lubricate it every month). For the price, it's an OK system.

Product itself is great. Easy install, easy to use. However the package I got was missing the key to open the gate manually. I contacted customer service and they pretty much blew me off and won’t send a new key for a few bucks because I did not notice it soon enough. 4/5 stars for the product. 0/5 for the service. I’ll remember when I order another opener for my next gate. Thanks

All together, worth the money.Instructions are ruff. Really have to pay attention. But as far as strength. It will pull the concrete up!!My biggest set backs were (1) motor has to be mounted at gate start/opening pole.And (2) THE MOST IMPORTANT!!! IF you get it all wired and working and it either doesn't stop proper or open proper, the limit magnets can't travel thru the same path!!In other words. They pass across the square limit block on motor.thats how they shut offIf start magnet passes by bottom of square, make stop pass by top of square. This took me 2 days and a bunch of bracket fabrication to finally figure out. Ended up being simple. Example: imagine a line drawn thru the center of square. Make one magnet contact thru top line and other contact thru lower. Works fine
"
William C.,3.0,2021 26 October,"
This is a good gate opener.  Installation was straight forward with YouTube video help.  But I discovered a flaw in this gate opener.  It does not have a run limit or an auto reverse if it senses an object in the path of the gate.  If the magnet limit switches should fail, then the motor will run until the cows come home.  Maybe not a big deal, but one prospective buyers should be aware of .

The company that made it is now defunct, so I went to Amazon to find a new one that might work.  After reading many reviews, and watching videos, I decided to give this CO-Z one a shot.  Hopefully, the video will help!  I've never spent the time or submitted, a video, but I'm so pleased with this unit I took the time.

 Don’t let this little motor fool you, it has power.  Moves an iron gate effortlessly,  I tried pushing on it as it is closing and it keeps going.  I recommend installing a photo sensor in the event a child, animal or car gets in the way of it closing. I installed the Co z in about 4 hours .Also works with ALEKO LM104A Safety Photocell Infrared Photo Eye Sensor

So it works. Eventually. But you pay a price for going for the half price Asian imports.The documentation sucks. You have to guess that the dimensions are all given in millimeters. That's a minor problem.The docs give you instructions on how to set all five of the three DIP switches as well as all four of the zero variable resistors. If you need any of those functions, your guess is as good as mine.The docs are very explicit on how to press the LEARN switch on the circuit board once to sync your remote with the device. There is no LEARN switch. There IS a switch labeled ANTENNA and it happens that it will switch he device into learn mode -- if you press it twice.The open and close limits are set by magnetic switches. The docs give you instructions to mount the magnets are certain distances above the chain. Those distances are exactly backward. You can either remount them or notice that there is a switch labeled REVERSE on the circuit board.That might mean reverse but given the fact that ""learn"" is spelled ""antenna,"" you never know. Turns out it does so if you follow the directions and get the magnets in the wrong place, flip that switch.You're also likely to be shorted on hardware. I was missing two hex nuts so now you go on a search for a hardware store with metric galvanized hex nuts (hint: Lowes).I think that's everything. Good luck.

I love the gate opener itself.  So convenient now to not having to get out and open gate!  But you need to watch videos and read through others comments to actually know how to install.  The instructions are terribly written (if you want to call it written).  And yes, there are some modifications that need to be made in order for the gate to work properly, depending on your gate type.  I have a standard 12' chain link rolling gate and had in stall 2 pieces of aluminum tubing at each end the make the gate stop.

gadgetman,5.0,2021 16 January,"
Great so far. Shockingly small, but quiet and powerful. Hard to go wrong at this price. You can use vehicle HomeLink and other remotes by adding Linnear Multi-Code Receiver # 109950. (see mounting on base in photo 1. ) $30 on Amazon. Change DIP switch #1 to ""off"" (see blue switch in photo 2). On plug ""X5"", put receiver red wire on terminal ""+24VDC"" , Black wire on ""GND"" terminal. On plug ""X7""put one gray wire on terminal ""CLS"" and the other gray wire on ""COM"". Works like a charm !

This doesn’t include mounting brackets for the magnetic stopper. Also instruction are not clear. However there are bunch of YouTube video that will teach you how to install this. Watch multiple video from different creator is you are not going to cement the ground and install the L hooks.

Alex P,5.0,2021 3 November,"
The only thing I didn't like is that I needed a link breaker to shorten the chain but it's super easy to install and I doubt there are many gates it can't pull

donald demers,4.0,2021 6 April,"
I used this product for my slide gate but I wish I would have ordered additional chain as it only comes with 20"" of chain and my gate is 26' I also should have ordered 2 more remotes. Other than that the product works the way it is suppose to.

James J Shepherd,4.0,2020 12 September,"
Love the price and access to support videos.  I took my sweet time doing each task after researching.  Very simple shipped fast easy to install.  If it last two years it would be well worth my time and I would not hesitate to buy another one.  Only dislike is if the limit switch isn’t set the motor will not shut off.  So I watch it to make sure it’s functioning properly.
"
Peter,4.0,2017 5 June,"
The instructions are awful and the magnet stoppers aren't necessarily precise.  I recommend placing the magnets in closer than necessary and mark down the exact stopping location so you can adjust accordingly to avoid having the gate slam into the wall that your gate shuts against.  If the gate can just free roll, this might be less important, but something to consider!Otherwise, this is an amazing product for the price.  Seems to be well made and properly sealed for weather resistance.  It is insanely quiet, I'd say about a quarter of the decibel level of a garage door motor or less.Bedroom window about 20ft from the motor while open only allows you to hear the gate roll, no motor noise.I only am giving it 4 out of 5 stars because of the poor instructions.  If you have the ability to weld and fabricate, that can come in handy too.

This is the second gate opener the first lasted about two and a half years, this one was munch easier to use, has a test button the first one did not, Makes a big different being able to test the unit to see if it works.
"
RC,3.0,2017 12 June,"
This gate opener was easy to install and works very well on my home made wood 16ft gate. The instructions were very bad, and so I had trouble setting up the sensors, but once I got it figured out, it worked fine. I would have given it 5 stars, but it did not have all of the features described. There is no pedestrian mode, where you press a button and the gate opens a few feet and stops. I can open the gate a few feet and stop it, using the remote, but that is not a specific pedestrian mode feature. The 4 button remote is a waste of buttons, unless you have 4 gate openers. The buttons are not for open, close, and stop like the description says, it is just the same button that open, stops, and closes, kind of like a garage door opener. Lastly, if the gate encounters an object, it just keeps pushing. I damaged part of my gate because of this when I was adjusting my sensors. The motor kept running and ripped the bracket off of my gate, damaging the wood. So if there is something in the way of the gate, there will be a battle to the death. You can add a sensor, but it does not come with one. I added a wifi garage door opener switch so I can use my cell phone to open the gate, which is a nice addition.

 The install was very easy. It moves my 600lbs 18ft Metal gate easily! At first I wasn’t sold on the remotes. It’s very basic. With some research I found out that I could connect it to a E-Welink WiFi Switch.Amazon sells it for $12.99.Now I can open the gate when I’m not at home. I use it along with my Ring Spotlight Camera when I get a notification that someone is at the gate. I can let them in and close it when they leave.
"
Guillermo M.,5.0,2020 8 April,"
Took about two hours to install. Our gate is 18 ft long and takes 22 seconds to open. While it is not the fastest is it very much worth the price. Plus, the slower it opens the safer. Includes two remote controls already registered to the motor. The distance of the control is excellent. Works from a fair distance. If you need more remote controls, order from them. You need to open the motor and open the circuit box. Quick to register new control. Just hold the black button for two seconds and click any button on the new remote control.We love this motor. Very happy.

 Works great! Easy to install. We’ll need to reinforce the slab though. If it ever runs past the limit when closing (like it did once when I was testing the position of the limit) it came close to tipping that slab. It’s because the slab isn’t deep enough so... my fault! Other than that it’s perfect.

Tech support is horrible! Still have not received a call back. I mounted opener on right side and the switch is in FWD position. However, the gate will not auto close. It auto opens. Do I need to switch the motor wires? If only they would call me back! Other than that, I like the opener even though the directions are a joke! Thank goodness for all the “how to” videos out there.
"
kbt,4.0,2019 21 January,"
Like others have said, once installed this is a great little unit.  Strong, smooth and quiet operation.Our particular metal sliding gate configuration made mounting the magnets very difficult, as the magnets need to be very close to the sensor to work.  We ended up getting an experienced contractor to install this for us.  He had to make the proper welding adjustments on the gate to position the magnets so they worked.  He was also an electrician so he was able to understand the manual.  I did not want to struggle with it.This is the most official Youtube installation video I found for this opener, although it doesn't have sound:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSomiN6vEPM&t=3s  (Chain SL600ACL Installation)

DEFcon Remodels,4.0,2018 29 December,"
BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS PAGE--- THE ALEKO REMOTES AND WIRELESS KEYPADS THAT ARE RECOMMENDED/FREQUENTLY BOUGHT TOGETHER DONT WORK WITH THIS OPENER.STILL WORKING ON FINDING REMOTES AND KEYPADS THAT ARE COMPATIBLE.Opener doesn't have as many features as advertised.  The 4 button remote only uses one button and that moves the gate in the opposite direction of its last movement.  No auto stop if it hits an object, or person, it just keeps pushing.It works good. Strong motor.  Slow.  Quiet.  Setup takes a bit but not too complicated.Other than that its like a lot of budget openers; no tech support, limited info online, no warranty, but cheap.

Excalibur,5.0,2021 3 January,"
I have installed several professional grade gate openers.  I was very suprised to see how well this opener worked. It has been installed for 3 days now and is working like a champ.

Works good once you figure out how to install it. Its been said by many others that the instructionssuck, they are right.  If you have to shorten the chain by removing links be prepared for a little bitof a struggle without the right tool.  Like most I had to come up with custom brackets to hold thelimit switch magnets to the gate. I painted all the metal brackets before installation to slow the rustingprocess down.  Measure twice before installing anything. Installation was about 4 hours countingthe electric hookup and adjusting the start and stop magnets. The motor makes less noise than the gate moving on the metal tracks. The remotes worked rightout of the box and have a long range of at least 100'.

Installation would go allot easier if instructions where clearer. Have several issues that have not resolved... Biggest one is the fact that when programming for gate to close automatically it behaves totally the opposite as it does not close automatically but rather opens and stays open. Contacted seller and the response was to make a YouTube video and share the link with them so they can show it to the tech... How the hell am I suppose to do this when I haven't the foggiest idea how to use YouTube... Problem ""gate opens when it should be closed"" how will a video help you understand this.

Steve,1.0,2019 11 August,"
Don't buy this opener but if you already have and are invested as we were and now need to making it work heres how: Run a Jumper from IR to Com on the circut board only by doing this step not covered anywhere else will your gate both open and close with either a remote control, keypad (optional) or button (optional).I had ordered and got this sliding gate opener in early June 2019, We had to purchase a new gate for $600 for this unit to work with then have cement work done and track laid as well as cementing the motor and bolting to cement. Gate only opened and would not close unless you take it apart and reverse the dip switch on the circuit board then it only closes and wont open. I spent about $800 on labor and tried tech support by Amazon in the Philipines and to no avail as far as troubleshooting the problem! I contacted several managers and tech support insisting that something must be wired wrong from the factory and asked for a replacement which also had the identical problem! It was not until we got a hold of James at Aleko products who has nothing to do with this opener or its remote that he kindly helped us so that we would not have to redo all the  cement work, I would recommend buying from them instead and they are a seller on amazon but have more competitive models that are only on their site. The problem was that a jumper is required from to of the terminal blocks to bypass a photo eye which is stated in the product description as being a feature of the opener NOT an option which is not offered or available on Amazon. The Manual does not cover getting the gate work at all and has horrible grammer and does not make sense.

Nansman,4.0,2018 6 April,"
INSTALLATION NOTE:  Do your own bench test to familiarize yourself with how the motor works in relation to the magnets to automatically start and stop the motor. While the installations leave a lot of information out, the set up is very basic. Electrical hook up is easy. Look at page 16 and find ""Earth Power"" on the diagram, then correlate that to the actual motor circuit board. Pull the module out, open the wire port up by unscrewing the side screw, insert the the black wire into the ""L"" slot, insert the white wire into the ""N'' slot, and the green or ground wire into the ""PE"" slot. Use the key fob to operate the motor.I'll upload other videos on programming the key fobs as I get these installed.

I would give it six stars if I could! What a wonderful little motor! Some things to note:1) Super quiet2) Very strong3) Easy to install4) I had no problems with instructions, they are not IKEA style, but if you read thoroughly they are enough.5) The chain that comes with it is easy.6) Took about 5-6 hours total to complete the project7) We drilled holes in cement and inserted cement anchors and this works like a charm. Super strong.8) Remotes work from really far away.9) My gate is on an incline but it works perfectly anyways!10) The only challenge we had was calibrating the magnets. Instructions don't say that they are actually different. (They look identical). where we realized that the magnets are different from each other, so we flipped them around and they worked perfectly!

This was simple install. To take advantage of the max opening of your gate, consider installing your CO-Z on a concrete pad to the side of your driveway, this will allow max opening.  We also installed a CO-Z Wireless Automatic Entry Gate Keypad (not shown), this is very convienient.

Very happy with the operation of this automatic gate opener! Istalation is a bit on the tedious side as the instructions that are included leave a lot to be desired. The videos posted by other consumers were extremely helpful and allowed me to install with no issues. I’ve been using the gate opener for about a month now and the operation is very smooth. I wish I could pair the remote signal to the garage opener button on my car as I have done in the past but unfortunately this feature is unavailable. Still 5 starts in my opinion because not having to get out in the rain to open the gate is worth every penny!

We are handy but we did struggle with the instructions a bit. Actually the initial install was fine where we got stumped was wiring the photo sensors. Once we got that ironed out it works great so far. My hubby lost his remote somehow so we had to get an extra one and the programming was thankfully nothing. Just had to open the motor cover, locate the little black button near top left of control board and press it, then press the button on the remote - it blinked slowly and then that was it boom done. Smart little motor and super quiet.

Not a bad little opener, just installed and everything appears to work as intended, My biggest complaint is the misleading information during purchase. In the ""frequently bought together"" section it shows this opener along with an Aleko LM171 wireless keypad for A?C AR1400 openers and remote transmitters Aleko 2LM123, neither of which I have found to be able to control this opener? Contacted seller of keyless pad and they said this will not work with the CO_Z gate opener, not sure why anyone would purchase these (3) together (as advertised and I purchased) since they do not work together! Kinda like selling motorcycle tires for your new car rims?
"
Micah Gove,4.0,2019 31 January,"
If you can do your own oil changes and brake jobs on your car you can install this unit. Needs a small concrete base. Takes some time and thought to get sensors setup right. One simple thing I found was that when gate opened the sensor would trip it to stop opening but the gate would roll a couple more inches throwing sensors out of time. So I put a stop in the full open position so the gate would stop at the same spot the sensors would kick off the motor. This worked well.

Most everything but the lack of instructions are awesome. This project was challenging for me, and I consider myself to be a pretty handy guy. If you've read any of the reviews you know the instructions are close to non-existent and what instructions there are, are almost useless. I knew this going in and was confident I could figure it out, and I did, but it took much longer than expected. The only other complaint about the actual product is the brackets for the magnets. I had to fabricate my own. Other than that, it's a nice product. Strong, quiet motor, good quality.

This is NOT a complete kit in anyway. Be prepared with a chain link tool and fabrication skills. Instructions are useless and video is wrong. Once installed the unit does work well and for the price its good. Also important note, there is NO fuse or current overload in the unit! So if the gate gets stuck the motor will keep going till a breaker pops or the motor burn out.

the product is very good  but it will be great if they have customer service and also if they have a kit that includes the sensors and some zwave control so if you have cameras and someone leaves your gate open you can close it from your iPhone.

Today it Stopped working totally dead!.  Power is perfect to the motor but it won't open or close.  Makes it very difficult to get in and out of our house and there is no contact on the company page to file a warranty request!!!

It is very strong and works great.As almost everyone has been saying, the instructions are quite inadequate.Measure before you start placing the brackets and the motor. Remember the chain has to be at the same height with the motor gear. The magnets are used to stop the motor when closing and opening. They are not the same, one is used for opening the other for closing; you have to play with them to determine which is which and where in the back of the motor are the correct spots.This part can be tricky. The system uses very little power.

Felipe Ramirez,3.0,2020 26 August,"
After about two years the original one that I purchased stopped working. Considering the price, I decided to purchase a second one. It's still more cost effective than hiring a pro to have a look at it. I guess the old adage applies: you get what you pay for. I'll be sure to update after using the second one for a few months.When it worked, however, it did a great job. Also very quiet.

Desert Daisy,5.0,2018 3 November,"
Installed by novice on a 16-ft steel roll gate and we are very pleased so far.  Was an easy install, but did require a bit of trial & error in setting the stop magnets.  Opens and closes nicely.  We don't understand the 4 button remotes, as it only works on one button (push once - activates OPEN, push again - activates STOP, push again - activates CLOSE).  It does what we need it to do. Still working great for 8 months after install. Thanks

Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 8 January,"
We've been wanting an automatic gate for a while now due to trespassers so we decided to get this one. Installation was a bit difficult but if you make sure to READ EVERY SINGLE DIRECTION LISTED, you'll have a perfectly great gate installed. :) There's a few tutorials for this make too, which help our installation by 100000x! I've had this gate for a few weeks now and couldn't be happier. Highly recommend!* I will update if anything were to go wrong OR great.
"
Matthew Rios,5.0,2020 11 April,"
Buy it.. it works pretty well if you know even a little bit about electronics. We needed a longer chain and got it at tractor supply. Just look up on how to program the key fob on YouTube. I’d get a sensor if I were you, it’s really strung and could possibly Be dangerous
"
Edwin Giovanni Croeze,5.0,2019 19 December,"
I was hesitant in purchasing this door opener due to the price. However, the saying ""you get what you paid for"" does NOT apply here. The opened is built well and was very easy to install. Our 16' date is heavy as it's made out of thick aluminum but the opener is working it with no problem. I definitely recommend this to anyone.

Replaced my 18 year old Apollo with this little gem. Actually modified the Apollo control box and mounted this CO-Z inside. Instructions alittle fuzzy but not bad if you have any gate or overhead door experience. Remotes learned easily and the motor is rated to pull up to 1400 lbs. Pulled my with easy. Oh, the remote works about 300 feet!! Crazy. Couldn't be happier after fighting that old Apollo. Great product guys.
"
Chad,1.0,2020 23 February,"
It was actually pretty easy to install. My only issues are with the remotes it comes with. I have to be within 1-3 feet of the motor to get it to open. I have purchased 3 extra remotes with the same results. I asked if there was a way to extend the frequency and someone mentioned changing the batteries, which I did, with no improvement. I also purchased the wireless key pad that goes with this unit and thought it works, it too has to be about 2 feet away from the motor unit which does me no good. The seller responded to my question and flat out told me that the remotes arent compatible EVEN THOUGH they are the ones that came with the unit in the box. I plan on installing another rolling gate but will be forced to go with one of CO-Z's competitors in hopes that the remotes will work at a better range as described.** I'm pretty unhappy with this product. Other reviews lead me to believe I got a definitive model. The whole purpose of this is to not have to get out of the vehicle to open/close gate. The range on the remotes is so terrible that I have to get out and point remote at the opener from 2 feet away at best. What really sucks is, I've already installed it and can't return it now. I hate this piece of crap.

Gate motor works great! Kit came with every thing u need to mount the stand for the motor and all brackets for sensors and chain. FYI if u gate is longer than 20ft you will need to order more (#41 roller chain) $16.99 for 10ft! Good deal. Comes with master links too.Doesn’t tell u much about power and wat is required.I ran a 15amp breaker and #12 gauge wire

I just finished installing this CO-Z Automatic Sliding Gate Opener on our 15 foot sliding RV gate. The instructions along with the online video provided just enough detail for me to figure out how to assemble, install and connect everything. Would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good deal and isn't intimidated with doing their own installation, or even having someone else with good technical skills install it for them.

I was surprised by the small size of the motor, but it can open and close large doors with ease and minimal noise. We have a metal gate that is 16 feet long and 7 feet high at the highest point. The remote opens and closes from 100 ft away or more when we are driving close to home. Overall a great deal compared to other, more bulky, options.

Everything for the unit was easy to install. That took about 2 hours from start to finish. I installed a safety sensor and that was a little difficult due to the sensor tell you to connect to the normally open/close and the unit doesn't identify the connection's that way. The sensor has 5 wire but only use for of them with this unit. Very happy with the unit and for the cost it's well worth it's value.

This is the worst product I have ever had the misfortune to buy. The first one lasted about one year. I installed it myself over a period of two weeks. The instructions were written in English, however trying to understand what they are trying saying is extremely difficult because its made in China. Because of the difficulty on installation I paid a gate installer to come out and fix it. He new what it was right away. It was a defective part on the board. So I ordered a new board, and had him out again. The board had the same problem. Each and every time I tied contacting the manufacture with no return calls or emails. So then I ordered a new gate opener, yep you guessed it the same symptoms and problem with the board. After asking them to refund me for the installer visits,  I was very insulted when they told me to get a new one and they would discount it $40.00. Amazon as always was great, and refunded all my cost on purchased items. I will buy another replacement gate through Amazon but not from the company.

Dan Halderman,1.0,2017 14 July,"
Worked for a few months, then remotes stopped working followed all the steps in the book, changed remote batteries, deleted and re-added the remotes etc.  all my troubleshooting points to a bad circuit board in the unit. I tried to contact the seller Banyan Imports with no success. Can not find any technical support for the product. The troubleshooting tips in the manual are basic common sense things like change battery, reset unit. No information on how to contact manufacturer or warranty. Spend the extra dollars and get a known name brand that has tech support and warranty information.Update: Finally got in touch with Banyan Imports, the re seller of this unit, they agree that it was a bad board and sent me a new one... Received the new board in the mail today, (a day later than promised) was not pleased at all. Box was crushed at one end and absolutely NO packaging material to help keep it protected. Come on people this is a circuit board. If the one that was in the original unit was safe and enclosed in the unit and possibly suffered damage from shipping what makes you think shipping a new board in the smallest box possible with out packaging is going to keep it safe. Will install it tomorrow (Saturday) but not feeling to confident right now.

dustin,1.0,2018 28 August,"
The install was a bit of a chore, but finally got everything set up and working correctly. I have had this unit for about 1 year now and it works, but the auto close feature works sometimes and sometimes it doesnt, also the range of the remotes at first were really good after about 2 months use they got to where they would only work from about 10ft or so, I purchased about 8 remotes all with the same performance.  If this unit would consistently work like it did when new it would be ok. Also not a big fan of the magnet system, it doesnt look good on the gate and I had to purchase additional much stronger magnets for the unit to function properly.Update:  Unit quit working all together, went ahead and got another one, the opener came damaged with a big crack in the cover and one of the cover mounting points busted off. The packaging did not look damaged, which leads me to believe they shipped it out this way.

With the remotes, the unit opens & closes sliding gate ""A"" ok with the included magnets. Works great with optional  sensors also. Instructions were not the greatest for a novice, but for the  electricians it was ok.

Nichole Lankes,2.0,2018 15 October,"
We bought two of theses gate openers last Nov 2017 which are easy to install and gates worked great. We are coming to our year mark and only one gate motor works now. The main gate motor will no longer open the gate we can’t even re program the remotes  which we thought was the problem at first. there is a red light on so we know it has power. We are no longer  eligible for return or replacement on amazon. And the manufacturer is painfully hard almost non existent to get ahold of. To bad for the money I would have expected these gate openers to work longer than a year!

Adrian Gonzalez,1.0,2017 17 December,"
I know I should have gone with my gut instinct this purchase. I'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for but I took a chance with this gate opener. I was excited after I had read all the 5 star reviews. I also read all the 1 star review and had major concerns since the 1 star reviews mostly talked about the motor and the parts being bad, but I bought it anyway. Of course it was too good to be true. It only took two weeks for the motor to burn out. BUYER BEWARE, this opener sucks!  I'm now going to have to pay my electrician to come out yet again to install a new motor. What pisses me of the most is that this same electrician told me not to buy it. =( I have no idea why Amazon is allowing this crap to be sold on their website!

I finally got this installed,  due to pandemic could not get anyone out to install. Yes it has been in my garage since the end of 2019 but just opened and apparently it is defective.  I contacted support and they said sounds like a problem with the limit switch. They suggest i but a new one and they will give me a 20% discount.  I would have hoped for better service than that. It really is not my fault noone would install.

 I wasted my time to install everything..it just doesn’t move my gate…light is on; close and open light is on…we can see the motor move without chain however when we put chain on , it doesn’t budge…Plus the emergency switch make me scared if something goes wrong that switch is easily break from the motor.Save yourself money and time…get different gate.I will return and hopefully they give my money back…since it does not work and it is still within 30 days return window.

The analog magnet switch to decide when to stop the gate is beyond stupid. Installed everything in about two hours but have been playing with magnets now for two days and it's only getting more depressing. The amount of time I've invested plus the cost of the equipment I've passed the cost of the quote given to me by a company that would have installed good equipment. If looking to do it yourself buy something with automatic sensors to detect if the gate is open or closed.

Horrible gate opener. I have had several gate openers over the past 20 years and this one has been the worst. Would only work in one direction and the latch to disengage was stuck in the open position. I could not get ahold of any tech support. Returned after not being able to get to work. Save your time and money and buy a better and more expensive brand.  ☹️

Can someone from this company please contact me back I’ve reached out several times with absolutely no response. The machine is only closing the gate halfway, it pulls open fine and worked closing for 3 weeks and now only goes about half way, it does not even come near the magnets and I have to assist it with a little tug to make it keep going. Not satisfied with the motors performance and my gate weights about 250 lbs at most

 I Just finished installing the unit and it works when I manually close the gate and opens with the remote but when I use the remote to close the gate won’t close and makes that noise please if someone knows how to fix let me know.

I bought this unit last year and installed it myself.  The opener itself works fine but it has no sensor to prevent it from closing on your car. The instructions say you can get one, but after a four month search and the purchase of one the seller says will work, it still does not. So far it has damaged four cars and the seller still offers no solution. all I want is to buy the correct sensor.

Spend the extra $100 bucks and go with the Aleko, we had it five years and needed a replacement because the hurricane damaged it. the Aleko AC2400 was out of stock so went on the cheap and ordered this one. Big mistake and lesson learned! Sent back for a refund and waited to the Aleko to come back in stock

I only give it 4 stars due to the lack of keypad option, poor Chinese/English instructions and Amazon's incorrect suggestion for accessories. Otherwise, the gate opener has been (so far) excellent, specially for the price. The ""little"" motor packs a punch. It operates my 18', 500+pound gate without any issues. Takes some time to decipher the Chinese/English-written manual, but the wiring schematics are accurate.#1. No, this opener will not work with the Aleko 171 (or any other wireless keypad).#2. There are two options for control boards made for this model. Amazon describes ""pedestrian mode' as well as a myriad of other options that are not available with this purchase. This particular model comes with the PY600ACN control board and not the ""Smart Control Board (which is the one with these additional options).#3. Limiter switch is controlled by the 2 magnets. They are very sensitive as to the placement in relation to the control board. The metric measurements, in the manual, are of little help. Use ""The Google"" to figure out what they mean in inches. the 35 and 97 height measurements are in MM, not CM.#4 Unit is set from the factory to open from the right side of the gate. If you need it to open from the left there is a SW1 switch that has to be selected (again, I'm translating what seems to be a vague description of a fairly important function)#5 The control board has 24V output voltage, making it pretty difficult to pair with any 12V accessory (wired keypad, IR sensor, etc..)You can buy additional remotes (which are super-easy to program with the use of a ""learn button"" on the control board). https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0197QYJCC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1This begs the question as to; why in the world can't  a wireless keypad be synchronized with the opener in the same manner as a remote? It's a mystery...

Eric G.,5.0,2019 19 August,"
You have to mess with the hardware a bit, and it may even require additional hardware depending on your specific configuration (as I had to), but all-in-all it's a nice little motor.  I would caution you to NOT have too heavy a gate, as that might overwork the unit.  I was originally going to use a wood-clad (2""x6""s, 2""x4""s), steel-framed gate, but after doing the weight calculations it would have weighed 600-700lbs (not to mention the lumber cost)!  I opted instead to use a 75lb, steel tube gate ($200 @ Tractor Supply Co.), which in practice, weighs even less when it rolls so very little stress on the unit. Also, this set-up is definitely not typical.  Since I had a 14' gate and a 13' 3"" opening to secure I had to extend a horizontal ""arm"" (pipe) outside of the gate's ""Closed"" side frame on which to terminate the chain and attach one of the magnets.  To avoid this hassle make sure your gate is at least 18"" longer than the opening you need to secure.  (And even then that's assuming you mount the unit flush with one of the post's.)
"
steve,3.0,2021 8 August,"
My unit worked fine for about 5 years, now it only works if the remote is one centimeter away from the unit (and that's sometimes) seems like quite a few people had this problem, some said it's a faulty inferred sensor(which I don't have) some said it's the main board, some said its new LIGHT Bulbs that jam signals!??? , and yes I changed my batteries, twice! When it works it's a great unit, but seems like some point in time you will run into this problem, and it's unclear on exactly how to fix it. I'm not sure if the components are not durable.
"
Rick,4.0,2020 24 January,"
Relatively easy to install, works very good, I like the self closing feature.  My only gripe is that the documentation is incomplete.  There are no good measurements as to how far back from the gate to install the unit, etc. With better documentation I would give it 5 stars. I believe that the infrared sensors also should not be an option, the are necessary to safely install the opener to prevent damage to vehicles.

As some have said.. Instructions need some updates.  Inch convertions are noted but you have to look carefully through the book.  Place the magnets 5/8"" away from sensor instead of 7/8"" to work better.  Magnets do stop motor dead upon lining up with the sensor pad.

Hi guys I would like to highly recommend this product I have it for about 5 years on a metal gate of about 16f x 6f it was an easy installation and I never have a problem with it always work as it shouldAt one time I thought to install a magnet lock but several times I try to open it myself and that little thing is so strong that I never open it without the remote control so I decided not to install the lockVery good  productAlso if you get extra remotes as I did for all my vehicles is so easy to program itThank youRaul Vazquez

One of them operated on its own then had a humming sound so i had to turn the power off. Had the motors tested and found they were good so the diagnosis is that ths electronic boards are bad.
"
Eugene Fera,2.0,2021 23 July,"
When pushing the gate remote, the gate moves a few inches and then stops.  Push again, same thing.  4 or 5 TIMES.  I usually get so frustrated I get out and manually open.  It ALWAYS CLOSES WITH ZERO ISSUES.  There is nothing on the tracks nor in the path of the eye.  If so, it would not close perfectly every time.

 I'd highly recommend this unit for DIYers. It's easy to install if your handy. Drilling the holes for the concrete was the hardest part. I had a friend weld the mounts for me since I couldn't use the mounting accessories that came with it. I'm planning power this unit using a solar set up to avoid running a power line from the garage.

 Instructions do suck as many people have said. Support also sucks. I asked 3 questions only the least important one was answered and it was wrong. I wasted 3 days waiting on them to respond. So I went on with the installation. I was half way done and got a reply about the sprockets not being in line with the motor.I have to say the product is great if you can work with minimum instructions. This was my first one the next one will be much easier.

 First off this thing is sooooo small that you can virtually install it in any space. Didnt really look at the instruction because the text was so small you couldn't read them anyways luckily youtube has alot of people that have this same opener. I didnt use the supplied bracket because it was too low and in my area the water gets alittle high every now and then. Positioning the sensor was a little tuff and depending on what side you have the dipswitch at is where you set the magnets. I would recommend having a welder buddy as it makes the installation alot easier. Also I would highly recommend installing sensors because this little thing is strong and won't stop til you stop it, there are no safety switches built into the motor itself. Im orsering another one for another house because it serves a purpose for what I need.
"
Jay,3.0,2020 22 July,"
Pros: the motor is quite not very big.Cons: it wont link with the openers in the cars.The magnets to turn the motor off have to lined up exactly. I spend about 2 hours getting in the exact spot to line them up.

It took about 2 to 3 hours to set up and it wasn't that hard, the instructions were pretty clear. If anything you can look up YouTube videos. It only comes with 2 keys, so if you need more just purchase the exact same kind. We've had this gate opener for for a little less than a year and the chain has only fell off once. I think it rolled over a rock, but it was easy to put it back in place. We love not having to slide the iron gate open and close all the time.

Opens my 17' steel frame, picket covered rolling gate with ease. Even has to pull It open at an incline! Pour your pad large so you have plenty of room to position and anchor the motor.  Remotes work awesome and additional are only $10. Such a deal. I was quoted $2500 for a gate opener plus installation costs. Crazy cheap and works awesome.  Came with everything needed but opted to drill and place anchors in concrete after pouring for ideal placement so had to buy the anchors.

Dare I say this has been the best purchase from Amazon of all time?  Could be.  We bought a home 10yrs ago with a sliding gate in the back that protected a driveway to the back garage.  The gate opener was an old mangey beast of sorts, motors, gears, limit switches, antient 286 looking motherboard, hacked RF receivers, all in a huge rusting metal box.  The unit worked a couple years but then started dying slowly.  The contactor would come and go and and then finally it wouldn't work at all after me tinkering with it and spending hundreds of $$ on it.  My guess is the motherboard fried.  Upon getting a quote for $5k from a fencing company to ""replace"" it, I decided to find an alternative. Another company I contacted suggested I look at this product.  Usually these types of things don't' work out, but I can honestly say this one did 100%.  The unit is great, bought two of the CO-Z wireless remote PIN pads, which work great and from 75+ ft away.  The key fobs are a bit heavy but they work from quite a ways away as well.  I was a bit intimidated to install it, but taking it slow, I was able to do most of it by myself.  I did have an electrician friend help me wire it up safely.  The unit just works, and keeps on working, day after day.  So far I've had it about 5 months and its survived rain, snow, near zero temps and keep on going.  I did have one slight problem with the magnet not stopping it when closing, but a vertical adjustment fixed it quickly, not the unit's fault.  If I can remember, I'll post a follow up when I get a full year out of it.

I bought this 2018 and still working. I have a 12 feet custom gate made from 2inch OD pipes and wood which is very heavy and had no problems with the opener. 2 years past and still no sign of any issues or weakness in power. Motor is very strong. Some vibration sounds when it runs but was only coming from the cover which can be minimized easily. I only opened it again because i bought extra key fobs and set it with the machine very easily and no problems. I do not work in trade and have no experience with the install but was able to put it up by myself (excluding electrical work). I read the manual repeatedly to understand how to install it properly.  It even has instructions to add other optional features. Im looking to get an IR gate sensor for additional safety features. Im very satisfied with this mean machine.

 I found it fairly easy to install this co-z gate opener. I built my own gate, 20 feet long. I put it up on a track because here in Canada we get a lot of a snow on the ground. Everything is working perfect so far, it's been 4 months now. I love.

Anthony,1.0,2019 9 December,"
I like the price, it was easy to install, it opens my gate under ideal circumstances.I dislike that it has very little power on startup, once the gate is moving it takes a good force to stop it, but you need to keep the chain excessively loose so the motor is up to speed before the chain comes taut and then the sudden jerk will start the gate moving. Not a good recipe for long life. It comes with 2 keychain remotes but good luck getting any extras to work, I have tried several different ones and none will work. I have to reach the manufacturer but so far have been unsuccessful. If I had my time back I would spend the extra for better quality.

"
Peter W,5.0,2022 7 October,"
Nice batteries and last a long time in various remotes and smart locks. It comes out of the package with 1.58 volts and seems to keep up with other name brand batteries. For the cost, this is a no brainer as it does last just as ling and performance is about equal to other batteries. I have had no issues using theses in flameless candles and for remotes, they seem to last over a year as it is in my FireTV remote. Highly recommend these as they work perfectly with no issues.
"
Rex R.,5.0,2022 18 October,"

I wasn't expecting much from these batteries, maybe a bit better than those from Dollar Tree lol...but I was quite pleasantly surprised! They have ample power and last as long as Duracell or Energizer in my opinion. Will definitely purchase again when we run out.

Gilbert Noyes,4.0,2022 26 April,"
I use this in a small ""weather station"" that shows indoor/outdoor temp and humidity. It has a large LCD panel with backlight. I use it with a timer so that when it's during the ""sleeping hours"" the timer goes off and the backlight only runs an additional 15 seconds or so, but otherwise is still updating the display and showing the temps. Batteries last quite a while, and there's no real point to using rechargeable ones.
"
RB,4.0,2022 16 March,"
I think the price for 20 was really good. Problem is there were only 16 in the box. I used 3 each on 5 flameless candles I replaced the batteries for, and there is only 1 left in the box; thus 16 total count. I'm not very happy about that. I'm not sure about the longevity of the product, as this is the first time I have purchased this brand, so we'll see. These were sent really fast (1 day) from Amazon, and I love that.
"
Bobbaloo,5.0,2022 2 July,"
These batteries are just as good as the brand name batteries we all buy thinking they last longer. I guess it would just depend on what your using them for, but general household items they are great!!!! again, My opinion!
"
craig,4.0,2022 2 June,"
Good enough for a remote
"
TonyaS,3.0,2022 28 March,"
I did not expect much for that price, but I only needed them for my Amazon Fire TV remote. I use it once a day in the evening to turn it on, select something to watch, and turn it off again. 2 batteries lasted for about a week. And it wasn't just a fluke. Those batteries are minimally charged and this is horrible for the environment. I bought a set of rechargeable ones from EBL, which is much better for the environment anyways!Edit:So although the rechargeable ones did last a bit longer, I found out that the real problem was that the remote to my fire TV was defective. It was a brand new one so I got it replaced and the rechargable batteries last way longer now. I felt like it was only fair to update this, however, I was unable to test how these batteries actually work, since I had gone through all 20 of them and did not get them replaced.  It doesn't matter though, I love my rechargeable ones. I never have to buy batteries again, when they run out I simply switch them with the other pair and recharge them!
"
Sara,3.0,2022 27 August,"
They do fine for things like the remote, but in something that requires any type of power skip this battery and just buy good ones. They do good in some things though that don't require constant power.

****Lee****,5.0,2022 12 April,"
With three kids and tons of electronics I go through batteries rather quickly.  I decided to give these a shot given they were priced more attractively than the name brands I have typically purchased in the past.  To be honest - i wouldn't be surprised if these were manufactured by the name brands and then rebranded to Amazon.  They quality and duration of use seem to be very comparable.  For the price - i can live with any slight differences and am happy with their performance.

Batteries were very affordable. However, after a short period of use and one of my devices they died earlier than any had before. I thought it might just be a fluke with the ones I had in it but it wasn’t. They just run out very quickly.

They're batteries. They power things. Haven't had any leak or fail to last. Decent batteries, doing what batteries do. It's nice to have a great whack of them in a drawer because you always seem to not have one when you need a battery.

Considering their cost and environmental impact, they last long enough in all those devices that rechargeable ones might just start failing due to age ANYWAY, and then I'd be out a lot more money and doing environmental damage never having even gotten the maximum use from them.

Connie P,5.0,2021 23 March,"
I used to only buy name brand batteries and it became expensive to keep replacing them.  So one time, I tried dollar store batteries for my child’s game.  Even brand new, the dollar store batteries did not have enough power to properly operate the game.  I then tried Amazon Basics batteries.  I have been using them for a while now, and haven’t run into any issues like that.  I have not had problems with leaking or corrosion either.  The batteries seem to last a sufficient time, although I really don’t keep track.  Bottom line, these Amazon Basics batteries seem to be good batteries for the money.

Jacqui,3.0,2022 25 March,"
I’ve purchased a few batches of these over the years. And I thought I was going crazy when my remote control would die sooo fast. Like, so fast that you realize it. Usually when your remote dies, it happens in a way that you’re like, yea, it doesn’t raise any alarms. But these! So I started paying attention. My remote for my tv dies in 2 months! The gaming controllers die after 2-4 uses! Not worth it

I'd say they're superior to most of the dollar store varieties. Actually... all of them. These are pretty good quality. Definitely would recommend for anyone not using a super high drain device, or something that's mission critical. You wanna put these in your TV remote and forget about it? These are your batteries. Clock on the wall? These. Some sort of life-saving device? No. Don't cheap out, buddy.Only issue (if you can call it that) is that it's a huge pack! I have absolutely no idea how I'm going to use all these. Between my TI-83, TI-84 and a couple clocks (and of course my TV remote) I'm pretty well set for the next 5 years on this one purchase.

"
Dana A.,5.0,2020 24 November,"
I wanted to reorder this item, but it was out of stock, and I was forced to purchase a well-known name brand.  I won't say the brand name, but they are blue and silver in color.  I use a lot of these in stick-up lights in my dark hallways.  I was shocked how quickly the name brand petered out.  I ordered the Amazon brand again before I was halfway through the others.  I use the Amazon batteries in things that use a lot of power like hall lights and flash lights, and have relegated the name brand to use only in my remotes, where they again under-perform, but not quite as spectacularly as in lighting.

Like a lot of us, when my AAA batteries die they all go at once, or at least it seems!  The AmazonBasics multi pack is a great value, in my opinion.  Do they last as long as the ""name"" brands?  I really cannot say, but I do know the life of these are satisfactory.  Price compare and you can buy these with confidence.  And, I feel with the number of batteries AMZN must sell, I believe their batteries to be fresh.

"
Rich,4.0,2020 21 November,"
I bought these batteries almost exclusively based on the ratings of other reviewers. What make one battery better than another - price versus longevity. The price on these was certainly lower than something like a Duracell but will they last as long? Too soon to tell but I'm betting they won't. However if they last 80% as long but cost 50% as much then they are worth it. Only time will tell.

Bought these after reading reviews and comparisons online. I use them in a foxpro predator call . I cant say how long they'll last but so far 2 days of calling and their still going strong. I checked the voltage in all 48 when I got them cause I was skeptical about how good they are and didn't think they would all check out but they all read 1.620 volts. !!

Have bought amazon basics batteries for years.  They used to come in a recyclable cardboard box that stacked well on a shelf and kept the batteries contained.  The new plastic pack is annoying and once you open an end, the batteries tend to fall out all over the place.
"
Derek Webb,5.0,2020 1 November,"
And they work well. The best part about them is the amazon logo with the pretty grey and green. Sometimes I just lie there in bed, caressing the batteries close to my heart. They're so pleasurable. They can provide energy for a variety of products, including tickle me elmo's and other rubbery-devices: such as remote controls and hand held flashlights. Aint nothin basic bout deez bad boys.

Unless you're buying these at the Dollar Store (not usually great expiration dates on those, though), the Amazon AAA batteries are a good value for the amount of them you get.  Work well, good price, far-off expiration dates.

"
GoodVibes,1.0,2022 3 May,"
I cannot believe I have not deleted these off of my subscribe and save, I'm so disappointed in myself! I bought these batteries mainly for my LED lighted makeup mirror that only takes batteries. There are very few things in my household that take batteries these days. Well it takes four of these batteries and they last a whopping three days every single time I change them. So at least twice a week I am changing his batteries. I did the math for the higher priced brand-name batteries in these by far are not the better deal. And to add on the frustration of having a dim light right when you need it the most and having to swap out batteries when you are already running late for a hot date  it definitely is not worth it!
"
David Salerno,5.0,2021 27 June,"

"
Shopper,1.0,2022 27 June,"
They maybe cheaper, but in the end...Im spending more money bc they don't last. I won't be buying them again. They are a step above the Dollar Tree batteries that die so fast they are annoying. The leaking battery is just unacceptable. I had higher expectations of something Amazon puts its name on. Lowering the bar.
"
Madison,1.0,2022 5 March,"
Day 1 the lights were pretty bright. Day 2 is the second photo. Needless to say I went through an entire pack of 15 in 3/4 days. I use these tiny lights for maybe 3/4 hours per evening. They’re off all day because I use natural light for my aquariums, and I turn them off when I go to bed. So, these batteries suck— in other words. Waste of money and time. Should’ve just bought the good brand for a few extra bucks.

I got these as a refill for my label maker. As soon as I placed the new batteries in, it displayed the “Low Battery” sign. I didn’t bother returning them, and still have/use them now. Overall, the battery life didn’t last long.

I bought these batteries for my pulse oximeter. The original batteries lasted 2 years, I put in 2 of these batteries and in 3 days they were dead, I thought I might have put them in wrong so I replaced them with 2 new ones and same thing, 2 days they were dead. When a price is to good to be true you know something is wrong!

"
Debbie,2.0,2022 9 July,"
I use a portable nebulizer and these batteries or the 2 nebulizers we’ve purchased from Amazon as well. Neither are working after I use the batteries for 1 week. I’ve wasted about $150.00 trying to save a few bucks but as we’ve heard, we get what we’ve paid for. Junk. Since all this, I ended up having to get an electric nebulizer from Medicare and that thing is very loud but at least it works, not mobile though. What do I do?  Settle? I suppose. Disappointed? For sure.

Sam,5.0,2022 22 October,"
Covid straight up ruined my hair skin and nails. My old cuticle oil wasn't cutting it as my nails became dryer and dryer. Biotin supplements did nothing to help. I ordered this hoping for the best. Boy, did this deliver.No lie, after one night my nails are soft and crazy moisturized. It smells fantastic. Very light scent. A little sweet( like honey) but not sickly sweet like a lot of products can be. I want to BATHE in this. Right now, I'm content for my nails getting some much needed love. I've already recommended it to others, and will be buying some more to give as gifts.

 This is by far my favorite cuticle oil, and I will always go back to buy more when I run out. It smells very pleasant, but not too strong. It’s very hydrating, and is essential when growing strong, healthy nails! I like to dab a very small drop into each cuticle, and gently massage it in and all over my nails as well, let it sit for 5-10 minutes, then use some lotion on my hands to help seal it in. I do this twice a day every day, and I have seen a huge difference. Highly recommend:) It has made my nails SO much stronger also. Such an amazing product!

 I applied it once and my cuticles look great automatically. My skin soaked it up with no issues. You only need a tiny amount. I love that the dropper is narrow at the tip allowing for precise application but I was really looking forward to that amazing milk and honey scent which is NOT there. I purchased this specifically for the scent but it doesn't compete in that area. A bit bummed out about it considering the price.

Lis,3.0,2022 10 September,"
It’s not bad but it’s not good. I been using it consistently for a week or so and notice no difference. It also leaves my hands oily for a long time which I don’t like. Can’t tell what the hype is about
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 13 May,"
…and I know my cuticle oils. I have the worst, driest cuticles known to humankind. I’ve blown through bottle after bottle of other oils, which I had to apply multiple times a day to have any effect. This stuff needs to be applied 1-2 times a WEEK, max. That + price point + pleasant, light milk and honey scent make this a holy grail for me.
"
Sue,4.0,2022 28 March,"
Moisturizing but, there really is no scent to it. Seems like an oil. Just add a little to have healthy cuticles and nails.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 18 July,"
Very moisturizing, helps soften cuticles for easier removal.
"
Angela K,3.0,2022 16 July,"
I got the milk and honey scent. It smells very weird. Can't even put my finger on what it smells like. Also very greasy but it works so far. Just scared to touch anything because I don't want grease stains on my clothing or anything else
"
Bee,5.0,2022 2 June,"
I have super dry cuticles. I literally will get a pedicure and two days later my feet will be dry and literally crusty. This oil has worked  Miracles. I am thoroughly impressed.
"
Dallas,5.0,2022 13 March,"
Sooooo, I do my own nails at home and I also do my husbands once a week since he works in remodeling and his finger nails look terrible so I give him a little manicure and I take this cuticle oil and massage into his nails and on his fingers and it’s so moisturizing and has a tiny bit on scent to it buts don’t let’s it’s cheapness fool you! One of the best nail products I’ve purchased so far 😍❤️
"
Kathryn Lucas,3.0,2022 29 June,"
This seems to do an adequate job of moisturizing but the glycerides impart a very soapy smell that reminds me of dish detergent. It's also a bit thin and runny. I prefer the CND Solar oil for smell and thickness of oil.
"
Nerisa Santos,5.0,2022 6 June,"
Menos de una gota es suficiente para hidratar cada dedo, la fragancia es muy agradable. Tiende a derramar un poco.
"
Cocoa W. 🤌🏾🤍,4.0,2022 7 January,"
Love it super moisturizing use for hands and feet  wish it was more scented but for people with clients  I'd say it's perfect cuz you never know how sensitive a person nose is
"
CAprincess,5.0,2022 25 May,"
True to size. Smells great. It does what its supposed to do. Love this stuff
"
Madison,4.0,2021 24 December,"
I have been using this product religiously for nearly two months now and i haven't really seen any good results. it does smell good and moisturize temporarily, on the bright side!
"
Al!xb,3.0,2022 27 January,"
I bought this to push back my cuticles because I recently got into doing my own nails.  The oil is just ok... I wouldn't say it's better or worse that any others you can buy at the drug store. I like that it has a very mild smell . It's oily not sticky, reminds me of hair oil treatment. I wish it was a brush on because you use up more product with the dropper. After the oil drys in like 20 minutes the cuticles go back to being ugly, maybe you have to do it on the regular for the best results ?
"
K. Hebrard,5.0,2022 17 May,"
Love the scent and very effective.
"
Vanesha Huddleston,5.0,2022 8 April,"
This cuticle oil is excellent and really moisturizes the cuticle well. Very easy to use. Would be from this brand again
"
Purerviolet,5.0,2021 18 June,"
It takes time but it really works. I bought this a month ago. I'm an elderly artist and my cuticles were ragged and dry. At first I didn't see much difference. Then I noticed my skin was peeling off around my cuticles. I almost stopped using it at that point but decided to continue. Now, a month later the peeling has stopped and my cuticles are looking smooth and shiny like never before. So, I started using on my toenails and dry flaky heels. Works there too. It's the combo of the ""milk"" or lactic acid for the peeling of dead skin cells and the ""honey"" which is the moisture.
"
Angela,5.0,2022 31 March,"
Its cuticle oil, it works like it is supposed to but I love the smell!
"
Jason Barnard Brown,3.0,2022 29 March,"
I'm willing to accept the possibility I simply used too much. But I've used other cuticle oils in the same proportions... And most eventually absorb into the skin. This one just sits... Like, until I have to wash it off bc I need me l my hands for something. Smells nice though.
"
Melba P.,5.0,2022 31 March,"
I enjoy that this product is so easy to use and effective.
"
TLynnBaby,5.0,2022 24 March,"
Seen a difference within a few days.Love,A nurse with dry cuticles
"
Rebecca Kwasnica,4.0,2021 30 June,"
It's very moisturizing and the scent is lovely and subtle. I only gave it four stars because I personally don't like the dropper, I'm a neat person and it makes the application a little too messy for me. I think I would prefer an oil with a brush next time, otherwise it's a nice cuticle oil!
"
Tuti V,5.0,2022 15 February,"
I find I dislike the smell of most cuticle oils but Milk and Honey smells amazing. Not overpowering and my skin felt a lot smoother after use.
"
Kindle Customer,5.0,2022 19 April,"
Does the job!!
"
Tina Ruschin,5.0,2022 26 January,"
This was by far a super purchase & value. Others with less oil are 2x the price for the same type of product doing the same thing just in fancier applicators
"
Brandi Gayle ❤,5.0,2020 31 October,"
This is amazing! I have very, very and extremely dry cuticles and this helped them the 1st day but using it 3 times a day for the last week, my cuticles and skin around the sides of my nails where ""I pick"" even have healed. This has been awesome and I'm so glad I discovered this! I have 2 bottles. I'm sure u can get results like me with one use a day. I also do acrylic and gel nails on myself and friends and I use this after I've completed a full set. My friends are even in love with this! Very easy to use! Moisturizes better than other brands and had a very nice scent!
"
bookwolffe,5.0,2022 17 February,"
I've only been using this about a week, so can't speak to it's effectiveness, but it smells and feels wonderful!
"
Starscream5000,5.0,2020 27 November,"
The pandemic has me stressed and I've started the nervous habit of picking at and peeling the skin beside my thumb nails and middle finger nails. After washing my hands multiple times and day and showering, the skin around those nails would become soft and pruny and, once it dried, would be hard like a callous. This started the cycle of me picking at the skin all over again. I bought this cuticle oil and the skin around my nails has improved sooooo much! It's much softer and peeling less so I find I'm not unconsciously picking at it as much as I used to be. This product definitely works!
"
Courtney O,5.0,2021 21 October,"
I have always had suuuuper dry and cracked cuticles. I work with my hands and I’m always embarrassed at how awful my cuticles looked. I pushed my cuticles back, removed them and put this on and my cuticles literally look perfect in ONE day… this might just be my miracle product lol
"
Lauren R.,3.0,2022 11 May,"
This stuff feels great at first, but disappears within minutes.
"
Kimberly,5.0,2022 2 January,"
The oil mixture is good. It moisturizes but my cuticles and hands very well. However the honey and milk scent is very light.  Other than that it’s a good product.
"
Maggie,5.0,2021 13 October,"
This is a great oil for cuticles, the best I've purchased so far. Been using it for about a week and I am starting to see improvement. I stays on for awhile which I like, where as others seem to evaporate. Will definitely again buy again. Great company!
"
JD,5.0,2020 24 October,"
First off, I paid for this product with my own funds. Second, I have never written a review for cuticle oil before...but, this oil is so fantastic that I felt compelled to share my opinion. This oil is the best cuticle oil I have ever used. I’m actually quite happy that I don’t have to keep searching for something that works. After using this oil there is a noticeable difference in not only the way my cuticles look but for how long they stay moisturized. I use about three times daily and the results have been wonderful. This will be my holy grail cuticle oil going forward.
"
Yudelka ,5.0,2022 19 March,"
i love it :)
"
Stacia,4.0,2020 17 January,"
I pick at my cuticles A LOT, and have recently made a conscious decision to stop. If my cuticles are at all dry, or a piece is starting to peel off, I HAVE to pick them! I bought this oil in the hopes that they will stay moisturized. I’d say they feel moisturized for about half an hour after I use the product. I have noticed some improvement though. The oil is nice bc it’s moisturizing, but my fingers don’t stay oily like they would if I used baby oil for example. There’s a VERY light smell, which is nice. Sometimes I don’t even smell it at all, which I think I prefer to an overpowering scent. For the price I think it’s a great product.
"
skatemom,5.0,2021 14 January,"
The scent is mild, which is nice.  It doesn't overwhelm you.  At first, I was a bit clumsy using the ""dropper,"" but with practice, I've gotten better.  And instead of worrying about a little oil getting everywhere, I just rub my hands with the excess.  Like lotions or oils, eventually it soaks in and so, isn't all over everything.  I really love the stuff.  And I think it's going to last me a really long time.  In fact, it may very well outlast ME, period!  :)
"
Kevonna Gardner,5.0,2021 15 June,"
I was kind of afraid to purchase this product, simply because I would normally have my cuticles and nails taken care of at the salon. However since I came home from base I really don’t like going to the salon like I used to, so I tried doing my own nails. Let me just say that I love the way this made my cuticles feel, after I had finished everything. I’m glad that I got a subscription.
"
Wanzi,4.0,2021 14 August,"
This product has really helped me get my hang nails under control. Provides a nice moisture.
"
Sydney,5.0,2021 23 June,"
This oil is for long-term use (there is a lot) and a little goes a long way! The smell is absolutely amazing! Sweet but not overwhelming. I have noticed a difference in my cuticles and they are much easier to maintain when I keep up with them. I also like to rub the oil into the dorsal part of my hands just as an extra touch of moisture. Highly recommend!
"
Stefani P.,4.0,2020 28 June,"
Beautiful bottle, lovely smell but not overpowering, and works great ~ makes your cuticles look and feel smooth, like a professional manicure. One bottle will almost literally last you forever because you need VERY LITTLE with each use. Just touching the tip of the applicator to your cuticle is all that's needed, then rub it in. A tad 'greasy' at first but absorbs quickly as you rub it in. Makes nails look finished, 'polished', professionally done. Would definitely buy again, and for gifting. Recommend!
"
Team Monke,3.0,2021 10 October,"
I really wanted to love this product.  I bought it based on the price point and also the reviews.  I have been using it for over a week, and am disappointed in the moisturizing of it.  I have to put this on multiple times a day to keep my cuticles moist.  The scent and ease of use is a plus, but this product does not do what it advertises.
"
Erin Lucero,4.0,2021 29 April,"
I see no difference in my cuticles, however any type of damage or irrigation I can simply put this miracle oil and by the evening or by the next morning its almost healed depending on the damage. Also the smells is amazing!!
"
Carter,5.0,2022 9 February,"
Great bottle and dropper. Has a nice scent.
"
F Pal,5.0,2022 14 February,"
Easy to use not too greasy
"
MO,5.0,2021 7 August,"
I felt compelled to write this review. I was skeptical at first, my cuticles were really bad and lotion barely helped. I started using this oil and within days I saw the difference-so did by nail stylist. It’s not overly oily and the scent is very light. I will buy again.
"
symone,5.0,2022 20 January,"
Great price for the amount and compared to other brands
"
A M C,2.0,2022 1 June,"
I bought this for my dry, cracking cuticles based on positive reviews. Unfortunately, it doesn’t moisturize my cuticles better than my hand lotion even when I apply and massage into my cuticles every time I wash my hands. I’ve used it for a week, so it was a fair trial in my opinion. Waste of money! I do not recommend this product.
"
Tricia B.,5.0,2021 9 November,"
I love the honey scent. It’s so subtle and smells just like honey. As for the nail oil action, it lasts for about 20 minutes.
"
NIKKI SLICKK ,5.0,2021 23 August,"
A little goes a long way! love the dropper in this! I use it on my elderly clients and I don't need much at all! the bottle lasts a while and smells nice. not super strong or overly perfumed. Will be ordering more!
"
Laura H.,4.0,2020 16 December,"
Overall this has been very helpful with my cuticles after using so much cleaning products and sanitizer at work and every day use after this crazy year 2020.  I felt it was a little slow to start really working but it did help restore and moisturize my fingers and cuticles.
"
Kanikki Callins,5.0,2022 3 February,"
Soft scent great moisture
"
K. Johnson,5.0,2020 7 December,"
I started doing my own nails at home and needed cuticle oil for my cuticles which are dry and brittle from washing dishes. This oil is very moisturizing  and makes my nails look great. I recommend this for anyone that want to care for their nails or who does their nails at home.
"
Sarah J,5.0,2021 1 July,"
I always get hangnails and broken skin around my fingertips. Everyone I know told me to drink more water and it would go away. But now that I have this, I just put some on, rub it in, and then put on hand cream, and my hands look so much better.
"
Jay V ,4.0,2021 28 May,"
I liked that it was moisturizing and easy to use. It had a little scent but not too much.

"
RST review,5.0,2020 5 June,"
Nicest nail oil I’ve ever owned. It works great. I use it at night for nails and toes. The scent is mild. After using the oil, I rub it into cuticles and then put lotion on my hands and feet. So the finished process smell is lotion. I’m not avoiding oil smell. It’s mild and doesn’t smell like much of anything to me.I did recommend this product to family and friends who are doing nails now at home. I may give this as stocking stuffer this year.
"
Hannah and Isaac Bocanegra,3.0,2022 12 January,"

amazonshopper115,5.0,2021 14 June,"
The scent is not super strong and a little goes a long way. I love this product and I’ve only used it once so far. I get my nails done professionally but I wanted to make the cuticle part last longer in between visits to the salon.
"
Tina Wise-Cook,5.0,2021 1 November,"
I love this cuticle oil it’s absolutely amazing. Leaves the cuticles nice and moisturized.
"
Ahop ,2.0,2022 2 March,"
The product has a ton of positive reviews, shocking to me!  If you have extremely dry, cracked, bleeding cuticles and need an oil that's going to help, this aint it!!!  My cuticles actually feel drier after using this.Do yourself a favor and just get pure Jojoba oil.The scent is nice, but not if its going to make my cuticles super dry.You've been warned!
"
sheshetta,5.0,2021 7 September,"
This cuticle oil is really good for your hands  it is not greasy. It makes a big difference with my cuticles.
"
star lopez,3.0,2021 10 August,"
It gets the job done. I like that it dries fast and doesn’t leave my hands feeling greasy for too long. The only problem with this is that it darkened my cuticles. Once I stopped using it, cuticles lighted up to their normal shade.
"

Lindsay,5.0,2021 10 July,"
My acrylics were pretty harsh on my nails and the skin around them, so i’ve been using this since taking them off. The scent is light and nice and it’s definitely moisturizing.
"
Anastasia B.,4.0,2020 7 June,"
Decent cuticle oil, overall. I was kind of hoping for more of the milk & honey scent, a little disappointing that you really don’t smell much of anything. But the product works fine to soften dry cuticles without being super greasy.
"
Christina’s Channel,5.0,2021 5 January,"
Smells great and feels soft on the skin like a serum would. I would definitely recommend! Turned my toes around quickly. I also placed some on my toes and put socks over my feet and slept in it. Woke up and they looked great! And it smells good!!!!
"

The Cuticle oil has a nice, not too strong scent. It’s very moisturizing and leaves my Cuticles feeling nice! The applicator is a dropper but it’s easy to use but be careful because you might put on a little too much oil on.

Some product had leaked in the package when I received it and I was annoyed and planned to return but I used it and I’m in love! Best cuticle oil I’ve ever used. Sucks that I only have like half what I ordered because of the leak.
"
Deborah Ryan,5.0,2020 22 July,"
I have always had ragged cuticles & tried soooo many creams & oils.I use on my finger & toe nails before bed. Lightweight so it soaks in without getting on my sheets.Got a mani-pedi today in record time, an hour, usually she spends 15 minutes on my fingernails alone.Try it, you won't regret it.
"
Ellie,5.0,2021 29 May,"

SurfCityGal,5.0,2021 30 April,"
Bought to include in my gel manicure regimen. This oil soothes as it soaks into your cuticles.
"
C.,1.0,2022 18 March,"
I bought this because my cuticles were really dry and at first it seemed to work alright. Temporarily, it made them feel  better. But after putting it on once a day for two months, my cuticles became the worst they've ever been. Dry and crusty and peeling everywhere, which they didn't do before. I thought that it was just my skin, until a friend gave me some Cuccio oil and I used it once or twice and my cuticles immediately looked and felt better. Then I used this one again and they started peeling again. So I don't know if it's some kind of reaction to the oil but my cuticles got worse with use, not better. Could just be me, but I wouldn't buy this again.
"
twihard73,5.0,2021 7 February,"
Its a good product but it could be better. It sits on your hands more than most.  After a few minutes I feel like I need to put more.
"

Very Moisturizing, nice and soft. However, there is absolutely no scent at all :(.

My cuticles very pretty bad as I do my nails my self with glue on nails and this cuticle oil works great ! I recommend
"
Jessica A,3.0,2021 21 April,"
This isn’t the most amazing cuticle oil I’ve ever used and in fact was surprised by how thin it was. I feel like thicker oils moisturize better and longer. This is fine what it is and will get the job done for my weekly self-manis.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 17 December,"
It really works!!! I have dry, hard, and ugly cuticles. I massaged the oil into my nail bed, and it moisturized my cuticles instantly. Now, I can’t stop looking at them.

It’s good.

Kelsey,5.0,2020 26 October,"

"
Debi Johnson,5.0,2020 18 October,"
I don't notice a scent. The moisturizing aspect is great because I'm a nurse and wash my hands constantly. Usually by now my cuticles would be bleeding but this has changed my life.
"
Ada Shorr,5.0,2020 31 May,"
I have had a problem with very rough cuticles for a number of years; this product has made that a memory of the past.  Since being unable to go to nail salon during the pandemic, it has been a great help!

NLB,5.0,2020 7 February,"
This is what my cuticles have been missing! I've tried many other oils and my cuticles would still be dry and noticeable. My manicure would look great but my cuticles...not so much. Now I apply this every day and the difference is amazing. Absorbs quickly and there isn't a strong odor.
"
Agnes Myer,4.0,2020 31 January,"
Love the smell of the oil. It's a thinner oil than I anticipated but it still makes the cuticle soft for awhile.

Love this cuticle oil! My cuticles get really dry in the winter. I started using this oil and within 3 days o have noticed a difference. I use it under a hand cream and night and keeps my cuticles soft.

Comes as shown! I think it’s great I use it on my clients they live it plus the scent. If you’re considering this product go for it!

The tip of the dropper was broken off when I received it.  It is glass, so now I'm afraid to use the dropper at all because there is a jagged edge where the tip should be.

Awesome

Harvey Brown,3.0,2021 31 January,"
The eye dropper applies too much when you use the eye dropper. Some others use a small brush which is easier to use and uses less per application.
"
Brenda Simpson,5.0,2021 13 May,"
Kept my nails very lubricant
"
DG,3.0,2020 13 October,"
The oil was messy to use and although I used a couple of times a day for 2 weeks I couldn't see an improvement.  I'm sure it works for some but not for me.
"
Karla Ramirez,5.0,2020 4 January,"
By far the best cuticle oil I've purchased. all oils that I've bought in the past are too sticky and very little product.  This small bottle goes a long way and smells so good. Will definitely be buying it again.

"
Zach n' Ashley,2.0,2020 29 June,"
I was hopeful to use this product, but this cuticle oil appears to do absolutely nothing.  I know that it is an “oil”, but a lot of cuticle oils aren’t super “oily”.  This one doesn’t absorb into my skin and my cuticles are just as dry as before I put on the oil and leaves my skin very greasy.
"
Sarah Koch,5.0,2020 29 January,"
Great product! Great price! My cuticles have never been better looking.
"
Amanda Jones,2.0,2020 22 November,"
I was really excited to try this but ended up pretty disappointed. It's really thin and really sticky but feels like it never absorbs into my skin. I used about half the bottle and never noticed any real improvement in now my cuticles looked or felt

"
J. Gagnon,2.0,2020 19 February,"
OK when I first applied but it dries up within minutesMy cuticles are still extremely dry and peeling.  I have applied it several times a day which is way more than the recommendation and it still doesn’t work

It doesn’t work very well it comes right off it’s too thin
"
mcmughk,1.0,2021 12 January,"
Just some type of oil.  Cannot be applied only to cuticle areas cos the oil is thin and will run over the whole fingers.  Do not feel nourishing the cuticle at all.  Using the argon oil that I have gives me the same result.
"
Broke college student,1.0,2020 3 September,"
I don’t know what’s in this cuticle oil, but the skin around my nails is worse after using it for a week then when I started. It’s hard and dry and peeling and cracking and I wish I’d never used it

"
Jackson,5.0,2021 27 April,"
I bought the ‘Milk & Honey’ as well as the ‘Lavender Tea Tree’ cuticle oils. I love that they are easy to apply and very moisturizing! A little goes a LONG way! The Milk & Honey smells really good. The Lavender Tea Tree smells good as well but it definitely has a stronger smell of lemon than Lavender. And the based off the name it says nothing about lemon, so a little misleading with that. But all in all, great products! Will buy again.
"
Carrie Moore,5.0,2020 24 May,"

"
douglas crespo,1.0,2020 2 October,"
Just rub vitamin E or olive oil all over your hands. Dont be fooled. Don't put some on your finger and rub in your cuticle. Just keep your hands moisturized and include the whole hand. Cant believe they sell this crap.
"
KentuckyMomma,4.0,2021 3 January,"
I love the smell of the Milk and Honey. It almost reminds me of baby lotion, but in a good way. It is super easy to use and a little goes a long way. I use it after I do a dip powder manicure and the skin around my nails and my cuticles gets pretty roughed up by all the buffing and filing.
"
Jada,5.0,2020 24 September,"
My cuticles were getting pretty dry recently and I couldn’t help but to pick at them. They looked awful. Probably the worst they have ever been. But thanks to this oil my cuticles are A LOT better. I applied it every time my cuticles were looking dry. Approximately twice a day at first. Now I only do about twice a week and they’re still going strong. This is also my natural nail. Highly recommended.
"
Tair Y,4.0,2020 10 August,"
I was looking for something with more of a scent, I didn’t get that. However the product is good! I would order again if I didn’t something with more of a scent. :)

"
Andrea,5.0,2020 31 July,"
This cuticle oil revived my cuticles, nail, and skin around my nails. After the first use, I could immediately notice the improvement. For best results, apply the oil a few minutes after you get out of the shower! Your skin will absorb it quickly and effectively. Your cuticles WILL thank you!
"
Peggy,2.0,2020 11 December,"
It’s too watery. I’ve never used cuticle oil that’s like this. You put it on then it just drips down your fingers before you can run it in. I do NOT recommend.

"
AK,1.0,2021 9 January,"
The bottle is cute and the oil is... fine, but the main issue is the smell. Think less ""Milk & Honey"" and more of a powerful, fake ""Candy"" smell. This was a waste of money for me.

"
Luka Legend,1.0,2021 13 December,"
My cuticles didn’t stop being dry, which was the entire point for me. The oil is really greasy and doesn’t absorb quickly, meaning it gets all over my finger pads and requires more than a quick pass with a tissue or paper towel to get off. Finally, the smell is artificial and too strong - smells like purfume, not a pleasant hint of an aroma.

Great product I soak my cuticles before ripping them off. I get very large and thick cuticles and this definitely makes the process much easier. No real scent but there again I can’t smell well. Happy with the product and price.

"
Maylin Williams,5.0,2021 17 August,"
I had a really bad habit of picking at my fingers. I would pick them so bad to where they would bleed. The problem for me was my cuticles were so dry that they would tempt me to pick them all the time. I started using this oil a few times a day and my fingers not only look so much better, I stopped picking at them! It also smells super good. 10/10 recommend if you have this issue.

I loved the packaging, the bottle, the scent, and the ease of use. I’m disappointed that the moisture evaporates so quickly though. I’ll rub this into my nails at bedtime, and within 10 minutes, you can’t tell I put anything on them. I had expected the oil to work throughout the night as I slept, but this isn’t it.

Alberto,5.0,2022 29 August,"
I have been collecting Lego for a while, but hadnt really jumped into tecnic sets. This set is probably the best to get the most of the tecnic experience: the gears, struts, and all other moving components. This set offers a glimpse into the basic function of differentials, gear boxes, 4x4, power transfer, etc.The final product boasts a 4 speed sequential gear-box with a rotary shifter, a DNR shifter, and a Hi-Lo 4-wheel drive shifter, all functional and all on the center console. All 4 wheels obviosuly rotate and are mounted on individual suspension systems. The drive shaft connects to a crude in-line v6 ""engine"" thats made to look like moving pistons. Lego has pieces to make a very nice v6 engine that could potentially fit in this set. This wouldve been absolutely perfect if it came with that engine, but all the other features more than make up for it.I dont care much for the vehicle model, especially because lego are extremely customizable, but the chassis of the model is well worth the price because it has almost everything to make an accurate and functional lego vehicle. I must point out that Tecnic pieces are not great for accurately depicting contours. You will always have gaps on the model. So tecnic is great for depicting functions more than depicting reality and aesthetics. The set does look nice enough for display, but I like it more for play and learning/teaching.I havent gotten around customizing mine yet, but I absolutely want to turn this to RC soon. I know the drive shaft will require some design changes, but the rest of the mechanical parts should work fine
"
WoofWoof,5.0,2022 11 September,"
One of my favorite builds to date although there were moments I wanted to smash it ;)  pay very close attention to the gears. There are many.  I recommend watching the videos for this one by Racingbrick on YouTube. He shows you what to test at each stage of the build as well as common errors. Of course I didn’t have that advice before I built this.  When it was done I found that it wouldn’t roll without a painful grinding sound.  This was because I used the wrong gear in one step. I ended up having  to tear it down and almost start over because of the gear error.  So pay attention. In the end it’s very satisfying and I highly recommend it.
"
PhotoGuyReview,5.0,2022 8 October,"
It’s a great set…I can’t wait to start building this soon to be classic Lego technic set.
"
Oluwatobi,5.0,2022 23 August,"
I gave my 7 Yr old son this as a gift for his 7th birthday after he has successfully completed several Lego Technic models within his age range. He has never Gone beyond 1000+ pcs so we watched online and he got really scared watching an adult build it. When he gathered the courage to start, i was astonished he got it all up within 2 weeks. Now i am searching for a more complex Lego Technic of 9-14 that will be more challenging that the defeder for him. This is a very good buy for its price and the value.
"
Evelyn Celentano,5.0,2022 24 September,"
It was a gift for my son, I’m sure he is going to enjoy building it.
"
Robertson 23,5.0,2022 23 August,"
First let me say I love Lego’s. That being said this was a really fun build for me. I love all the moving parts and the details of the build. The only thing I wish they would have done was to add motors. I know that would have upped the price but I think it would have been worth it.
"
Tani,5.0,2022 16 September,"
My son loves it. Great purchase
"
Moira S.,5.0,2022 14 June,"
My son is a lego maniac! He is OBSESSED. I think he is most excited about the tires on this Jeep. This is his most recent set and let me tell you, he underestimated how many pieces it would have. My kitchen table is hidden under them all until he puts it together and he gets distracted, AH-LOT. Did I mention we have 4 cats??? Can't wait to see how this turns out. Hopefully it will not include a vet bill too.
"

"
Matthew,5.0,2022 7 August,"
It's a fun complicated build, took about 16 hours.
"
Denise,5.0,2022 30 June,"
This is a complex kit, but if you follow the directions (which aren’t always clear) and make sure you use the correct parts ( some a very similar), you will enjoy the time spent and end up with a nice finished product!. I do not recommend it for a beginner, though.
"
Pabloco,5.0,2022 3 June,"
I was looking for a challenging Lego build, and the Land Rover Defender did not disappoint. Its complex gearing was and remains very impressive. It’s a show-piece for sure with loads of movable parts. It has a high play-ability factor too, should I decide to let my daughter play with it. 😉 It’s proving difficult to find my next Technic build after such a great experience with this kit. Super price too.
"
Justin Brought,5.0,2022 27 July,"

I bought it for my birthday wish and it was WORTH IT.  I haven’t built Lego for a long time.  I really enjoyed to build Lego Land Rover and it took me to complete for two days.  I really love it!

Tony Piroli,4.0,2022 9 March,"
Well this is one BIG and I do mean BIG lego set and for those who are looking for alot of gears to sync up this is your baby!!!!!  I do enjoy doing LEGO even at 65 I can still enjoy the challenge of attention to detail and what it takes to assemble this project.  Al ot will say the price is high but the amount of time it will take you and just the fun of it is well worth it......

Large manual and the build was very intuitive.

James,5.0,2022 16 June,"
Great value and it's very fun to assemble this land rover. It takes me 2 days and commit many hours to finish it. Its size is bigger compare to other lego technic and compose of many features.

Joyce Lee,5.0,2021 14 March,"
I’m a huge Lego fan and this set is exactly what I was looking for – hard enough but not too complex, so that I won’t end up messing everything up. I chose this one because of its cool looking, fancy functional features, and most importantly – it’s big enough so I won’t finish it in just one day!All the details specified on the box are real and well functioned, I especially love the gear shift and the hi/lo settings, also the lock door on the back. The real thing looks nothing different from on the box. I was pretty satisfied.If you’re buying this set or if you’re about to build it, I do have a suggestion for you – for every 4 or 5 pages, check if your project is what’s on the book. Especially for bag 1 and 2 when building the engine part, you need to make sure they’re working correctly and smoothly. Unfortunately, it is sometimes hard to tell which gear is which from the book – unlike the bars, there aren’t scales so you can’t know the size, and the colors look almost the same. As a 19-year-old, I still made not only one but a few mistakes during the process, and one fatal that caused my car to not be working correctly. I messed the little gears up, so that’s why I say those are tricky.Overall, I’d definitely recommend this set to all Lego and car lovers! It’s worth it!

C. Gollnick,5.0,2022 8 March,"
Given as a gift to my nephew who is an accomplished and experienced Lego builder.  He declared this the most challenging and most fulfilling set he’s ever done.  And that made it especially enjoyable for him.The set I received was absolutely new.  My nephew reported no missing pieces.  The box was in perfect condition… which is important to Lego enthusiasts.  It came in a tight outer box which was then inside of a shipping box, very well-protected.The only problem is how to top this one.

Matt,5.0,2022 29 June,"
Exactly as expected, looks great when assembled

Marie T,5.0,2022 14 February,"
This was by far the most tedious, brain-scrambling Lego build we’ve done so far. My son is 10 and he tackled this by himself. He got maybe a quarter of the way through and messed something up so we took it all apart and started over again.We finally got it rebuilt and it’s really cool. We bought a light kit from The Kyglaring Store here on Amazon. It’s absolutely amazing makes this build even better.Be prepared to lose your mind a little in this one but it’s so worth it.

Saugar,5.0,2020 10 May,"
This was a very fun build — took about 8 hours of total time spread out over several days. The bags are numbered which made working through the set more organized. The functional features are really cool, such as the working gear box, hi/lo settings, drive and reverse lever, working winch, and functional tailgate. The parts are high quality, including the suspension which is quite rugged.There are multiple parts of this build that require a high degree of attention to detail which may be challenging for younger kids. This is officially an 11+ set, but my guess is it would be quite hard of a build for anyone under 16, especially if the challenge is to build it and have all of its functions actually work.As an adult, I still made several mistakes that required me to disassemble some built components to correct. The instructions made it quite clear that certain parts need to be aligned perfectly for the gearbox to work and for the steering to be aligned. I ended up needing to fine tune the gears that controlled the steering as my steering wheel was not aligned to the rotation of the wheels. Sort of like a real Land Rover!Contrary to other reviews, I had no missing pieces.
"
Catraflyr,5.0,2022 14 March,"
Owning a LR and being a lifelong Technic addict, I can say building this kit was a true LR experience, paying close attention to the instructions and details pays off in the end. Excellent for bonding with the next generation and passing down the LR passion and Technic spirit.
"
Jeffrey L Till,5.0,2020 2 April,"
the incredibly detailed Lego Land Rover defender was very fun to build I found it a little hard toward the end of bag 2 when I had to put the to ends of the inner part of the car together. after you've put the wheels on the car it brings the whole thing together. I like how the engine under the hood looks really realistic (putting aside the fact that you wouldn't be able to see the cylinders on a regular car). I wish the inside of the car looked a little less open and techy, but it doesn't really matter. I love how the gearbox really works when you change the shifters. after the 6 hour build, I felt a little disappointed that I was finished because I couldn't build more but I guess that's the falling I always get when finished with a lego. the back door lock does not want to stay locked and closed. I loved this lego a bunch. I was inspired to buy this lego after building the 42096 Porsche 911 racecar. it is very fulfilling. a super awesome design I think you should get it.

Absolutely loved assembling this kit. Highly recommend for anyone interested in burning some time during the winter months
"
Keisher P.,5.0,2021 20 September,"
My 9 year old son put this lego set together in 2 1/2 days. He messed up on step 271 because 2 pieces looked identical. He had to disassemble some parts. So, instead of using the booklet to follow instructions he scanned the QR code, downloaded the lego app and followed instructions from there. Because he was able to zoom in on the lego pieces, it made building this very intricate lego set easier.It was not to complicated because he has experience with building lego sets. Overall, It was a fun and amazing experience for my son! He was so proud of the finished product!
"
Michael Correia,5.0,2021 16 September,"
I love this model I built it off and on for about 7 hrs  Go slow and you won’t have hearing problems like some are saying in reviews. Very sturdy only the top roof container comes off during rollovers and you can drop it from about 3 feet and it’ll be fine. Very accurate to the real thing one of the best car models you can get for your money. None of the akward looking holes that some sets (Bugatti) have very natural looking. Can get dirty but as always be careful. Not for kids under 14 needs patience to complete right.
"
BizzyC,5.0,2022 24 January,"
I purchased this for my college age kids and i to build over the holidays.  It had been years since we worked on Legos together and we had a blast.  I was blown away at the quality of this build.  It's a fantastic piece!
"
Sam Kingsley,5.0,2020 8 April,"
I really love Lego that is both fun to build and can be displayed afterward - this one definitely hits both. I'm not the biggest fan of Technic, I prefer the original style of Lego but this was still great.Perfect to work on a bit each night after work and dinner and a really nice way to wind down. The internal functionality of it all was incredible and a lot of fun to see it come together. It was considerably larger than I imagined but that's my fault for not reading the specifications more closely.Once finished it looks awesome on my bookshelf!Tips:- Tweezers really help with sticker application- Pay attention to the color and size of pieces I had a few instances where I used the wrong piece and had to go back a few steps- If it feels like something isn't lining up then you have probably gone wrong somewhere, read back into the book and figure it out methodically
"
Kristin,5.0,2022 4 February,"
We loved putting this together. It took a couple of days. Some of the instructions were difficult to interpret, but we were able to solve them by trial and error.The sturdiness of the Land Rover is amazing!
"
Andres,5.0,2022 8 January,"
This is probably the set that give you most for its value. a beautiful design with so many parts at a great price!Some other car sets are much more expensive and don't give you as many parts or functions. Probably one of the best technic sets ever!

Alan haines,5.0,2021 21 October,"
This was a truly enjoyable build. I was a little confused when I built the transmission, and it didn't shift as easily as I expected it to. After I tore it down I realized I had just started with the wrong gear. After that it was a very smooth straight forward build. My son-in-law was shocked at the level of detail, and the suspension.
"
Jazzie,5.0,2022 11 February,"
Bought this for my adult son with decades worth of Lego experience.  He absolutely loves it and has it displayed as artwork.
"
Brandon,5.0,2021 20 April,"
This is the best lego set I have ever seen. It's big, fun to build, and takes quite a while.The mechanics are really neat, although it bugs me that the transmission gears go high to low instead of low to high - probably a gimmicky thing to make it seem like the engine is doing more as you accelerate through the gears, but yeah they have it backwards.The winch is super cool, the truck's look is perfect, and there are a bunch of new parts I haven't seen before. The way it's designed is very sturdy and efficient. Technic sets have come a long way.
"
Kathleen Atkinson,5.0,2020 26 October,"
My 17 year old son loves to put together Legos and has since he's been 5 - we have about 65 different Lego kits that he's put together over the years. Unfortunately, it's hard to find kits nowadays that are challenging enough for the older ones to put together.  When we saw this one, we knew we had to get it even though the price point was more than we wanted to spend.  It ended up being money well spent since it took him two full days to put together and the details that go into the truck are absolutely amazing and realistic.  It's on display in our family room and my son shows it off to everyone that comes over.
"
Carlos,5.0,2022 29 March,
Willy Dibler,5.0,2021 28 March,"
Ok, first off i would like to say that IMO there is no point in the transmissions they give these models. i spin a wheel to see the ""engine"" move and it barely moves because the gearing is so high. rolling it doesn't help. yes i am 41 years of age but Lego has always been my go to when i want to release my mind. works for days or even weeks on end lol and to be honest i bought this model for parts only. i am not a collector, i am a builder and i have things in mind for this set...
"
sean evans,5.0,2022 9 January,"
Definitely not a build for the novice. Once completed it's an awsome piece to display! Being able to see all the gears working, an actual working suspension grabs people's attention.
"
William A. Van Gorden,5.0,2021 8 March,"
I've bottle built a lot of lego sets in the past. This is one of the best auto reproductions they've offered. The hardest and most intricate set I've ever done. If you make the smallest mistake, you're looking at some heart break. You'll have to undo a great deal to fix it. If you want an addition to your Lego garage, you've got to include it. The price is excessive and I imagine it has to do with marketing agreements and not entertainment value. You may have to save up to get it and though the product is fantastic, it bursts your wallet.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 9 January,"
The build was awesome. It’s meant to be a display piece in my opinion - cannot really play without parts falling. But the final word is - AWESOME!
"
Esther lee,5.0,2022 21 February,"
A fun building set... Looking forward to motorized it
"
Julie Tran,4.0,2021 16 March,"
My son spent a lot of time building this.  He was really excited afterwards to play with it. But after one day, a clicking sounded started happening when it was in the gear ""drive"".  We searched all over the internet for solutions.  None of them were helpful to us.  Furthermore, it seemed as though this is a common occurrence with this model.  My son is a HUGE Lego fan, so he still really likes it, but is very disappointed that he can't use the different gears without it making this clicking noise.

"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 22 March,"
The box is huge and so is the finished product. Took a good while to build, as one would expect, this one significantly more difficult than say the VW Van or VW Surf Buggy, but looks awesome. Be very careful on which gears you're using when building the engine/transmission as 1 mistake will call for a full rebuild. You know what this product is, nad you know it's quality control is excellent. Buy this, you won't be disappointed.
"
Matt O.,5.0,2021 3 August,"
With other equally complex sets in the $350+ range, this has to be the best value for the money in a Lego Technic set. Its packed with intricate and authentic details and super high quality. Challenging, but an exciting build and unbeatable at $159 for any Lego enthusiast!
"
Nick M. Atalla,5.0,2020 1 July,"
I really enjoyed building this (I'm a retired engineer) and was somewhat sad to finish. Very detailed and functional - not your usual lego set. Many custom pieces which may be a little different from what you're used to with lego, but very enjoyable building. My son and his family have also build similar models during our Covid quarantine. My granddaughter, 7 years old, has proven to be one heck of an builder and probably could have build this one (she is very detailed oriented and pays attention :)
"
Rapheal C.,5.0,2022 10 January,"
Great product great build
"
A. Farfan,4.0,2020 8 May,"
I like the attention to detail. I don’t like the transmission it doesn’t seem to work right when selecting different gears. Also car is not level (back heavy) and the weight creates flat spots on soft tires. This also happened with my new bat mobile from Lego. Lego needs to use thicker sturdier tires for these heavy sets. But overall one of the nicest exterior finishes from technic. It actually looks like a Range Rover n not one of the older technic models that barely have a body on them.
"
Dinesh Garg,3.0,2021 2 July,"
My 5 years old loves building Lego technic models. He wanted to learn how does 4x4 drive works. So we got him Land Rover. It took him 2 weeks to assemble. Once built, as soon as he tried to play with that, pieces started coming from different place. Most notably the back door which comes out all the time.Then he tried to see how does gears work i.e. Hi/Lo/R/N...These look like show pieces only. Even if you keep gear in R, Land Rover will go forward. Also, 4x4 drive is for namesake. When u drive front wheels, engine pistons do not move.This design totally failed on functionalities/expectation.
"
Scott G.,5.0,2020 31 December,"
I bought this for my grandson of seven who with his dad's help assembled the Technic Land Rover Lego.  I saw the finished result at Thanksgiving and it's the real deal!  Amazing what Lego has done with the Technic line.  Now my son wants me to select one so he and his son can build it for me.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 7 August,"
What exited him is a  nice details of car, such as (be aware of spoiler):- gear  that shifting and works properly.- wheels control from the roof- backdoor with possibility open turning a wheel- all those things which are well done, and very likely many other details which I have missed,Nothing was missing or incorrect in the package.4 days of enjoyable building.
"
BallaghMan,3.0,2021 16 May,"
This is an ambitious undertaking for anyone not used to building complex lego models - me!  It’s incredibly intricate, the directions while thorough are not the clearest at times, and unfortunately my set was missing a few key pieces along the way (one can only wonder at the quality control involved in packing these sets).  I also made one or two mistakes assembling the engine gearing which I didn’t realize until way too late.  I was NOT about to disassemble!  Ultimately it was fun in terms of passing several hours of lockdown time over about ten days, but I’d caution novices to start with something a bit easier first (as I should have).
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 30 November,"
Frustration free packaging is them just slapping a shipping label on the LEGO set box which isn’t ideal as a collector or if your deliveries are visible to anyone walking by.Other than that this set is gorgeous and a fun and technical build. There’s a little sadness when you realize there’s only one bag left.
"
EngineerJon,5.0,2021 25 January,"
One of the most fun Lego sets out there. My son is 10 years old and it took him about 8 hours to complete the build. we did experience issues with the engine pistons making a clicking noise as others have mentioned, there is a simple fix on YouTube for it.

"
Maureen H,5.0,2021 12 June,"
Legos are always pricey, this one is as well, but very fun and simple to assemble, took about a day to build 2,000+ pieces but assembly smooth like butter, fun features, and a good set overall
"
AMM,5.0,2021 26 February,"
Like most LEGO sets, this is not cheap, but it is worth the price relatively speaking. It was a challenging but not frustrating and fun build for my “Expert” son. It is sturdy enough for play, not just display. Technic line is new favorite. Definitely recommend!
"
Yang,5.0,2021 16 January,"
I normally purchase set on LEGO.com, but when I purchased this set, there's a very good coupon on amazon, so I purchased it here, I finished it in 10 days, the building experience is very good, when I finished it, it has a really good look too, I would recommend it.

"
pdx,5.0,2020 1 January,"
I couldn't be ny happier with this kit.  The level of engineering is completely over the top!  Every time I thought a part was missing I eventually found it.  My fingers are numb to the core but the comleted Land Rover Defender made it all worth it.  The funny part is that the build quality of this Lego toy is probably better than that of a real Land Rover.  :)
"
take time t. . .,5.0,2021 23 January,"
LEGO has done it once again with this model.  PERFECT DIRECTIONS. Such complex, intricate parts.  Super cool, fun build.  It's not cheap but it's totally worth it.  I almost want to buy another one just to build it again!

Constantine Maniakas,5.0,2019 2 December,"
Absolutely an awesome model to build. Every step was easy to execute but...and it’s a big butt...I found that I needed to order missing pieces...twice! I’ve never run into this kind of problem with other models. It was disappointing to have to wait for parts,  but it did allow me to take a break from the fantastic build. I gave it five stars just because it’s a great LEGO set to assemble.
"
dstarr,5.0,2021 24 January,"
This model is fun to build and educational.  The steering, suspension and gearbox all work.  It includes doors and tailgate that open. and a working winch.  It's very clever.  Instructions are very clear.
"
Chuch76,5.0,2021 26 March,"
I absolutely loved this build. 2 late nights with my wife to finish but we’re not pros, plus the wine factor.. Love the attention to detail with the suspension on this model
"
Nick Blake,5.0,2019 13 December,"
Overall it looks great and was great fun to build. However once done I can't get the front wheels to both move in the forward direction. One goes back while the other forward making the tires pop off. I am hesitant to take it apart because I literally would have to take it all apart and rebuild it piece by piece because I don't know where I went wrong.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2020 1 July,"
I just want you to update the real value for the weight, I got the package and the box real weight was 8 pounds, on the product information says 2.2 pounds.This information is important for future purchases.Thanks

PNWOwen,5.0,2020 29 April,"
Good lego product, assembly is tedious, taking a few days.I did think it was missing parts, and one of the wheels did not turn, but when we did an audit, we discovered we had made errors in installation. I think its highly unlikely that there are ever any missing parts, but more likely it builders error.
"
Bryan Watson,5.0,2020 3 February,"
I obviously comes with instructions, but is an advanced build. There is no room for error in this build. If you overlook a step or misplace a piece it may screw the whole build up. However, I really enjoyed building with my son. I will be looking for a new project to work on with him soon. He loves the winch feature.
"

This was a great build. I loved the gears interaction.
"
Kendall Jones,5.0,2019 23 December,"
It is a really sharp looking set, and faithful to the original design.  I felt like compared to other technic legos we have completed it was not quite as sturdy.  It is made to be more dynamic with shocks and has a great suspension.  That may be the trade off for such a capability. I definitely recommend the set for any Lego Technic fan.
"
Gustavo Villalobos,5.0,2021 21 May,"
Definitely one of the most complete, didactic and realistic LEGOs I've ever owned. The details from the engine, transmission and differentials are outstanding.

johnnycnc,2.0,2021 28 August,"
This should be a wonderful journey to conduct such a great scale model vehicle but LEGO seemed to put a wrong piece of parts (see first 2 snapshots) into the package when I finished over 90% of the assembly. Altough I could still put them together but the imperfection really hurt my feelings by spending 3 days hard work. I don't think that supplier will replace the package for me and I don't want to do the assembly again, either. I just want to wish other purchaser luck not to encounter the same situation like mine. And wish LEGO can further improve their QC process.

Rafael,3.0,2020 22 August,"
Please research this set prior to starting the assembly process, there is a glaring mistake in the assembly instructions that will result in performance issues, i.e. the vehicle will make a clicking noise and the wheels will not rotate as intended.With that said: this is a great looking set and wonderful value for the money - but, surely, that's a claim that is both subjective and relative - and that's my two cents.

Nomad,1.0,2020 10 November,"
While this is an amazing set from what I can tell, my set was missing so many pieces that I cannot finish building it.Specifically, in section 4 out of 4 of this build, I noticed the first missing piece. I ordered it in the mail from another supplier. Once it arrived, I noticed a few steps later another piece was missing. Over the course of the next 20 steps, there were 14 pieces missing. I stopped counting after that.Several other reviews stated there were missing pieces. I ignored these reviews, assuming the owners just misplaced pieces, and now I regret it. I was very organized while assembling and am completely confident the error is not mine.I absolutely do not recommend this set.

Ok it’s a awesome build but missing to many pieces 👎🏻 Was so disappointed when I realized it was missing pieces and 4 Pcs in the 2 nd part alone. I have plenty of spare legos so I could continue but I can a lot of other people not having them. So buyer beware.

J. Taylor,1.0,2020 13 May,"
Long time Lego Technic / Creator builder here. I heard from a couple friends that this build while cool is notorious for missing pieces (as you can see from some other reviews). I figured they were outliers and bought it anyways. Got all the way to page 19 or so before a missing piece stopped me (in my case a piece relating to the wheel joint). Now at least a 2-week wait and likely more. I don't know if it was just a bad lot with poor quality control that Amazon got, but it's extremely frustrating.

Jennifer,1.0,2020 2 December,"
I don’t want to open the box because it’s a Christmas present, but the condition of the box is terrible. Based on the packaging, it looks like I bought a used product, which I definitely didn’t want to do, and really didn’t expect—especially based on the price.  I’m worried that all of the pieces won’t be inside. Not even sure how to check, unless I put the whole thing together. Definitely disappointed.
"
Bongo,5.0,2022 4 July,"
This is another Lego model that will make you completely forget you spent $200.  The main reason being the multiple ways to customize for staging.  With customizable roof rack pieces, multiple opening door/lids and suspension movement you can really make it look different each day.  Plus, the fact is it just looks big and cool.  Assembly was relatively easy with only a small list of confusing manual pages.

Tara Genovese,1.0,2021 27 February,"
This is the second time my son has been midway through his build and found defects in the product. The first time two pieces were missing from the bags, unique pieces that we didn’t have spare or could skip. No we find this piece which is a defect from the factory. Once again Amazon solution is to send entire kit back and rebuild it....🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

Gidget86,1.0,2019 26 December,"
We have spent 12 hours on this to find that the last 2 bags have missing pieces.For $200 their should be a better way to make sure all pieces are there before people put hours into building and now have to stop and wait for a solution. Annoying more than anything.
"
Andrew P.,5.0,2019 17 October,"
The Technic Land Rover Defender comes in an impressively large box where the offroad vehicle practically leaps off the front. The value is excellent with over 2,500 pieces easily meeting the $0.10 per piece target builders often use as a comparison point. Upon opening the box, a variety of bags tumble out along with an inner white box which helps give the outer box some reinforcement. More bags and an extremely thick instruction manual lie within the inner box.The bags are sorted into four groups along with a single bag of large rims and tire hubs. The first group is the rear chassis and gear assembly, the second is the front and joins together with the first to essentially complete the inner workings of the car, the third is the rear outer casing, and the fourth group completes the picture with the front of the car and the roof rack. With only four groups of bags, it's a good idea to open a set when you plan to sit down and build a while, or in a place where you can leave pieces out as you build.The first and second bags are easily the more challenging portions of the build. The gear system is remarkably detailed and complicated. I paid extremely close attention the whole way through and took breaks any time I felt myself becoming distracted. The manual is laid out in very easy to follow steps and no steps includes more than a handful of parts to add. Even so, there were moments I found myself studying very carefully indeed to feel confident of what went where. There is a QR code for the page where the front and rear chassis are connected which led to an interesting short video showing the connection. Wonderful idea, but a particular movement the demonstrator made with a gear that is at the end of an axle and then slides backwards as the sections connect actually confused me more than just reading the printed page. All worked out in the end though and love the addition of a video to help out.The third and fourth sections of the car went rapidly and were quite relaxing after the study of the first half. I tested the steering as I went and the doors but left the full test of the gearbox until the end. Risky if something was wrong but it was exciting to wonder how well it was going to work.One hiccup was two nine-page sections of the instruction manual were printed twice and two same-sized sections were missing. I've not had this happen with LEGO before. Happily it was extremely easy to access the PDF online and my building was not interrupted.The finished result is fantastic. The plating covers up some of the incredible detail of the first half of the build but looking through the body and under the hood makes the complexity plenty visible. As for the gears, I felt I mostly got it right: only on one of the many settings did I have any cracking sounds and the others ran smoothly. Completed, the Land Rover is prime LEGO eye candy, no two ways about it. Thoroughly enjoyed this build and if you are up for a good Technic challenge, this should be right in your wheelhouse.

"
Shelley,4.0,2019 11 November,"
This set is fantastic. The finished vehicle is very large and has so many moving parts it's hard to keep track of it all. It took me somewhere around 10 hours to completely assemble this, and I am an adult builder with many years of LEGO experience. If you are ordering this for a small child, I would strongly recommend planning on helping out with the entire build. I could see many young children having a hard time with this build as there are so many steps and tiny pieces to keep track of.This vehicle has forward, neutral, and reverse gears, steerable front wheels, a four speed transmission, plus high and low gears, 4 wheel independent suspension, etc. There is a lot going on ""under the hood"" of this set.With over 2500 pieces in this set, I guess it's not totally surprising that it was missing a piece. It had extras of other pieces, but not the piece that I needed. Yes, I searched the floors of my work area before docking a star off of the review, but alas, the piece is nowhere to be found and I can only assume that my set was missing this one piece (see photo for the piece that is missing). Aside from the singular missing component, everything needed was included in the box.The manual included with this is something like 500 pages long, so you can see that it is not for the faint of heart. After all is said and done, this is by far the most advanced LEGO set I have ever built, but what a blast it was building it. This would be a great parent and child project, but if you just set your 5 year old loose on this set I wouldn't expect to have the best of results.

J1976,5.0,2019 16 December,"
I think my 5-year-old son and I have been working on this for a good 1.5 months now. It's going slower than I had anticipated but I'm OK with that because I get to spend more quality time with my son, and because it's great learning tool for him-—his math and counting skills have improved, he has to visual pieces in 3D space, and he has to troubleshoot when things go awry.The LEGO instructions are hands down the best instructions I have ever seen and I guess this is why I was initially frustrated with how slowly our build is going. We also have a three-year-old Godzilla running around our house who likes to smash what we have built so that hasn't helped us. However, we have turned this into a learning experience for our 5-year-old. When stuff gets knocked apart we sit down and put our thinking caps on—I tell my son we are the repair crew in charge of fixing everything. First, we try and figure out what pieces we already have together by comparing the part we are working on to what is in the manual, and then we look for what's missing—what color is the piece we need, what shape is it, and if its a brick how many units wide and long is it, and then finally how do we put everything back together? I LOVE when my son says ""Ah, I get it!"".When I was younger my brothers and I had buckets and buckets of LEGOS that we played with endlessly. I think next to Matchbox cars LEGOs are really the only toy that I vividly remember playing with. Our mom would take us to K-Mart every year to see the giant LEGO creations they had on display at the entrance and we would get so excited.One day we will get this build completed and finally post our picture!By the way, do yourself a favor and download the ""Lego Life"" app for your phone. As soon as you open your LEGO set scan the QR code in the manual and add the set to your library. This way when the instruction book gets shredded or lost like ours always do you will have it on your phone.

 I’m going to say right off that I’m a huge LEGO fan. I’ve been one for 20 years and I’m most likely going to be one for the next 20 if my luck holds. I’ve built with generic LEGO blocks and I’ve built in their themed sets such as Star Wars and Harry Potter. Their Architecture sets and City builds are some of my favorites but this Land Rover build in their Technic series tops them all. The level of detail is astounding. I have one niggle as I always do but otherwise this review is positive...please get rid of the stickers! Honestly, a handful of branded pieces can’t be that hard. Ok...on to the build review.This is a challenging set. The beginning age range of 11 years old is going to need a little help. A 13 year old could probably swing it but it’s still going to be building on a minute detail scale. The parts bags are a bit jumbled so you’ll need to open all the little bags inside the larger bags at the start of each section. The bags are labeled in build sections 1 through 4. Inside those bags are even more bags of tiny parts and you’ll need some from each from the start. This means opening 4 to 6 large bags of parts plus 3 or more tiny bags PER section. I used plastic bowls for the smaller parts and plastic plates for the larger ones. This helped keep things sorted. I’d recommend only opening one sections components at a time.The manual is huge and at points it’s clear...as mud! The work around is the app! Install it on your tablet or PC, scan the QR code and download your manual. Being able to zoom it in and out is a game changer and a huge improvement on the folded over pages that never stay flat enough to read. How many times has the manual swept parts off the table during your builds?  Or is that just me? Anyway, the app is a win win!As the build progresses and you realize you’re being taken through the building of a Land Rover from the engine and drive shaft all the way out to the roof rack and tires...the scale begins to dawn on you. From the working pistons to the coiled spring shocks , the detail and commitment to design is apparent. One of my favorite components outside of the intricately built front wheel drive is the large scale real rubber tires. This set is quality through and through.If you are a Land Rover enthusiast, an automobile buff or just a huge LEGO fan, don’t pass this one up. This isn’t style over substance folks, this is model building with LEGO at the top of their craft!

Tiger,5.0,2019 29 October,"
It's always an AWESOME day when there's a big box of LEGO waiting for me!  The box has great images of the set and has the Land Rover displayed against a rocky background, which is perfect.  Box opened, here's what we have: a bunch of bags of LEGO, manual, sticker sheet, and 5 ginormous tires!  This set is really cool and a lot of fun to build.  My husband was really into LEGO vehicles when he was a kid, so he's building this one first.  Once he's done, we'll tear it apart and I'll build it again.The set contains a hefty instruction manual in a single volume that measures nearly three quarters of an inch thick - close to 500 pages! The first 2 pages of the instruction manual have information about how to get the LEGO Life app and how to make sure you're choosing the right size piece  Then it's straight into the instructions.  The instructions themselves, in usual LEGO style, are all pictures and symbols.  The manual also has a QR code so you can add it to your sets in the free Lego Life app, and access PDF instructions that you can download or read on your tablet or other device.All told, there are 21 bags of LEGO divided into 4 numbered groups and one unnumbered bag.  Within some of the bags are smaller bags, usually containing smaller parts.  In most of the sets I've done, there are usually 1-3 bags in each numbered group, but this set is unique, so here's how they break down.  Group 1 has 3 bags.  Group 2 has 7 bags.  Group 3 has 5 bags.  Group 4 has 5 bags.  There's also one unnumbered bag, that contains the wheels and fender parts.When you build it, the instructions will have you build using the pieces from the bags labeled ""1"", then once those bags are completed, continue with the pieces from the bags labeled ""2"", and so on.  I've found that it's useful to open all of the bags for the particular number, but keep the pieces a little bit separate.  The pieces aren't randomly distributed between bags - instead, all of the pieces of a particular type may be in one or two bags, so if you dump the bags out and keep the pieces slightly separate, once you've found which pile your piece is in, you may find the rest of them in that same pile or in that one and one other.  This is particularly useful in a set with so many bags per numbered group, because otherwise you will be sifting through quite a lot of pieces to find what you're looking for.Another tip that I find helpful with the larger sets, or anytime I may be doing the build over several sessions, is to use shallow flat containers to separate the contents of the bags, one container per bag.  I got a bunch of fabric-covered lidded bins for organizing my sweaters, but I didn't want to use the lids, so I repurposed them for sorting LEGO or puzzle pieces, and they work perfectly!  They stack pretty well (good if you're short on space or don't want to wander all over to reach what you need) and they allow me to tidy my project in minutes, to continue later, or to move it to another location.  Having some sort of sorting trays can be really useful for the larger sets.Because there are a lot of pieces, if you plan on taking it apart and rebuilding it, a tip: sort the pieces by types.  I usually do something along the lines of ""windows and doors"", ""big plates"", ""tiny pieces"", color groups for pieces for which there are a reasonably large number of pieces, ""random"" for the pieces that don't really have a classification, and so on.  I sort them in stackable trays so I can move them around as needed.  Choose trays that are one color (easier to find pieces against a simple background) and not the same color as your more popular pieces (black pieces on black background are really hard to see).The set does not contain any minifigures because it is not to minifigure scale.  The car is 8 inches high, 16 inches long, and 7 inches wide.  What's pretty neat is there are some special elements new for October 2019, including a new transmission system, which is the most advanced Technic gearbox yet.  There are also cool interactive features in the car - check out the last few pages in the manual to see what fun things it can do.I really like this set.  It's great for any LEGO, LEGO Technic, Land Rover, or classic car fan.  I love the larger sets, so anything with this many pieces is fantastic.  Keep in mind that because of the large piece count and some potentially challenging build techniques, the age suggestion for this set is 11+.  I've found that children younger than this age who are especially skilled at LEGO can enjoy this also, and it can be a great activity for parent and child to share.  It's also great for adults who love LEGO, and want a bigger challenge.

A. Antonio,4.0,2019 17 October,"
First of all, this one is a marvel of engineering.  It's a very complex build with a ton of moving parts.  I believe that's one of the reasons why this one ends up being somewhat annoying.The first big issue - the kit was missing two pieces, but had and extra dozen or so parts.  Maybe I'm just not that good at building these and missed something along the way, but that seemed like a lot of extra parts.Both of the missing parts were in group four of the build and ended up being cosmetic.  Still you paying a big price for this kit.  Any missing parts is really annoying.I wish there was some testing built into instructions.  After I finished the entire kit, I found out that I must have made a mistake in 1st section.  The rear wheels do not turn correctly.  There is a clicking sound.  If testing was built into the instructions, that would have been caught.  Now I have two choices, live with it or spend about 14 hours stripping and rebuilding.Despite the high price and annoying aspects of this kit, it's still amazing to see it function.

turtlex,5.0,2019 16 October,"
I am nothing but impressed with this LEGO TECHNIC LAND ROVER DEFENDER set.It's awesome.First things first, this is a large set. It has 2,573 pieces. Once built, the DEFENDER is about 16"" long, about 8"" high and about 8"" long. This makes up a substantial set.Most impressive in this set is the incredible detail. The moving parts are many and exacting to the actual vehicle. The doors open, of course, but there's so much more. The hood (bonnet!) raises and gives you access to a very life-like engine which includes moving pistons. There's a working winch and the transmission even works it's gears! It's fantastic!( This cool transmission, according to Lego: the New-for-October-2019 transmission system with 2 levers for engaging high or low gear ratios and a selector for changing gear – the most sophisticated LEGO® Technic™ gearbox to date.)This is a detailed and ""harder"" build. Any kid will likely need an adult to help - the directions are great, as with all Lego sets, but they're detailed and long. That being said, this is a great kit for anyone, including any adult - even someone not into Lego who is into automobiles!Once built ... well, it's gorgeous, with official Land Rover decals that supply an authentic look. I truly want to display mine!I would suggest that any Lego collector utilize BrickSet dot com to catalog and track their Lego collection. It's free and a wealth of information.All In All - This Is A Highly Recommended Set! Super Fun. Lots Of Bricks. VERY DETAILED.

BurazeKun,4.0,2020 21 July,"
First, this is a great kit, with functional parts! This excites me, however, I had to barrow parts as some were missing in my kit. Especially the elastic bands. Nothing you could see externally, and honestly there are a lot of parts. I didn't have much time to work on it, so it took me months before I could get started, and about a month to finish, working about 3 hours a week, so about 12 - 15 hours working with my 6 year old son. I may have been able to finish it quicker with my 11 year old son, but he wasn't interested in my lego project. I love it now that it is finished, but I remember the frustration of trying to find missing parts thinking I just misplaced them. I personally never had an issue with missing parts, often getting extras in the end. Not the case here, as I did get extras, just not what I needed.

Hubba Bubba,4.0,2019 31 October,"
My 19yr LEGO fan decided to tackle this & put it together.  He did this over 2 long days after school & homework.  This has the standard LEGO picture instructions book.  Sometimes these are not the easiest to follow & you end up undoing & redoing a few steps.This book has 494 pages.  The last step # 480 is on page 489.  There was an assembly issue with our booklet as it is missing pages 31 through 51.  Also pages 47 - 61 were repeated.  I am SOO glad that LEGO posts full instructions in PDF on their website, just search by the kit # to find them & download.If it was not for that to get the missing pages online, we would have had to return this instead of complete this amazing set.He really likes this set & really enjoyed the challenge of putting this together.

Wow, this Lego set is no joke.  My jaw dropped when the mailman delivered this thing; the box is massive!  With over 2,500 pieces, there is a tremendous amount of build-potential.  The land rover build itself is amazing; fabulous design and it has a multitude of moving pieces.  The details to the engine, gearbox, and all-wheel-drive is just wicked cool.  I did not get this kit because I wanted to display the Land Rover, I got it because I wanted a lot of pieces that I could cannibalize for other Lego builds.  If you need a bunch of various pieces, getting them by buying a set is the way-to-go.  It's a great build, and if you're unfamiliar with some of the more advanced techniques when it comes to TECHNIC builds, this is a great set for you.  The age requirement for this set is for patience.  We had no missing pieces and it took about 13 hours to build with the ""help"" of my son.  The pieces are broken out into numbered packets which makes organizing your build a bit easier.  If you are truly into the Land Rover, you can even buy an LED light kit for it.If you have any questions about the land rover, just ask in the comments and I'll do my best to respond promptly.

I got this for my 11 year old who has surpassed regular Lego sets and wanted something more advanced. He’s into building, designing 3D printed things, and figuring out how stuff works so this was a good fit. The first thing I noticed about the Land Rover Defender was the weight. This is a heavy Lego set, which is to be expected with 2,500 pieces and actual working, moving parts. Once you open the box you are greeted with sorted, bagged parts. Tell your child ahead of time not to rip open the bags and dump all the pieces into a pile. They are divided into:Front endRear casingRoof rack/frontRims and tire hubsRear chassis/gearsThe manual breaks down assembly into small chunks of steps, but depending on your or your child's ability you may need help with the gears. They are very complex to assemble. The rest of the steps are easier than the gearbox and feel more like building a traditional Lego set. What’s cool is that if you have a phone you can scan a code and it takes you to a video showing you how to do certain assemblies.It looks awesome when it’s done, incredibly detailed and seeing the inner workings is really cool. It’s great hands-on learning.

 This kit is a mechanical marvel! I’ve been building with Legos since I can remember back in the mid 1960’s.  This model build was beyond anything I hade ever built. My daughter (12) who is a very advanced builder in her own right, started the build but got lost around step 235. She moved on to build the Hogwarts Castle 71043 set(over 6000 pieces). I had to take it apart back to the first step and rebuild it.  The Land Rover directions are very involved and I actually found it very relaxing to work on after along days work. It took several nights and more than once I got caught up in building after the rest of my family had gone to bed.The attention to detail is amazing. Several times I just had to keep  building, not really knowing how it would all fit together. The photo of the finished bottom of the model describes it best. It is a marvel to watch the pistons on the engine go up and down as the wheels are rotated. The gear range selector, forward/neutral/reverse selector and gear shift “dial”, all work flawlessly. The steering is awesome with its rack and pinion gear meshing as they are turned by the wheel or the roof top knob. Even the winch works!If you are a fan of Land Rovers or just cool stuff, this is a great set. Very happy with the results.

This took us a while to build, but the finished product is so cool! The set says 11+. My 10-year old is great at LEGOs, so we let him start the set. I’ll be honest, he got bored about halfway through, but he was able to follow the directions just fine. My husband took over and finished it.According to both of them, the instructions are clear and easy to follow. The set was missing one piece, but we had another LEGO that could substitute for it. And the finished Jeep is really cool, with pieces that work and move together the way a real car engine would.The only negative is that the pieces are a bit harder to snap together. We’ve experienced this with other LEGO Technic sets too. It’s just the way they are. So a little kid may have trouble putting this one together on his/her own. But this is a minor annoyance in my book. Overall we are extremely happy with the building process and with how the Jeep turned out.

My 12-yo son really wanted this for Christmas after he saw it in the Lego catalog. I ordered it from Lego to get the VIP points to use for the next one he wants ;).The box is impressive. It took him about a week of Christmas break to assemble it, with breaks of course. He was so excited with each step, demonstrating the gear shifts it did and how the suspension worked and then the steering. The pistons moved with the wheels. He hooked it up to a small Lego motor to demonstrate and then to see how fast it would “run” (just the pistons and shaft with gear shifts).He finally finished the body and ran it around over bumps in the house. Various bits came loose with handling, but I expected that. He spent time diagnosing why the pistons changed their pattern and found another loosened part.Overall, excellent build. Not very tight but expected. Challenging for a kid. He is anxiously waiting for the motor kit, although the light kit looks pretty cool. May get the grand tour car next.

Samantha,5.0,2019 20 November,"
Just a heads up this build may take you at least 8 hours. It's challenging but worth it in the end!  It's not perfect and there are some challenges.Upon completion I noticed that the gear box system is finicky and of course if you mess it up you literally have to rebuild the whole thing. When you do get it working you may be disappointed because it's not worth al the hype.The ""motor"" isn't the greatest in terms of the functionality. For example, the linkages which have the bend-ability are very weak / flimsy so the motor doesn't run as it should. In my opinion the actual drivetrain should have a different type of linkage.. maybe something straighter to avoid this issue altogether.Other than that, this thing is top notch in terms of aesthetics.  Very realistic. Impressive that all the parts work. For example, the double steering mechanism, suspension, steering wheel, doors, and even the doors able the lock the back door.

Nerdy Narwhal,5.0,2019 1 November,"
I have never build a Lego Technic set before this month.  The car carrier was my first set, and this is my second.  The number of pieces in this kit is amazing and there are a lot of moving and functional parts that act like the real vehicle does.I would call this set somewhere between intermediate and advanced as far as building skills go.If you are like me and need to sort and organize all of your pieces before building, you are going to need to set aside a good chunk of space while you sort and organize your parts.  I wound up using some craft divider totes for holding a bunch of the parts so that they didn't get mixed up again.  (Personally I find the sorting to be the most fun part of building lego sets, but I know that I am an odd duck.)
"
Rk Star,5.0,2019 20 October,"
Our home is a huge fan of legos. We love a good challenge and this one brings it! My husband has been working on this with our kids for a while and they have had so much fun methodically putting this thing together. The detail is absolutely incredible, as well as the engineering with all the moving parts! This is so cool and definitely one of our best builds.Lego did an amazing job keeping everything in sections and outlining the directions on how to do it. There is NO RUSH to build this. This is a project! Once completed it's so satisfying and beautiful!  What a fantastic gift for any young builder or a project to just tinker with. I'm floored by the quality of this set. We love you LEGO! Keep making amazing sets like this!
"
Living it Up!,5.0,2020 22 April,"
I am a 60-something grandma who still loves her Legos.Retirement and covid have created lots of Lego building opportunities.This Land Rover is my first Technics build in decades, and I LOVED IT!!!The finished product is beautiful and you will feel proud of your accomplishment if you were patient and thorough and got every single step correct.It was a good, focused build.I do have trouble sometimes with the way various neutral colored tiles are portrayed in the printed instructions, and I wish Lego would do a better job with color accuracy in matching the colors of actual pieces and making clear distinctions between similar neutrals.  I did use the lego app a couple of times to figure out pieces.You do NOT want to have to take this apart to trace a mistake. Nope, you really do not.I have a few Technics sets in my cart now deciding on my next project
"
Andrew K.,3.0,2021 14 August,"
I purchased this from Costco back at Christmas from Costco, the model is cool and great to build but it is the gearing that gets me.  So first off this is a great pooking model and definitely enjoyed building it, it worked great once complete but after a few months the gears are skipping.  I have since taken it back apart to see if I can figure out where the main issue is occurring.  In high it operates just fine but when in low, while pushing it, you can see the valves struggle to keep up and skip after more than pushing further than a foot.  The valve rods you can see stop then all of a sudden catch up really fast, the way Lego did the gearing is poor.  I feel like I can say rgus as I had one of the first year boxed Lego vehicles, I placed it on my dad's treadmill at 10 MPH while in first year, not once did the gears slip but instead it started shredding the tires and twisting the main axle.  I was a young teen at this point and figured such might happen but still NO GEAR SKIPPED.  I am now an engineer and kbow much more about gearing, once I jave the chance to figure out why this happened I will report back but for now I am dissatisfied with this model.
"
D. Michael Elkins,5.0,2019 5 November,"
When there's 489 pages of instructions, you know that you're in for hours of work assembling this vehicle.  And yes, it did take me over three weeks or so working an hour or two every few days but it was well worth the effort.  So many gears and moving parts and such detail.  Plenty of decals too. Even the shock absorbers work.  Sadly I was missing a couple of pieces, one of which was required to attach the headrest to the front seat passenger's seat but I should be able to order a replacement piece and the other missing pieces weren't as essential.  Of course, there were a number of extra pieces supplied, just not the ones that I needed!  All in all, this is probably the most impressive Lego construction project that I've worked with since the Statute of Liberty.
"
Bubblie,5.0,2019 30 October,"
This is a very heavy set, the box comes almost up to my knee high. Intended age is 11+, perfect for my god son who is 11 this year.With over 2500 pieces, this set will take a while to build, so I’m holding off until the holidays when we have more time to build this over a weekend. I’ve done a similar LEGO building project with my god son and god daughter over the summer and they both loved it. It gets the kids away from their iPads and video games for a while, making them use motor skills and problem solving skills.This is great for kids who likes to put thing together. Will update with pictures in a few weeks when we’re ready to tackle this project.
"
Zeldie Stuart,5.0,2020 25 July,"
Overall amazing with very complex mechanisms...engineered to perfection but may be too difficult  for younger children.  Requires much attention to detail.  If you are a lego afficiando (like me) this set will keep you occupied and very happy.  A special gift I highly recommend to a lego lover.  (I received it from my grandparents for my 14th bday) Took me 7 hours (I am a pro lego builder)  4 hours one day, 3 hours the next.  It is a gorgeous car and fabulous to build and then to look at with all the special features.  I will make it remote control so it actually moves.
"
MrE,5.0,2020 10 June,"
I feel like Technic has been knocking it out of the park lately with their sets -- they are fun to build, they are looking more complete/better and the functionality of the model works better as well (some of the older bigger sets had issues with flexing and such).The Land Rover looks great, lots of fun little features, it steers, roof rack is removable/customizable, goes up and down, etc.  The engine even moves with the wheels -- which is fairly common in technic but they changed up the design a bit for this, and it's pretty cool.
"
Gail Rodgers,5.0,2019 5 December,"
This is one huge and awesome kit! Over 2500 pieces and if you look at the picture, instead of all sorts of other things to make, the Land-rover is pretty much it. Instead of just making the outside of the vehicle, with this set the user ends up building the inner parts of it as well. This would be a great and I assume a long term project for a Lego lover as well a car enthusiast. I would so much rather see kids making up this set then planting themselves in front of the TV or a computer game.Thank you for the opportunity to review this great Lego product.

"
teeinep,5.0,2019 20 October,"
It has many parts and it requires skill.  This is a great father/son project.  I ordered for my nephew but he needed help from his dad to complete the project.  The model is realistic and fun, great gift for sharing time with the kids or gift it to an adult who is a fan of the brand.  Impressive to build and impressive results; my little nephew needed guidance but he felt a sense of accomplishment when done.
"
Lemon,5.0,2019 25 October,"
I really enjoyed Legos as a kid, and have been giving them as a gift to the kids in my life. But this set caught my eye to personally assemble, as I am a big fan of the Land Rover Defender, so I decided to re-emerse myself in Legoland.  This is a huge set that comes in a suprisingly large box. It is intricate and very detailed, and a lot of fun. The Defender is impressive, was fun to assemble, and now looks great on the shelf.
"
Andrew S. Kirmayer,5.0,2020 1 August,"
This model is amazing! It's even harder than the giant excavator (with even the light kit). I had to do the first part over; made too many mistakes with post alignment and gears, so it seemed a do-over was the right thing. Now I've gone beyond that. My advice is to pay attention to every last detail in the instructions and watch out for parts hiding inside others. But this is most definitely a project. Just trying to take it all in before it's finished!

This was a very impressive and fun set to put together. The amount of detail and level of difficulty was a good challenge and took a while. It's probably the most complex build I've done yet. And it's much larger than any other vehicle I've assembled. This will definitely be on display, but there are plenty of working parts that are fun to show off.

I’m the biggest LEGO advocate ever. They provide hours of fun, thought and dexterity are needed. This Truck is no exception. More than 2500 pieces. So lay out a mat, get little containers for the pieces and create... I mean, let the kiddies create 🤣 perfect gift for those who love trucks and putting things together.
"
Andrew L,5.0,2019 3 November,"

This would hav a been a great build if it wasn’t missing pieces. The worst part is I didn’t realize things were missing till I was over halfway done. This was beyond frustrating and very disappointing, you think for a $200 Lego set everything would be here.
"
John T. Horner,5.0,2019 10 October,"
This is a big kit which took a very experienced builder about 11 hours to assemble. The final result is stunning in the build was very satisfying. one piece was missing, but Lego sent a replacement parts straight away.this is a great set for the really serious Lego fan. note that it is a Technic style build which is a little different from conventional Lego kits.
"
Morgan Lea Lamb,1.0,2021 19 November,"
I expected a brand new Lego Technic Land Rover Defender (42110).  This is a gift for my husband.  While I have not opened the Lego box as this is for Christmas, the box itself has been previously opened and both ends taped shut with wear on the corners and denting from wear opened.  Other sets I purchased directly from Lego all were glued shut with no wear on the corners of the boxes.  I anticipate this being used.  I will give a follow-up review once this has been opened to see if the bags were torn or not.

Dave dives deep,3.0,2021 18 January,"

"
Courtney Haine,1.0,2020 6 December,"
This is the first time I rage quit a Lego kit. I bought this at Costco for my son. After we completed the running gear and tried to test out the transmission and transfer case we experienced severe driveline binding and cracking. We tore down and rebuilt the entire thing twice, double checking every step, and still the driveline binds to the point of gears skipping and wheels locking up. It’s not just us either. There are many videos on YouTube about issues with this kit.

yyz,5.0,2021 26 February,"
What a great model.  My 12 year old loves complicated gear constructions.  This kit is full of them.  The three main parts under the body, front, middle, and aft are like 3 mechanical watches.  I let the little guy build all of that.  The second half of the kit is the body.  He was bored to death, so I built the rest.  Typical Lego quality and fun.  Sturdy.  Of the parts I was 'allowed' to build, the door hinges were way cool.This drivetrain is complicated.  Next, we are going to motorize it.  Motorizing the steering will be super simple, but I expect to spend hours figuring out how best to tie into the drivetrain.  Love it.

I loved Legos in my youth and I’ve recently decided to pick them back up.This was my first Lego purchase in many years and it was a terrific first choice.There was not a single piece missing!Total assemble time was spread over 4 days with about 3 hours session each for a total of 12 hours to assemble.The instructions are extremely clear, as they should be and I had a blast the entire time listening to podcasts while assembling.  I would say the difficulty level was medium.It’s quite cathartic assembling Lego’s!I’m already eyeballing my next one as this one will find a nice new home on my collectors shelf.

R. Kirby,5.0,2022 14 May,"
This was a pretty challenging build.  I wouldn't say it was as hard as the Bugatti Chiron that I built previously, but definitely harder than the DB5, Ecto-1, and Back to the Future Delorean builds I've also done recently.It actually feels pretty sturdy.  I feel like I could let my 5 year old nephew play around with it and he wouldn't destroy it (unlike the Ferrari 488 set).The top steering makes it a little more useful to play around with.  Other vehicles like the Chiron and Ferrari have functional steering wheels, but you can't turn them and move the car at the same time unless you are very talented (I am not).I didn't like the winch.  Too hard to use and retract.  I'm not a sticker fan, but this set only had a few.Overall, I recommend it.

El manual tiene un aproximado de 860 pasos, por lo que sugiero en el ensamble se haga con mucho, pero mucho cuidado, cualquier descuido podría llevarte a desarmar un gran avance. La calidad de las calcomanías es de lo mejor.Para el armado del ""gearbox"" es realizarlo con una delicadeza y asegurarte que todo, pero todo este perfectamente ensamblado, sin espacios, todo prácticamente a la medida ya que al no hacerlo, el set puede presentar un ruido molesto al usarlo en el ""gearbox"". Sus funciones, aunque manuales, son una maravilla. Si quieres tener una mejor idea de lo que hablo y no te animas a comprarlo, observa el review de ""Sariel"" en Youtube, para que te des una mejor idea de lo que este set es.

Como sempre, a Lego surpreendendo com as suas criações! Já sou fã e tenho uma coleção de peças especiais, mas esse foi diferente de todos. Para quem ainda é admirador Land Rover, esse item é praticamente obrigatório! Aproveitei uma oferta do dia e consegui um excelente desconto! Nota mil!

Si te gustan los vehículos y te gustan los productos Lego, este set está perfecto.El motor simula movimiento,  la suspensión realmente funciona, etc. Realmente vale la pena cada peso que pagas.

When finished its pretty cool . Hard to build at times and hard to read the manual and specific parts. I had to go back multiple times and re build parts because I either forgot to put a piece on or put the wrong piece somewhere.

Esse foi um dos Legos mais divertidos que já montei. Sou fã dos Technic, e esse foi fantastico. O realismo do motor, caixa de marchas e 4x4 é incrível. Apesar do grande numero de peças, só veio faltando uma, no final da montagem, mas felizmente tinha de outro conjunto, e assim não ficou incompleto.

3 real land rovers and one Lego. Great Lego car. Built 2 and one i sold it. Very complicated kit comparing it with e.g. mustang, beetle, mini, db5. It has a working gearbox, differentials, suspension, winch and the list goes on and on and almost 500 pages of instructions. You must be very careful not to forget any step or any piece behind. There is a clicking noise when having forward gear but other than that I could easily built a third if i had the chance, just for the fun of it.  And anyway, its a land rover, its not meant to work properly all the time..... :)

Took 7h42m to build.  Was a great way to spend the day.  Only disappointment was that they put the shipping label directly on the original box and shipped like that.  The label is not removable and therefore destroyed the collectibility of the product.

Perfecto. El paquete llegó en el tiempo estimado.La caja tenía un pequeño golpe en una esquina, nada grave y nade que haya dañado el producto. Por lo visto la caja de Amazon, donde metieron la caja de la camioneta, quedaba grande y por eso se golpeo un poco...Igual con un poco de plástico de protección quedaría perfecto.

We've been travelling in our 25' travel trailer for the past 2 months and found that there wasn't space for our drinks nks in the RV fridge.  Due to this, we looked into electric coolers and portable refrigerators, and found we wanted a refrigerator.  This is because it cools to the point of refrigeration but does not run constantly.This Bodega fridge cools very quickly, holds up to larger size bottles (think 2 liters or wine bottles) and has a large capacity.  For the price point it was a great deal as it has both the cigarette lighter adapter as well as the 12 volt.  We take it in the truck with us when not camping.  We've been using it nonstop for a month with no problemsHighly recommend and would purchase again.

No mosquitos in the Georgia woods during hunting season. Doesn’t affect deer either.

Pro: works well, pads are easy to use.Con: remove pads after use, while machine cools, pads are still warmed and run out faster.

H. Phar,4.0,2022 4 July,"
This this is amazing. It actually keeps the mosquitos away. But….then you have to buy new replacement things every day because they burn up so fast it’s crazy. They aren’t cheap either. Can’t afford to keep the mosquitos away with this thing. Only for about 30-60mins a day.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2022 19 June,"
Mosquitoes LOVE me. I use this product and I have a noticeable reduction in mosquitoes.  I have even noticed less flies around while it's on. I like that it's refillable but it seems like it kinda runs out quick. Maybe it's just mine but you are able to get hours off of 1 pad. I recommend

Our daughter gave us the repeller as a gift. We purchased these refills which have been doing the job. We like to sit outside on our patio in the evenings. The Thermacell Insect Repeller works great. No odor, just a little smoke which you can barely see. It really keeps mosquitoes away. This contained 3 bottles of repellant that just screw in and 3 pads that slide in the top. Should last many evenings  with 36 hrs of protection.

Cynthia L.,4.0,2021 20 August,"
I love this product! No spray and it still keeps tye bugs away. I turn it on 5 or 10 minutes before I'm going to be outside and the machine does the rest. The only reason it got a 4 🌟  is the pads DO NOT last 4 hours as advertised. 2 hours max.
"
Karen M.,2.0,2022 31 July,"
While the unit does work, the pad that is saturated in mosquito repellent does work, it only lasts a maximum of 4 hours. The butane cartridge only lasts 12 hours. I’m going broke always buying these refills. Just get a big bucket candle of citronella.
"
Billi  Wilson-Andrzejewski,5.0,2021 7 November,"
These work thank God, or I would not have been able to enjoy my outside porch.I do think they a expensive, based on how long they last. I made sure to turn it off if I was going inside so it wasn't wasted.
"
SAVVY PERFECTIONIST,5.0,2021 20 July,"
I USE EVERYDAY AND ORDERING MORE AFTER THIS REVIEW.  EXPENSIVE FOR ME FOR HOW MANY HOURS IT LASTS AND SO IS EXPENSIVE!  WORTH IT TO NOT GET BIT BECAUSE IT WORKS!  I GOT BIT WHEN WALKING MY DOG AND NEVER FELT THE MOSQUITO BITE UNTIL MY HAND SWELLED UP!SO IT'S WORTH IT AND THERE IS NO SMELLY ORDER 'AT ALL!'  SO THAT'S A BIG PLUS!!!

It is too expensive, compared to repellent. Mosquitos don't care about it. Save your money.
"
Vern,5.0,2020 27 July,"
Product seems to work as advertised. Except runs out of fliud to soon ! I think the heat we have been having added to that. We got 1 tank of fuol to 1 pad !  We have ordered more refills. Or maybe that 1st one was defective.  I only had 1 of those sneaky bast\*€+  you know what i mean !  Lol must have been hiding under the table. 😁😮 I ""ll give another review if it doesn't get better on the 2nd rd

I got my 12 hour butane refill but it only lasted 7 hours. At this rate if the other 2 reills go at the same rate Ive paid for 21 hours ;94 a 36 hr cost.Still would recommend but say its really expensive.
"
Piwacket,4.0,2020 25 September,"
This does keep them away, but it seems like the butane doesn't last as long as it used to.  I was surprised when it ran out so quickly.  Oh well, for me, it works.
"
Reviewer,5.0,2020 13 August,"
If you’re on the edge, trust these really really work. We live in MN and our summer nights are full of mosquitos until we turn these on. Not the most pleasant scent but it’s bearable and worth it.Just beware the pads only last one night each and the butane maybe a few times and refills are pretty expensive. But again they work really well.

This product works wonderfully. Used with the Therma Cell unit. This unit will keep mosquito's at bay for a 15' to 16' radius.  Here in FL we deal with massive amounts of misquotes during late summer. This will protect you even in the swamps  & during hunting season. No KIDDING!!!

The repeller that these are made for works GREAT for keeping mosquitos off our porch. We set it at our feet so it wafts up all around us, and it truly keeps mosquitos (and usually flies) away. LOVE IT! Just remember to turn it off when you go inside or you’ll run out the cartridge.
"
Brian&Felicia March,5.0,2021 18 January,"
I do really like these. I have found it most effective to place this product closer to the floor, especially if your legs are exposed and you're on a raise porch/ deck.  It really works well and there's no harsh odors.
"
Mary Lucia Norris,5.0,2021 16 August,"
Effective and yet compact!  No noise, no order, and no bugs!!!
"
Ashley,5.0,2020 30 July,"
This item, combined with the Thermacell bug repellant, is awesome. Sure, refills are a little costly, but I get eaten alive even on my deck. I always have on bug spray and a fan going, and this is really the only thing that truly works. I hope they make them forever.
"

"
Kari,1.0,2022 21 July,"
Buy from product website or sporting goods store instead. I attempted to save myself a trip to the store/shipping costs from ordering online but these are a waste of money. Purchasing elsewhere ensures  the 4 hour lasting capability of the refill pads. These start turning white after 10-15 minutes of use and don’t last more than 45 minutes. No issues with the fuel refill as of yet.
"
Beverly,4.0,2020 15 June,"

"
Papajay,5.0,2020 3 September,"
The best mosquito repeller I've used, once you start it up, wait 10-15 minutes & it pretty much clears them out. You forget it's there because, being you're not getting bit by mosquitos, your not thinking about them.
"
adgey,1.0,2022 3 September,"

Mosquito loves me and we couldn’t use our porch anytime of the day without being eaten alive. My neighbor was having the same problem and ordered this product first. I waited to see if it really worked and after a week I decided I would order one too. It does what it is supposed to do. My only issue with is the cost versus time used it doesn’t last very long, and you need to change the fuel pad often. Love it but not cheap.

We can’t use open flames outside where we live. I like the thermacell as an alternate to the citronella candels and feel like it works. It’s a nice way to also avoid having repellent directly on your skin. This pack came as expected and fits our thermacell.

I’m never going back to a duffel bag for the gym.  This is sturdy but still lightweight.  It has a larger pocket for my main stuff.  After my shower the wet towel and sandals have another smaller pocket on the front to go into so as not to soak my other clothes.  I also use the front for swim trunks.  The only change I would make would be a little larger bottle holders on the sides.  These are a bit tight for a blender bottle sized cup.  The tiny pocket on the front holds my earbuds, wallet, and lock just fine.  It’s a bit snug for a large cell phone though.

Nice bag, with lots of space and pocket options. Fits my need for gym, where I carry lots of extra staff (bands, bandages, gloves, 2 bottles, 2 towels, sneakers, flipflops, cosmetic pouch etc). Looks cool, durable quality.

Tracy Salisbury,5.0,2021 1 October,"
My son is loving his Adidas soccer bag.We had initially purchased an off brand bag (not knowing if he would stick with the sport), but the thing looked worn out by the end of spring session and completely shredded by the end of summer camp.By comparison, he’s used the same adidas duffle for his martial arts gear did the past 4 years and it still looks new.We replaced his soccer bag and couldn’t be happier.Would love if this bag had a shoe pocket on the bottom, but overall very pleased

Simple soccer bag that holds everything and has a place for everything. Large main pocket a medium size one that is great for cleats and shinepads. And a small pocket for phone or valuables. Mesh zipper pocket in large compartment for small items. Just an all around great soccer bag, or really any sport.
"

Anonymous Reader,5.0,2021 24 March,"
Has held up well for over a year with no issues. pre-pandemic, used 2-3x a week for indoor and futsal games, holding ball, cleats, pumps, socks, tape, phone, water bottle, keys, etc. Only had one small tear of a drawstring on one side that didn't affect the pocket holding the ball securely. It would be great if it had a laptop sleeve as I like using this backpack as a general use / travel backpack as well. Also get compliments on this bag, and my teammate saw it and bought the same one. Would recommend this bag and would buy again.
"
edcolion,5.0,2021 15 October,"
I like this backpack! It has great compartments, very durable. I also noticed that at the bottom of the bag the fabric is different, more like a water proof texture, I like that it is different because it is more durable and will not get dirty easily!

La mochila está igual que como se muestra en las fotos, es buena calidad, y tiene bastante espacio, el color es vivo, no está para nada opaco y mi hijo la ocupa para la escuela y también para su entrenamiento. 100% recomienda
"
Dan B,5.0,2021 6 March,"
We purchased this for my son for soccer.  His team had an order through a third party for close to double the price so we took to amazon to find a better deal, although not with embroidery.  His bag holds his ball and has several compartments for uniform, cleats, socks, drinks etc.  Everything needed in one convenient pack so everything is not all over the place.  I am glad that we purchased this.
"
Christopher Blake,5.0,2021 26 April,"
It was perfect for using as a track bag, while it didn’t say it would work as a track bag, it has the room for my foam rollers and a few hand rollers in the first portion of the bag. The second portion is made to fit shoes or spikes and it works very well for when I need to put my spikes into a protected area of the bag.
"
Brandy,5.0,2021 18 June,"
This is a great soccer bag at great price. Second one I've purchased because my other child started playing for the same soccer club. Navy soccer bags are hard to find and I feel we ""scored"" finding this one. Ample space for cleats, ball and pockets for other things. Great value and a great looking backpack.

I bought two of these for my middle school kids. We received them quickly. They was very good quality for half the price of local sports shop stores. Both bags are used daily. Enough room for cleats, clothes, shin guards and everything else they need in their bags. The straps are well padded for a comfortable fit on the shoulders.
"

Not to bulky, fits well on my daughter. As promised
"
Enika Frasheri,5.0,2020 18 June,"
Love the fact that you can fit 3 balls in this bag but that does not leave a lot of room for much else - Very versatile as you can carry all you need for soccer practice or if you want to head to the park to have fun. Many color selections to choose from. - beware of the tiny straps by the zipper heads as they ten to come apart. It you take a bit of time to heat the nylon straps you will protect them.
"
Stephanie Kern,5.0,2021 3 July,"
I wish we had bags like this when I was in school playing soccer. I was surprised how well my daughter's soccer ball fit into the bag while still having room for other stuff.  I couldn't even tell her ball was in there.
"
Robert,5.0,2021 4 March,"
Awesome bag, well made and sturdy.I use this to keep most items needed for my whole team - jerseys, ball, first aid kit - along with my equipment. The separate ball and shoe compartments make it easy to pack up for games/practice. The small pouch keeps phone, keys, wallet, etc. all secure.Really happy with the bag.
"
Derek N,5.0,2021 25 July,"

"
Timothy Bolden,5.0,2021 30 January,"
Bought for 11 year old soccer player. Has a lot of space and is a great backpack for a soccer player because it’s spacious for water, soccer ball, cleats, shin guards and extra clothing. If you child or you play soccer this backpack is a must! The backpack is sturdy and looks like it will last long. Thank you!
"
Cameron,5.0,2021 20 May,"
I like it's lifetime warranty so I know this pack is made well.  Very sturdy and not as bulky as some of the other soccer packs I've seen kids use. Side pockets for water bottles could be a more loose to fit in bigger bottles but it was stitched well.

"
KDW,3.0,2020 7 February,"
All three of my kids (ages 10 and 6) received these soccer bags for Christmas - they play year round and are headed multiple times a week to soccer practice/games. We love the space and various pouches this bag offers for snacks, gloves, a water bottle, shin guards, cleats, sandals, a change of clothes, futsal shoes, and a ball! My only complaint is that of the three bags I purchased, two have now proven faulty. The first one I was able to replace inside the 30-day window - the drawstring of the ball pouch ripped. On the second bag the mesh water bottle pouch ripped from the elastic edging one day after the 30-day window, so I'm currently trying to reach Adidas to resolve the issue. Both instances occurred after only using the bag less than a month. For a sports bag lugged around by active kids I would think the assembly and stitching would be reinforced for durability. Again, we love the functionality, appearance, and size, but are disappointed by the quality of this bag distributed by a reputable brand.

Hammer,5.0,2021 1 February,"
With covid, my player cannot store his gear in the gymnasium locker room for hoops. He has to carry it with him in school. This bag is big enough for his clothes, shoes, accessories and a ball.  Not too big and not too small. Perfect for practice time and games.

Stephanie,5.0,2019 2 August,"
I bought this for my daughter, she was looking for a bag that can hold her soccer ball. She’s also obsessed with adidas so this was actually perfect. The bag is very spacious and the inside has a pretty color. I work long hours so sometimes she has to stay at my mothers house and she’s able to pack her next day clothes along with all of her soccer stuff and everything fits in perfectly. She absolutely loves it.  Would definitely recommend.  Everything is exactly as they advertised. Thanks!
"
Jess,4.0,2020 9 September,"
This is definitely a good quality backpack. I gave it 4 stars only because it is on the small side if you have a middle or high school age student. I actually wound up buying something different with a larger capacity.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 10 April,"
This is a great backpack and feels like built for soccer players. I can easily put in my soccer ball, cleats, 2/3 pairs of socks, shinguard, spare jersey, ball pump, spray, gatorades etc. My only complaint would be that I have to put in everything before the soccer ball. If I put in the soccer ball first, then I have to struggle to fit in everything (specially the cleats). Also, sometimes chaining up with the ball inside is a tad difficult but not much of an issue. Honestly, I am nitpicking at this point. Overall great product. Highly recommended.

Black Cat,5.0,2018 16 October,"
This is the fifth Adidas Stadium backpack we own.  Had the previous version for soccer which came apart at the top seams so decided to upgrade to the Stadium II.  It did not disappoint. This bag is slightly larger in all compartments which easily holds all the gear which is needed going into colder weather.  Having the option to use the mesh drawstring to carry a ball outside or inside was a nice upgrade. Have one bag for soccer and use another for Basketball. If deciding between the older version and the Stadium II, the Stadium II is a better choice.

I wanted to leave a review because I searched for HOURS trying to find a bag for my daughter. I never did find a small bag that was pink and good quality so I opted to just buy one of the best soccer backpacks out there and hope it wasn’t too big.The bag is perfect! Yes it’s big but it’s not ginormous. My daughter is about average height for her age. The bag goes down to her butt but it’s not so big it’s in the way and she will be able to use this bag for many years.

This backpack has frame edge on the water bottle holders/pockets and on the bottom of the backpack so it can stand. Plus, the water bottle pocket is deeper. It also has a bigger pocket for your headbands and other small things. Additionally, the ball compartment has double support. Mesh and top fabric on the backpack. I am very impressed with this backpack and I’m very excited to use it for the first time today.
"
Daniel Jennings,4.0,2019 27 June,"
This is a $50 backpack for soccer. Fits light needs - shoes, tape, water, soccer ball.I don’t like the mesh pullout holder for the ball. It doesn’t tighten too much to keep the ball in place.Probably not a good bag for keepers with jerseys and gloves and other specific needs.Overall, it is a nice backpack. Just don’t expect it to be “top of the line”.

Vixen Foxx,1.0,2022 27 March,"
Extremely disappointed.I purchased this backpack around September of last year, but didn’t start using it until about a month ago.The handle at the top is tearing away from the base, the arm straps are now starting to do the same thing. I’ve hardly got any use out of this backpack and it’s literally falling apart on me and about to be unusable. And because of when I purchased this, there’s nothing anyone can do to help me apparently. Not Amazon, not Adidas.But let’s be real here, even if I were using it every day since September, even that is unacceptable to have this bag tearing in me in such short time.If you won’t make your products of good quality, at least give your customers better customer service. I feel ripped off. Do better.
"
alejandra e.,4.0,2019 28 May,"
The bag looks great! I took it on a camping trip & plan to continue using it for other occasions. Fits lots of stuff. The only problem is that it is not very comfortable to wear because it's a bit large. I saw the photos someone posted of their young child wearing it, but it definitely appears to be bigger in person!
"
Wanderer,5.0,2020 9 October,"
Great soccer backpack! Fits a full size ball inside with plenty of room for other gear. Plus deep water bottle pockets. Lots of zip up pockets for various items! Perfect for my teen.
"
SoYouKnow,2.0,2022 10 March,"
I like the color, green is great and inside is lime, which is fun. Nice Adidas styling. Yet.  Zippers do not stay closed. And, for a soccer bag/for people on the go, people who move fast...is not secure. Have lost stuff due to this fact. Inane. And costly.

This bag is everything I needed as I was looking for an alternative to bringing around a duffle bag. Duffles make it tiresome after a while and this bag had all the room I needed.  Another good thing about it is the different compartments, one for shoes, ball, and an area to put clothes and other amenities. Overall, a well rounded bag with a nice aesthetic too.

My son has gone through 3 back packs in one year. I’m sick of paying $100 for a new one so I found this one. It works great!!! It has stayed clean and not one zipper has broke yet! I think it’s the best back pack we have bought and the price is unbeatable
"
James Kerman,5.0,2021 26 May,"
Great bag holds everything
"
Bethanie t.,5.0,2019 16 December,"
Bought for my daughter who plays competitive soccer, this bag is not only durable and comfortable but its big enough for her soccer ball, 2 uniforms, cleats and a pair of sliders. AND STILL HAS SPACE for other items when needed.
"
E. Herrera,3.0,2021 17 April,"
The backpack is very nice, but after using it for a month, and my son getting it muddy due to a soccer tournament, I had to wash it.  Can’t believe it’s falling apart.  Not happy about it!
"
Sarah,5.0,2020 6 August,"

Great bah fits everything I need it for.
"
Jordan,5.0,2020 2 February,"
This is our second stadium bag. The first bag was for a different team and in a different color. Regardless we like this bag and find it the best bag for our little soccer player.
"
jys1011,5.0,2019 8 April,"
Bought this for my kids to lug around basketball gear including shoes,  knee pads, water, sweatshirts etc. There's plenty of room for all of this and then some even a ball if wanted to bring it along. I like the different compartments for each thing like their phone, ear buds, water bottle and shoes. It's great!!
"
michelle gorczynski,5.0,2021 29 April,"

"
PhotoMom,5.0,2019 30 August,"
My kids use these for their competitive soccer team. So far so good. Holds all of their gear, I won't daresay that my kids are organized, but this gives them the potential to be! Seems sturdy enough, but only time and teenager testing will tell!
"
ashley,2.0,2021 13 August,"
I purchased this backpack for my middle school son to start school with. After day 2 we have realized this backpack is not big enough for his daily items he has to carry. It does not expand very much. We will have to purchase a different backpack that expands more. Other than that, seems like a good quality backpack but if you will be carrying multiple items, it may not be a good choice.
"
Corpo Da Paz,5.0,2019 31 October,"
My daughter plays 6 days a week .  Bag has performed well in all kinds of weather.  She does wish it had one more uniform compartment but as is provides good cleat clothes separation.
"
Grammy,5.0,2020 1 January,"
Unisex backpack that all athletes can appreciate.  From clothing to soccer ball,shoes there are separate compartments for each and zippers are secure.  Believe this will last quite a long time.
"

"
That Guy,5.0,2019 9 March,"
He has been using this bag for awhile now and it has been durable to stand up to a teenager not taking good care of it, I mean it smells but otherwise is still put together. Well built, good quality, better price than your big box store. Thanks!

"
Soccer Mom,5.0,2018 25 December,"

David A Schaupp,3.0,2019 11 November,"
Really good backpack.  Hold a lot of gear and has plenty of space for soccer ball.  Only had one issue. We had to replace the zipper after one year.  Not sure if issue with bag, or if our daughter was just too hard on the bag.  We were able to replace zipper and haven't had any issues since.
"
Jamie K,5.0,2020 29 January,"
Great packpack!! Well made with strong"" reinforced straps for heavy school day loads. My daughter loves the sporty and stylish look.
"
Lori D,5.0,2019 3 October,"
Love the expandable ball holder that zips away when not needed, doubles as a wet stuff holder.  Good balance in size.  I use for gym and field.
"
Elizabeth D.,3.0,2020 11 July,"
The material was very thin and very little structure. It feels like a bag pack rather then a back pack. I anticipate this backpack will last our ten year old a single school year, if that.  His last backpack was a Paragon, it lasted three years!
"

"
S. Conner,5.0,2018 9 November,"
Both my kids have lugged these around for the last 2.5 years. They still look pretty much new despite rough handling. Just make sure you put the ball in before you pack the rest of the bag. Great soccer bag!

Great back! Sturdy material. My son Carrie's it everywhere. Soccer ball, cleats, clothes and water bottle all fit with room to spare.
"
Claire C.,2.0,2020 25 February,"
After the first use, the adjustable cord popped and no longer holds the soccer ball. I bought this a few months prior to giving my daughter as a gift, hence the Amazon return window passed. I contacted Adidas, they ensured there was a lifetime warranty. Except... I needed to contact a THIRD point of contact..... their manufacturer. I will just buy another brand and call it quits on this backpack. Not a big purchase, but crappy customer service on faulty product from a reputable brand.

The bag holds a ton and having separate pockets helps keep sweaty socks away from clean clothes
"
LB,2.0,2018 22 June,"
If you carry a ball and cleats, there’s very limited room in the large zippered pocket for anything else. In the small zippered valuables pocket, it was very difficult to fit a wallet, phone, and keys. They had to be forcefully squished in.  I like to carry a ball, cleats, shin guards, socks, extra shirt, pump, and large water bottle. I could fit it all in the bag eventually, but it took a lot of squeezing/maneuvering.  I personally need a larger bag, but this might work well for you if you don’t have a lot of stuff.

I am very picky about bags.  This was the third one I ordered. We are on our third season with this bag.  It easily fits everything you could possibly need for a soccer or basketball player.  We even used it as a baseball bag because a helmet with faceguard will fit into the ball pocket. One small complaint is that the water bottle pockets are a bit tight for reusable water bottles.  Overall, very happy with this purchase.

UPDATE: After a complete season of soccer, this backpack is still going strong. Material is super strong, and the bottom is in great shape. He not only uses it for soccer gear, but also as his daily book bag for high school. Zippers are still in one piece, straps are not showing any signs of stress, and the carry handle is doing great as well. Well constructed and the stitching is still  holding strong.Definitely would purchase this pack again!!Exactly what my son wanted for soccer. Awesome pack and looks like it should last for quite some time.

Ricky Cavazos,4.0,2021 20 November,"
I was looking for a large backpack to use for the gym. This backpack has two large compartments. In the main compartment, I can easily fit my weight lifting belt, my weight lifting gloves, knee sleeves, wrist wraps, barbell bar clamps, and elbow sleeves. I use the second compartment to store my weight lifting shoes.There is a small pocket / compartment right above the compartment where the soccer ball is supposed to go. It is very small, and the only item I am able to fit comfortably in it are the keys to my vehicle. Therefore, I use the compartment intended for the soccer ball to store the keys to my vehicle as well as my cell phone, which fits much better.

Momma Mould,5.0,2021 20 December,"
As a mother of 5, with 3 in school I've been on the hunt for backpacks that will actually hold up all school year and not have to be patched or completely replaced by Christmas. This is it. These are the best backpacks by far that I have ever purchased. My daughter doesn't have a locker and has to haul all of her stuff around classroom to classroom all day and this backpack has stood up to the challenge. The padded shoulder straps are life changing and no more whining in the mornings while trying to get out the door about heavy backpacks or awkward backpacks. Tons of room inside for everything your littles may need for school and then some. My school age range from middle school-3rd and it's the perfect size even being a larger backpack. We will never go back to anything else if you're looking for a sign to buy this, this is it.

I bought this for my son he’s just now starting fourth grade. And this is the backpack that he just had to have! A little pricey for a fourth grader but I’m very happy with it purchase!Is extremely durable and will ask him for a couple years at least. It’s very very very spacious!!!I have two very large main compartments. A small microfiber lined Pocket in the front top that hold his phone (IPhone 6s plus)And I have a very awesome bottom compartment that has a net inside of it.Are you unzip it and open the compartment and it’s a completely huge spacious place that could fit like a basketball without taking up any room of the main compartments.I definitely recommend buying this product!

The way this is designed makes it pretty much a great school backpack. I don't know about you, but my kid doesn't carry a laptop to school. Not sure why 99% of backpacks these days have a laptop compartment. This one does not have one, and also no excessive padding inside (which is - again - not needed). In the soccer ball compartment, he puts his gym strip (separate from everything else, when it gets wet and smelly). In the shoe compartment, he can put his shoes AND his lunch bag. And in the main compartment, he was able to fit three 1.5"" binders and his pencil case. The top compartment that is fleece lined is perfect for this phone, or a calculator, or anything else small. Two side pockets for bottles, and a waterproof bottom. The straps are also well padded, and it has reflective strips on each side. I mean, can you say ""perfect""?
"
PatrickYGW,5.0,2019 8 May,"
Excelent backpack for sports athletes! The interior is all made of some plastic material, which is perfect to put dirty clothes and boots. The small pocket is enough for keys, phone and wallet. The ball pocket is very usefull to put dirty boots, and in the boots pocket I actually put dirty clothes. So in the main pocket I leave only clean clothes and towel. It is very confortable for the back as well. The only thing I would add is a chest strap so it wouldn't bounce when walking longer distances in a fast pace. Because of the plastic interior and how easy it is to clean it, I also use it to go to the beach!

Bought for my six year old.  He can easily take his basketball and/or soccer ball to school with lots of room for school books, lunch bags,etc.  I was worried that it would be too big but with straps at shortest position it is perfect fit.  He loves it and it looks durable enough to last a few years.

Seyed Ali Javid,4.0,2022 1 August,"
Right. after 3 years of ownership, I feel like I can finally make a review of this backpack. For some backstory, this backpack has been with me since freshman year and now I’m going into senior year. It’s been to every one of my sporting events, every classroom, been across the country a few times, and much more. There’s 2 main compartments in this bag. One for “shoes” (which I rarely used for said purpose) and another for storing the bulk of your things. This bag doesn’t have a laptop compartment so I have a laptop sleeve for my Mac. My only complaint with the main compartment is that if you have a binder with rubber on the edges (staples binder) then it’ll catch on the material inside which means you have to pull the material or just shove it down. Other than that, it’s fine. The backpack can hold everything you need and still not break your back. The water bottle holders are great. I used one for my bike lock and another to hold my 1L camelback bottle. There’s a compartment on the bottom which can fold out to either hold a ball, helmet or anything you decide. I’ve used it to hold my bike helmet, football, and soccer ball. It was perfect every time. I also do appreciate the rubber like material on the bottom however I found that if scratched on asphalt or any abrasive surface, it starts to peel off and doesn’t stop. The rubber surface is just a film so you can rest the bag on the ground without fear of the bottom getting wet, etc. Great thought, sub par execution. If you wanted you can just put black duct tape over it, but I left mine how it is since I don’t mind that much. On the topic of zippers, they’re some of the best I’ve ever used. Never been stuck or jammed in anyway and they’re always smooth. If adidas makes another version with a padded laptop sleeve and enhanced rubber bottom, I’d 100% buy it again.

william lopez,5.0,2021 29 August,"
So I got my ps4 pro on Friday came it pretty quick I was very surprised when it did how ever when I opened the box the box it self look a hot mess and wasn’t  sure if it was worth the money that I had spent on it but seeing how my old ps4 was having a bit of a fan problem and over heating issue I had no choice but to spend the money and hope that it was worth the buy so after checking it out and making sure nothing wasn’t damaged or broken Whitch it wasn’t I was happy I had plugged it in and started transferring all my data on to the pro and so far I’ve been playing on it for a couple of days no problems yet that I Knw of but it’s nice and quiet and doesn’t sound like a jet about to take off am very happy with this product how ever wasn’t happy that I had to spend the money on it but seeing how it will be a million years before I can get my hands on a ps5 this was as best for an upgrade over all am a satisfied customer and will continue to play my games ☺️Just make sure to ask yourself if you really wanna spend that kind of money for a ps4 pro or if you rather just hold out til you can get a ps5

Phillip Peeler,4.0,2021 14 October,"
Liked quick shipping 7 days early liked that unit was clean and fan was quiet started right up did not like the control the sent it was a nasty gold color dirty and sticky I won’t send back for that but you should expect the same with controller all cables present and working overall very glad the unit was solid so far(3 days in)
"
ANGELA RUSSELL,2.0,2022 30 June,"
I’m hoping the seller or someone will get back to my question on network issues that I left in the questions section… I’m not sure if it’s normal, but the fan is super loud, like obnoxiously loud. Also, form the beginning I have had issues connecting to the PlayStation network. Not Wi-Fi, but PlayStation network. I have synced my clock to the Internet and I have set this as my primary console, but nothing so far has worked. It’s getting worse every day. This last week I have spent probably 30-45 minutes each night just trying to get connected or reconnected to my game. Tonight, I have been trying for an hour to connect and still not successful. That would be frustrating on its own, but I only have an hour to an hour and a half to play each night, so it’s basically worthless to me right now.

Coco nut,5.0,2021 11 June,"
Got my arm twisted into buying a ps4 so I could game with my bf since it's not looking like he'll be getting his ps5 this year. Looked at Walmart where used consoles are at LEAST 700 bucks which is ridiculous alone for 8 year-old tech, used or not. Checked Amazon with low expectations and found this gem at a great price- next lowest was around $600. Not only did this seller ship it immediately to have it arrive at my doorstep a couple days earlier than expected, they even asked which color controller i wanted! My new (used, but I'd never know it) ps4 pro runs perfectly, and the controller has none of those weird drifting issues I've heard about. I would give 10 stars if I could. Thank you!

First off, this got here almost a week early in the original PS4 Pro box which was a nice surprise. No signs of wear on the console, games, or either of the controllers. I have been using it for a few days and have had no issues.

All's well but the only gripe I have is the Japanese message after the Playstation logo on start up and my dvds will not play because the console is region locked.
"
Chris,3.0,2022 9 February,"
•There was a dent on the right corner, and the box was a bit beat up with scratches. That could've been the cause of it.•The ps4 pro had everything but it's own power cord, I had to order one in order to turn it on.
"
NIKOV,5.0,2020 29 June,"
Definitely recommend this product and seller. Just an fyi, Their contact info came in the box and also had a disclaimer that basically said if you had ANY questions do not hesitate to reach out. The first ps4 we got had some kinks and didn't stay on when we inserted a game, but they were more than patient with us on having it replaced. The ps4 pro we have now runs great and is very quiet compared to our regular ps4 and our ps3. Even when the fan runs from a large game it's not very loud. I will say the ps4 pro is a tad bigger than the regular ps4 but it didn't take up any extra space on out tv stand. We absolutely love it!!
"
Davion huell,4.0,2019 8 September,"
Pardon for my late review. I recieve my ps4 pro about a week ago from my courier and everything is perfect so far except for it seems like something is wrong with my controller. If I'm in a menu or something, even just playing a game my cursor just keep scrolling up as if I'm pushing up on the analog stick. This happen only sometime and can be annoying if I'm playing a gun game that require aiming, my character would just constantly be looking up even when I'm trying to center the view to get an accurate aim. I doubt this is the console and more to be the controller issue. Otherwise I'm loving my upgrade from the base ps4 to the pro. The only reason this ain't a 5 star is because of my control. Now I guess I'm gonna have to buy one.
"
Michelle,4.0,2020 12 May,"
Playstation worked great and was packaged nicely. Didnt have a single problem with the product. 4 stars instead of 5 because i went through the trouble to have this delivered to my parents house inatead of mine with the understanding that at the price of 500$ it needed to be signed for upon drop off. Well guess what the ups driver dropped the package on the front step never even knocked on the door. My dad who is ritired watched him pull up drop the package and leave went downstairs thinging it was one of his deliveries to find out it was my playstation 4 pro.
"
S. Warren,5.0,2021 15 April,"
Been happy with PS4.  Sadly after 7 years I came across a usb adapter thought be nice to add  keyboard and mouse to it without changing the only 2 usb; sadly over time because of that stupid adapter my ps4 started having usb problems.  At one point none of the usb worked.  Never again will I do that.  Lasted 7 years till it did that.  So now i have the PS4 Pro it is wonderful has 3 USB Hurray!!!!!
"
Malcolm McDonald,5.0,2021 13 October,"
I will not lie, I was deeply concerned on whether or not this system was actually going to be an authentic PS4, ESPECIALLY when all the instructions/product info was in Spanish! I thought I had been scammed. I’ve had it for almost 3 months now, no issues whatsoever and performs wonderfully. Genuinely impressed.
"
Will Burton,4.0,2019 9 December,"
I purchased the ps4 pro from Maze tech. I'm not sure what model it is.  It has  7215b on the box but has 6.20 firmware on it.  So I really don't know what model it is.  I don't hear the fan but it could be the firmware keeping the fan noise down.  I borrowed minecraft and had freezing and glitches  but it could just be the  game.  I decided to upgrade the firmware to 7.00 which seemed to help. I'll write another review when my order of doom arrives and test it again.  All in all it seems to be a good console.
"
Eddie,4.0,2021 30 May,"

I had issues with ps4 not having video on multiple televisions. However if I could I would give 10 star rating. Absolutely the best customer service I've had possibly ever.
"
Jose,5.0,2021 1 February,"
It works fine. It’s not what I expected but it does do everything it says it will but mind you that all your cords from the system and the tv make it hard to place it in certain spots so you have to accommodate thee area you plan on putting it. Other that great buy. Oh almost forgot the place to hold the games is a little short so the will slip out it you don’t back it up against something.
"
Michael,4.0,2020 6 September,"
Was as shown new in box, not 5 star because the money spent, looks like box was thrown around, beat up and packed with b.s. paper towels, not even the good bubble packaging they have that I get with a $20=-/.But I have a 4k tv bought from W.M., for $200, and it's worth having the smart 4k tv rather then a reg flat screen.

"
Katie Thornton-Wiatt,5.0,2020 7 April,"
Our old PS4 died suddenly, and we are stuck at home due to the COVID019 shelter in place order. We use our PS4 for games and movies, so we were delighted to be able to get one on Amazon that arrived very quickly. We are back to watching our movies and games. This came with 1 PS4 Controller, so if you need more than one controller you will need to purchase the second controller separately. It did come with the appropriate cords and instructions, and was packaged to endure shipping without damage.
"
Mr. Nerdy Dad,4.0,2020 24 July,"
Fan sounds great, which is why we had to replace our old console, and haven't had any issues. The controller pulls to the side which is annoying and sometimes inconvenient, but overall good buy. However, I would have looked at other sellers if I had known there was no warranty available.

Playstation 4 pro delivers .

Eleanor,4.0,2020 28 January,"
The original controller packaged with the console was faulty, however the seller sent a replacement and return label. They have good communication if you are the one to message them. The system itself seems slightly slower than most PS4 Pro consoles, and some minor physical damage can be seen if you look closely. Overall good condition.
"
Lady Jerzy,5.0,2020 5 May,"
The shipping had some problems because of UPS was a little concerned because my shipping box was open when I picked it up from UPS I tested everything the playstation box was not open so I know everything inside was new. I am enjoying my system no complaints as far as the playstation it looks beautiful on my 75 inch 4k tv thank you I'm now playing call of duty.

Console works. Was equally eagar to get an additional controller only to have the R2 trigger fall out immediately after taking it out of packaging. Everything was very poorly wrapped and protected in package I'm amazed the console made it in one piece.
"
Sherman Gee,5.0,2020 23 November,"
I like that the price was very reasonable and the product was everything that they say it was seeing the joy on my grandson face when he plug it up and play the game and go online with his friends was a joy after his other PlayStation was not repairable
"
Joshua C. Perry,4.0,2019 2 November,"
everything was as expected, EXCEPT the controller. I know the seller would likely not know, but the right analog stick is defective and constantly aims upwards, making live-action games near impossible. I am overall satisfied with my purchase, but the issue of having to spend $60 on another controller does bother me.

Came in 2 weeks late , but works and looks good..
"
Benjamin cook,4.0,2020 26 May,"
The product it’s self is amazing but the box that it came in was trashed and there are scuff marks on the interior box. Not enthused about the shipment of an expensive product...
"
Jericho S,5.0,2020 29 October,"
Bought it new. Works like a brand new system. No problems no loud noises. Updated the system and it didn't take long actually id say 10-15 minutes for the 8.00 update. Everything was packaged and individually sealed. Will be purchasing from the seller again in the future.

Eric K. ,5.0,2019 6 November,"
I was late getting a next gen console because I specifically wanted the ps4 pro and was hoping the price would drop faster. But I am very happy with it. I upgraded the hdd right away to a 2tb, and I use the original as external memory. The only thing I wish I could have gotten was an extended warranty like Amazon offers on most of their electronics, but it wasn't an option :/
"
Oni,5.0,2021 15 February,"
It arrived quickly and on time in good condition, very good condition actually I didn't notice it to be any different from a new device. It was packed quite well and contained all items listed.
"
MJ,4.0,2020 11 March,"
PlayStation is always good. But screen glitched out the day I plugged it up so I couldn’t chance it. Sent it back and got another one from elsewhere for cheaper.
"
Lucas,1.0,2020 5 August,"
I have to unfortunately give this listing a 1 star as the item listed is NOT what you're getting.I ordered a NEW 1tb PS4 Pro from HALF TIME. When i got it, the packaging was dirty, but i thought nothing of it. I went to open it and found that the Tamper Sticker (the little clear circle) had clearly been removed and put back on. I again, thought that maybe it had just come off with age.I opened the box and... wow. The controller was disgusting. The stand was a third party stand and was covered in dirt and dust,. The unit itself was scuffed and damaged and also covered in dust.Here's the kicker- THE UNIT WASN'T EVEN A PRO. They shipped me a USED PS Slim in a PS4 pro box, complete with masking tape to keep the cardboard down over the unit. See the images above for proof- The Serial numbers didn't even match. So overall, not very happy with my buying experience. Paid $500 for a use PS4 Slim model, that I would assume probably doesn't even work. I tried to contact the Support number for HALF TIME and guess what- disconnected.👎 I do not recommend buying this from this listing!
"
Christopher,5.0,2020 2 April,"
Great for watching 4k movies, playing games, etc. The user interface is 100% better than the slim i recommend itEdit: I forgot to add that if you go under ps4 settings you can turn on boost mode which is for games that can't be in 4k but it will be given a fps boost
"
Pedrito 2317,5.0,2021 25 April,"

"
FunBags!!!,5.0,2020 14 January,"
Received Brand New unit PS 4 pro with unbeatable price! I was playing throughout the weekend and Im happy with the performance.  HDR makes a lot difference.  GTA5 looks unreal. I pre-ordered street fighter 5 with fighting controllers. I heard PS5 is coming  in few months but I won't be able to spend $500 for the new PS5.
"
Ramona Spruill,5.0,2020 5 May,"
We had a PS4 Slim that has been dying for a few months. Finally got the Pro and the guys in the family notice the difference in graphics and speed. I just like the larger storage. Glad for the upgrade, even though finding an affordable item was a chore.
"
Matt Grindell,5.0,2020 17 September,"
Plugged in and set up great, came with all needed cords and wires, and a pristine controller. Also in the package was a comforting letter from the seller which was greatly appreciated. Packaged and shipped safely, great condition upon arrival. 5/5
"
Nicola LaGreca,5.0,2020 19 April,"
PS4 arrived much earlier than expected. PS4 box was shipped in an unmarked box so as to protect the contents. Worked right out of the box, and have had no issues thus far with long multi-hour play sessions of the FF7 remake. Came with console, controller, cables, headphones, etc. Would highly recommend.

"
jeremy melendez,5.0,2020 22 February,"
Was hesitant on getting this due to the close release of the PS5, though at launch, the ps5 won't have all the new exclusives and third party games being released. So while I wait on that, decided now is a good time to play the arsenal of games the PS4 had in store.

Taylor Marie Stultz,4.0,2020 15 May,"

When with the PlayStation as I’ve had good experience in the past. So far, enjoy everything the pro offers over the slim. Highly also suggest a wall mount that you can buy on Amazon as it makes it very clean and out-of-the-way.

James Alexander,2.0,2020 27 May,"
Obviously was not new. Box was ragged. I should have taken a picture. Controller was no new either the controller was very used. Ended up buying a new one because the one that came with it had issues with the sticks pulling in directions even when not being used. The system istelf has been working fine.Overall i should have just bought new. The system was free and clear of all old info and has been working fine. Just don't advertise new systems if you're going to ship a clearly ragged box, and obviously worn controller.Ordered and recieved feb 2020Update may 2020. They changed the advertisement to used like new. Im happy for that.

The Ps4 Pro came in fine no damages to itself and accessories. But when booting it up it gave me an error saying ""Cant start Ps4. Cannot access system storage."" So i took a look at its hard drive and it was an incompatible Seagram Mobile 1tb HDD which doesn't work with the ps4 pro. I had to put in my old ps4's hardrive to make sure the pro functioned like normal which it did. So total hardware failure when it comes to the HDD the pro came with.

Johnathan Fleming,1.0,2020 21 October,"
The ps4 cane damaged and when taking it out of the box, a piece fell off. We didn’t bother unpacking the rest of what was in the box because it was completely unusable. It was in such bad condition that I had to go back on Amazon and read the description over again just to make sure this wasn’t a refurbished product. I thought maybe I had made a mistake. I’m very good about reading item descriptions for anything I buy. This was a brand new PlayStation 4 pro. We are shipping it back and not sure if we’ll buy another from this company. I hardly ever leave reviews, but this was such a disappointment. I’ve been looking around locally ,and everywhere else is out of stock- even game stop. I’ve bought computers and other tech through Amazon without a problem before.
"
Kindle Customer,5.0,2019 6 August,"

I bought this ps4 for $699 and at that moment it was listed as a ""condition: new"" product. Yet, when receiving it, the coverings are dirty, e.g. the oil in the covering. In addition, no English manual at all and no original box. I feel it is a used product.

Everything Amazon ,1.0,2020 28 December,"
Firstly it arrived several days late which really stunk because it was supposed to get here before Xmas and it was the only gift my gifts got. However we can understand that shipping during this season is unpredictable so that we can forgive. The reason for the rating I gave is because we spent so much money on this console and the seller didn’t even bother to clean it out. It’s making extremely load fan noises which is apparently caused by a dirty fan. So now I have to buy tools to open it up and hope that’s the only problem.

I recieve my ps4 pro about a week ago from my courier and everything is perfect so far except for it seems like something is wrong with my controller. If I'm in a menu or something, even just playing a game my cursor just keep scrolling up as if I'm pushing up on the analog stick. This happen only sometime and can be annoying if I'm playing a gun game that require aiming, my character would just constantly be looking up even when I'm trying to center the view to get an accurate. The only reason this ain't a 5 star is because of my control. Now I guess I'm gonna have to buy one.

Lucifer,1.0,2020 6 May,"
System worked fine. Had a really annoying clicking noise so I took it apart to see what was going on. The Playstation was literally missing parts. It was missing a few screws and a heat pad. No wonder it was making noise. And, of course, I won't be able to get a refund because taking it a part voids any type of warranty. So, if I wouldn't have taken it a part I never would have known what was wrong with it. Now that I have taken it apart, I do know what's wrong with it but I won't be able to get any type of compensation.

The system showed up with some assembly required! The bottom was hanging off and the front face plate is chipped all the way across. It honestly looked as if someone dropped it on the floor and just packaged it up anyway. After plugging it in and it miraculously turns on. Come to find out it doesn’t read ANY disc at all. It plays digital downloads just fine. But can’t recognize any other type of disc. Game, BluRay, and DVD!

Console did not boot up on arrival.  Did some troubleshooting using the Playstation/Sony website to no avail.  Took it into a shop specializing in repairs and it wouldn't boot up for them either.  Watched them reseat the HD to eliminate the simple fixes.  Still doesn't work.  Paid twice market value for a brick.

Console does not function correctly at all - cannot even complete basic setup - and apparently seller didn’t check whether it worked before reselling it. Could not get through setup process, as it kept cutting out every few seconds. Double checked cables, etc to no avail and immense frustration. Extremely disappointed by this experience and wish the seller(s) held themselves to a higher standard.

Bought this system as some entertainment during the Covid19 outbreak. It arrived 3 days earlier than expected, but this supposedly brand new system has a corrupted hard drive. It started off with every game shutting off within 5 minutes of gameplay saying the download was corrupted. I wiped and redownloaded each game - same issue. Finally restarted console and now the console won't boot at all - even in safe mode.

Advertised as Playstation 4 Pro 1Tb Console. Sounds good. I paid full price for a Playstation 4 Pro and I got a playstation slim 1 Tb Console in the mail. (The cheaper version of the playstation). Not a good look, either this is false advertising or simply a mistake. Either way its unacceptable.

I got the used ps4 like it was brand new.Came with everything controller was good power cord was cord was good. Now if you playing on a 4k tv or monitor and don’t have a hdmi that supports your resolution his doesn’t sadly. So I had to order a new one other then that you should get it.The purpose for me to get this ps4 was to jailbreak It. I ordered it my ps4 version was on 8.50 so I got luck there. Cause it doesn’t tell you the firmware version on there page at least I didn’t seee. So order at your own risk if that’s your purpose.
"
xArkSlade08x,5.0,2020 29 May,"
The console is great, beautiful design, the controller feels good in hands. The graphics of the games are awesome in a 4K TV.Got a great deal on this and felt it was well worth the money spent. My only complaint is that this, like other PS consoles, lacks backwards compatibility. They should all have that ability.They should update firmware to be able play games PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation 3.Update firmware for external hard drives with expanded storage space (20+TB) and be able to use external hard drive hubs too. Hope they can fix that before they release PlayStation 5 consoles.

Brock Moore,1.0,2020 23 December,"
Not much to say. I’ve had it for 2 years upgrading from a regular ps4. While the original model never gave me issues, the pro has been nothing but faulty. It wouldn’t turn on all the way earlier this year, so I sent it in for repairs. Now it’s malfunctioning again. Only this time, I’m suffering more than just an inability to turn on.Sometimes it refuses to turn on. When it does, the menu lags pretty severely. Performance regarding frame rate, clarity, and basic functionality of games I run on it has suffered immensely. Stuff that ran easily on my ps4 struggles on the pro, often crashing it.All around this has been my worst console experience, only made worse by Sony’s infamously unhelpful support. I’d take a downgrade at this point.

I was very anxious and excited about buying my own PS4, despite it being a last gen model refurbished. My biggest concern when receiving the PS4 was the possibility of it not powering on at all or being damaged when it was transported and delivered to my address. However, that concern immediately vanished after the PS4 turned on and was functioning perfectly without any issues. I really appreciate the time and effort that went into packing the PS4 as everything was well cushioned and sealed. Not mention it arrived earlier  than expected, which was nice! Overall, I’m extremely satisfied with the PS4, and would recommend others to buy from this seller! (Will add pictures later)

I bought this brand new. A little confused about the ""new"" part. I noticed spanish on the box and manual wasn't inside of plastic packaging also was in spanish. Box was pretty beat up and seal was cut already. The console/controller look clean feel really nice no dust, wires and cables look original. I noticed the warranty stickers in the back of the console were crooked. Also in unboxing videos that playstation included stickers. I didn't find any.

It's a PS4 it's good-Main issue is not being able to COPY Game to another ext drive rather than just transferring.Also most Bluetooth headsets are NOT supported-ProsThe pro itself is great. It shows well in games like DS3, Bloodborne, borderlands 3 and a lot of other graphical power house games. It's also more stable from its base counterpart from what I've experienced.

"
Aaron Yun,5.0,2021 4 April,"
I have owned every home Sony console at one point or another in my life. This generation with the PS4 has been a great one. The library is stacked with a plethora of options for all types of gamers whether you're doing it casually or are hardcore. Titles ranging from Blockbuster AAA games to smaller scale indie experiences. Admittedly I think I've played less than the PS2 and PS3 eras, but I think the overall quality of the PS4 library is more well-rounded than those two. I've transitioned mainly to gaming on PC, but will play games on my PS4 that are exclusive to the console whether they are first or third-party games.The model I received was the silent revision (CUH-7215B) where the Pro no longer sounds like a jet-engine under load, you can still hear the fans a bit, but it's not bothersome. The Pro itself is a nice incremental iteration on the original model. You have access to slightly higher visual fidelity in certain games especially in ""4k"", and sometimes a performance mode. With PS5 now in the fold, it's safe to say that this model of the PS4 will slowly fade into obscurity, but the slim models should continue to be available for awhile before we completely transition into the next generation. Once the PS5 has a more robust library, I'll consider picking one up. But right now the PS4 still has a very strong library of games that I may continue to explore over time. I just bought Sakura Wars on sale and may pick up 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim at some point (Niche but loved titles by their respective communities, that are probably trapped on the PS4). Installing an SSD will help speed up install and load times for most games (Especially in MH:World and Spider Man) if you’re willing to spend a bit of extra cash.If you can get a hold of a Pro around retail price somewhere or used in good condition I highly recommend it, especially for collectors.Edit: This review was written about 2 years after the purchase of this console. It’s held up really well, granted I’m not a power user and this isn’t my main  means of gaming. Just wanted to put that out there.

Läuft.Geliefert wurde eine PS4Pro mit 1TB HDD, Netzkabel, Micro-USB Kabel (nicht Original aber vergleichbar, glaub von Samsung) und ein Controller, der zwar stark benutzt (glänzende Handflächenhörner) aber vom Tastengefühl keinen Unterschied zu meinen Neu gekauften  PS4Pro Controllern haben (Akku habe ich getauscht).Die PS4Pro hat an der Unterseite an einer Stelle, von ca. 10cm Durchmesser, leicht andere Oberflächenfarbe (nicht im Kühlkörper/ Proz Bereich).Kühlkörper habe ich gereinigt und Lüfter von Dreck befreit. Dem Prozessor Ark4 WärmeLeitPasste spendiert (im Vergleich zu vorher, ist der Lüfter wesentlich leiser. Vorallem war der Proz nicht Flächendeckend mit WLP versehen...). Die PS4 ist offenbar aus einem Nichtraucher Haushalt. In den Controller habe ich einen neuen Akku eingesetzt.Kann bisher keinen Unterschied zu meiner anderen PS4 feststellen.Top.

Sir Faieq Ahmed,5.0,2020 13 September,"
This is my 3rd Ps4. I've had the original & the slim before this. I've noticed many differences & its all good & better changes. The major change which i really like is the fan. Before with the original I use to get the jet engine noise really loud. Now the noise is once in a while when you start game. Bare in mind, my Ps4's I've always kept it clean from it getting it dusty. I actually hoover/vacuum the side & back every three months. The slim didn't have a optical cable port but the original & the pro does have it. Also it being 1TB really helps to have alot more games installed. Another things would be the 'Cache' that builds up in system. This did have a effect on the free space on the original, but with the Pro version, not an issue. As you can see from my photo, before I had it horizontally flat out on the chest draw. Its about 3.4 inches thick laying flat meaning it did cover a bit of my t.v screen when I sat down. I decided to up it vertically by getting the stand for it. There is a option for you to game/watch in 1080p, but honestly when it comes to graphics I can't really tell the difference form my last ps4's as its all the same to me.Abit of information I learned about the console is that, it needs air to be flowing. So if you have the ps4 trapped with no air to be released behind it or if you're in a small room then it would make loud noise as the fan would need to work extra harder to get rid of thr hot air. If your room temperature is fine & mild then its fine. Just clean it from getting dusty.

Liked that it work's with my new MSI Monitor 34inch Ultra wide. 100hrtzBloody awesome having a 4K Console that works with my monitor.last monitor was a little bit iffy with it.( Samsung)Doom Eternal and 4K PS4 and Ultra wide makes for a fun time.No need to look all the way over the other side of the screen.Since it's nice solid monitor at 34 inch's.

Purchased a PS4 Pro from these guys, it arrived super quickly and was packaged well. I had a slight issue with the controller which was rectified immediately! (They sent me a replacement) I couldn't recommend these guys enough. Super happy, thank you!!

Mr Callagher ,4.0,2021 11 October,"
Was an amazing product however eventually died as games wouldn't load tidy, the interface was laggy af and just couldn't handle being used that much which in my opinion is stupid as you buy a console to play it but other than that the delivery was awsome and I've had some fond memories with this piece of hardware for a while and that's all I could ask for I guess
"
Chris Ramsay,5.0,2022 19 April,"
Fantastic all around! The delivery timeline was amazing received it within 3 days! The controller was flawless it like using a brand new one! The PS4 did have a little mark on the top of it but to be honest you would only see it if you were actually looking for it. All in all in very happy!

The Ps4 looked advertised as new and in original box, But came in plane cardboard box And you could tell it was used, the controller had all the barcode information worn away.

Terrenz Luong,5.0,2022 11 February,"
I wasn’t too sure whether buying consoles on Amazon was legit and trust worthy but this seller made it fast and provided support 100% of the way. If you are looking to get a console I highly recommend this seller💯

TheDirectorsOfGaming,4.0,2020 4 May,"
Overall the PS4 is an amazing console and the PS4 Pro is no exception and I would definitely recommend it as your first choice.However as a previous PS4 owner, I had imagined lightning fast menu load speeds in terms of the Playstation Menu, store and general navigation. However it really isn't much better than the regular PS4 unfortunately. So don't make the same mistake as I did and assume that the sometimes slow load speeds of the menu would be rectified in the PS4 Pro because it really isn't, it's more for in-game quality and is generally recommended for PSVR.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 26 February,"

"
Gilwil,4.0,2020 13 May,"
Well packaged and delivered on time.I am new to gaming - getting into this during current lockdown.Ideal for my requirements but can’t comment re how it compares with competitors or previous PS4 as have never had any.Only disappointment when opening the box was that none of the booklets ie Instructions, safety and guarantee were printed in English only Nordic countries languages for some reason. However once I contacted supplier I was forwarded a download with promise of follow up booklets in English by post.
"
Mr. Goodchild,4.0,2021 6 May,"
There was a discrepancy with the actual condition and what it was described as, and a faulty controller, but that was made right by the seller.  Happy now.  Decent purchase.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 The console didn’t come with the right power cable, I had to buy a figure 8 power cable, no usb charging cable. It’s constantly overheats and prompts me to turn off, the fan noise is a nightmare. Some minor cosmetic damage here and there but it plays fine. The controller is ok as well. Overall I am not satisfied with the product, I will have to return it.

"
Andrew,4.0,2020 20 February,"
Later model of PS4 bought late 2019 runs quietly and has no issues,  shame it doesn’t have a 4K Blu-ray Player which would have been feasible since even the Xbone S has one so that and the fact many game’s including Bloodborne do not benefit at all really from the upgrade I wouldn’t upgrade from the base PS4 unless you have a 4K HDR display and can’t wait till PS5.
"
Metjana,1.0,2022 13 September,"
This product is not in the real box and it is used. We bought for a new product. So we want to return it and get a full refund for it.
"
A guy,5.0,2019 14 October,"
Well this has been a pleasant surprise, I came from a 2013 PS4 and I've noticed a huge improvement not a lot but pretty big! The Pro is huge in comparison to the og PS4 I recently got a 4K TV and an Xbox one x and wanted to update my PlayStation too, the price is still a tad high for something that came out in 2016 it gets very warm while gaming in 4K idk if it's my LG 4K TV but playing Red dead redemption 2 seems a bit washed out it may be my HDR settings because on my one x it's crystal clear anyways I definitely recommend this awesome console!!!
"
Artin,5.0,2020 25 May,"
Came on time, all the bits and bobs were there, super easy to set up especially if you’ve  owned other ps consoles in the past. Actual console is just a beefier, faster version of the old one with more hard drive space, so really is a win win. Especially now games like warzone, take up so much disk space you’ll need it. Noticeable difference in Video quality much better, also a lot quieter that older PS4. Would recommend however could also wait for ps5 if your not desperate ?
"
George Patient,5.0,2020 11 September,"
During lockdown I had been using an original PS4 Console which was about 6 years old and needless to say, it had been well used.It was becoming a bit outdated for my 4K TV and was a bit slow so I decided to upgrade to the PS4 Pro.With the Pro, I noticed a massive difference... the picture quality was great and the speed was impressive. I am now really looking forward to the release of the PS5.
"
Elli Yadrychnikova,5.0,2021 30 September,"

christine spurrier,5.0,2020 8 May,"
I got this as my fiancé’s pc died and he likes gaming so decided till we could get the bits he needs for it to get a console and he loves it so much he nearly got rid of his pc. Even though it said 2 day delivery it actually arrived the next day which was brilliant and the range of games for it is brilliant the last console I had was a ps2 so to see the difference in the graphics was amazing
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 21 July,"
I bought this on behalf of my flatmate, but since they've let me use it I've been very impressed. I'm an Xbox user myself, and althought the graphics on the One X are noticeably better, I'm loving the PS4 exclusives like Spiderman - I've been convinced to save up for a PS5 at some point as well as a Series X! My flatmate also bought an external Samsung T5 SSD, which definitely improves loading times for it.
"
VC,1.0,2021 22 December,"
I bought a second hand PS4 from this company. It was described as being in Like New condition. It arrived soon enough, and everything seemed okay. Everything was in the box, and it looked okay. I then plugged everything in and tried to turn it on, and nothing happened! I used to own the same type of PS4 years ago, so I know what is supposed to happen. The console they sent me does not work. I am furious and I am going to do what I can to get a refund, but, I'm not optimistic about that happening. The first thing I have decided to do is leave this review. People deserve to know that something like this might happen. Do not buy from this company! I spent hundreds of pounds on equipment that does not work, and I don't want that to happen to anyone else.

Nathan,2.0,2021 12 September,"
i sold the Launch pro model and went for the 7200 off amazon to reduce the fan noise because people have assured me it is quieter, however there is literally no difference in the fan noise between the 2 models when everybody tries to tell you there is.. i opened mine up cleaned the heatsink, cleaned the fan, replaced the thermal paste and the thermal pads and it still appears to be just as loud/Noisy.

The item I ordered came early and got everything I ask for I would order again the only problem I had was who deliverd it which was DPD there didn’t even get the write address but luckily there is honest people about so I got it but this was not the company’s fault I ordered it from
"
Rob,3.0,2020 12 January,"
Pleased with the PS4 Pro it’s a great piece of kit can’t fault it.  5 stars.The packaging though is pretty poor and that’s being kind. 2 stars.  A cardboard box that was wet and torn.  The filling of the box to prevent items becoming damaged was a folded piece of cardboard.  My items box was damaged.Luckily there was no damage to the PlayStation.Great item, packaging need improvement.
"
Mad Mark,5.0,2019 12 October,"
Had my old, first generation PS4 for six years but, for the second time, it started spitting out my discs so thought it was time for a upgrade. Should've got the Pro years ago!! Much more room for storage! Much more powerful! I only have a 24 inch 1080p TV and the visual quality is a vast step up (no doubt even more so on a 4K.) The PS4 Pro has been worth every penny. Highly recommended!
"
Christophe Di Bartolo,5.0,2021 13 May,"
Just upgraded to PRO. Lovin' it so far. The performance and visual aspects increase are quite big. I am not in a rush to switch to PS5
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 5 June,"
Absolute excellent!It's a great console. Quiet, fast and looks sleek and good.Despite not having a 4K TV I went with the Pro due to the extra 500gb of memory. And it's worth it. With games like Modern Warfare taking 128gb I can see how it fills up fast!Would 100% recommend this console.

Terry Miles,3.0,2020 29 April,"
Item arrived very quickly. Thanks. So no complaints regarding the supplier but the console itself is such a disappointment. Games take an age to install from discs. Even worse some insist you download and install updates before playing. Just tedious. I can’t remember having all this trouble with the PS3. Very unhappy.
"

"
Gary1975,5.0,2020 8 February,"
This is my first console in years,so for a complete novice, I love it! For me this is a big step up, the graphics are amazing, with a huge selection of games, and I've just been introduced to VR which this console can do, and it blew me away. So I give this full stars!

"
Kindle Customer,5.0,2020 16 August,"
Great bit of kit, just as each & every rendition has been a step or two, above the previous system, this is good, but you need to choose the best games that you have a interest in.
"
Louis,2.0,2021 27 August,"
The product it's self is good however the delivery driver dropped the package over a 5ft gate instead of delivering it to the door. This caused minor cosmetic damage to the product , fortunately the console and controller function ok
"

I know its not the PS5 but my son absolutely loves this playstation 4 PRO... loads of storage so will own for a long time
"
Val,1.0,2020 1 April,"
I will describe my experience with the product in detail:1. Tried to connect JBL Boombox as a speaker. Device not supported2. Tried to connect Bose Soundsport headphones. Device not supported3. Tried to connect my Logitech MX Master mouse. Device not supported.4. Connected my Apple Magic Mouth - worked, wooow. Only the first time though. After reboot the Magic Mouse is in the list of devices and when I press connect it times out. If I try to delete it from the list of devices, the PS4 crashes and asks me to send a bug report. Really? Rebooted, tried again and PS4 completely froze. I had to force-reboot it. Amazing experience...For people wondering which external devices to buy - buy only cable connected devices, whether it's a keyboard, mouth or speaker. Also, google before buying devices whether they're supported.Shame on Sony for not supporting such common and basic external devices.
"
mrs,1.0,2021 25 January,"
I purchased this console as New, it was a gift for my husbands christmas but which sadly did  not play games and after a couple of hours didn't go into safe mode and a few more hours later didn't even come up on the screen.  He contactedd sony in the hope of getting a fix for it but was instead told that the console was over two years old, had run out of warranty and was preowned............was furious as I paid £409.  for what I thought was a new unit, there was nothing on the amazon page to indicate this was secondhand, however, they promptly refunded my money.  The seller was Monster Bid Ltd.  The product had it be new would probably have been fine.

Malick Doucouré,1.0,2020 14 August,"
I’ve been a great amazon customer for years, probably spent thousands so I’m really disappointed to have received what feels like a faulty product.I bought this PS Pro 6 weeks ago and it’s already broken. Six weeks. I bought it with a game and a controller from amazon, the game was fine but the controller was faulty and immediately unusable. Amazon have me a refund for this, I should’ve sent back the PlayStation too. It was a bit weird but I don’t complain if it’s not necessary so I went on with it, only for the HDMI port to have stopped working on me 6 weeks later.Really really disappointed, I think I might go to GAME or someone other than amazon for my big purchases now since they never disappoint.

it seems to be over heating and is very noisy and would not be surprised if it broke down any minute. Sometimes it doesn't turn on when its supposed to. The HDMI cable doesn't seem to connect to my new TV very well and also the controller wire doesn't work. Not very impressed at all.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 6 November,"
Takes the PS4 and adds more options and combustibility to your games, Say you prefer Performance over graphics or maybe you'll happily take a hit to the frame rate for the game to like prettier.. This console has you sorted.
"
Pedro,1.0,2021 13 December,"
I would like to inform Amazon that the console controller is not in proper condition - PS4. In addition to wear marks, the button on the left-hand side does not function correctly. I would like to have the remote control replaced as soon as possible. I remember that your information on this item was that it was in excellent condition.

I Bought a brand new PS4 Pro and after less than 56 hours playtime, the right analog stick started to drift upwards making every game unplayable. The controller is not stuck, offset or anything but seems to be an internal issue.It's too late to get a refund as i bought it three months ago having only used it a few times during that period.

I would recommend you buy this product from another seller, I have had my console for less than a year (August 2019 to now to be exact) and the noise coming from the fan is absolutely ridiculous, I can’t even concentrate on anything unless I have music or my headset blasting in my ears!

The Chinese/English language on the box had me worried for a second, but it is the same quality PS4 Pro one would purchase brand new at any electronics store in Canada (if they were no longer discontinued). Works fine as it should and it definitely plays well in 4K HDR (and supersampling mode if you have a lower quality TV). The pricing is indeed over the top, but you will get your money's worth.

patralink,5.0,2020 4 August,"
I am a clean freak and have used many different mops over the years.  This is the best mop I've ever used and I love it.  It's the spinning action that makes it so great.  When you put the mop in the soap and water you then activate the spinner (think salad spinner) with your foot and all the excess water comes out of it.  The floor dries quicker.  Also the mop head is substancial and does a super job cleaning.  Evidence is in the dirty water you pour out of the bucket at the end.  People have complained abou the handle being too short.  That's because it is lengthened at both ends.  Once you know this you can make it the proper length.  If you lengthen only at one end of the handle it will be very short.

I purchased these as a replacement for the mopping pads that were included when I first bought the mop as a set at Costco; all though these are a little different in color from the original ones that were included with the mop, the quality is still great! To clean them, I throw them in a quick clean cycle in my washer!

"
dace,2.0,2022 31 July,"
This item is not interchangeable with the OCedar mop head with the single spin chamber.  The mounting bracket on the mop head is too large and so will not fit.
"

Kellie,2.0,2022 24 June,"
These mop heads are much thinner than the ones being sold last year. When mopping these mopheads are extremely thin, barely cover the red triangle portion of the mop which kept scratching the floor. Defintely not the same quality. Will not purchase again.

Sarah Scott,5.0,2020 13 March,"
I have been in love with the Ocedar spin mop for about 2 years now. I actually own 2 of the sets. The only downfall was, there is no physical store anywhere near me that sells the replacement heads. Product was as expected (though I always love a new head!) Price is reasonable given the convience of online ordering and was at my door in 3 days (late weekend ordering). 5 stars for this Product and overall brand
"
Costum,5.0,2021 19 August,"

"
Savana Bishop,3.0,2021 10 August,"
This product is okay. It works well on my mop, but it seems like it doesn't get clean after one use. I throw it in the washing machine and let it air-dry, but it always seems to have hairs, lint, etc, still stuck in it. I usually opt for a Swiffer instead.
"

"
jdial2007,5.0,2020 12 March,"
I had bought a replacement head at Walmart, and it must have been defective. It wouldn't stay on my mop no matter how hard we tried to make it. It would snap in, and the second the weight of the water was in, it fell off. These are exactly what I needed for my OCedar spin mop! They're just like the original, and about $3ea cheaper than in store!
"
Brenda,5.0,2021 7 February,"

"
Sue,5.0,2021 18 February,"
I really like that I can switch out mop heads for different jobs and that spinning the mop helps me control how much water I use on the surface.
"
hannahRAWR,3.0,2021 1 January,"
I've found that these heads do not have enough fiber on them to clean the floors without the plastic scraping and having to stop and readjust. I have also found that the debris is hard to come out even after multiple washes. They look worn and dirty quickly and at the rate that you would need to purchase new heads, you might be better off investing in a different mop or method.
"
SHELLY Elderdice,5.0,2021 12 May,"

LoveTheMidniteSunAK220,1.0,2018 12 January,"
I must say that I was more then just a tad bit disappointed with the mop heads I received. Under no circumstances do these mop heads appear to be genuine O-Cedar mop heads. When I purchased the O-Cedar Mop and bucket I was utterly amazed as to how well made the mop and the bucket was made. The first time I used the mop and bucket set I couldn't believe how well the mop absorbed so I got on Amazon and bought the Pack of 3 EasyWring Spin Mop Refill that claims it's made by O-Cedar. It took me a few months before opening the package simply because the original mop head was so well made there was no reason for me to open it. When I first opened the bag I thought for sure Amazon had sent me the wrong mop head, the mop was so poorly put together I thought that maybe there was just one in the bag that was just a fluke but all 3 were pure garbage. The mops were not very absorbent, whenever you pushed the mop across the floor the plastic that the mop is attached to scratched across the floor as if there was no mop attached. I am really disappointed with what I got. I am now back to using the original mop head till I can figure out where I can buy a mop head that is a genuine O-Cedar. My honest opinion is that the package of 3 that I received is not an O-Cedar it's something else inside an O-Cedar bag. How can I order new mop heads if I don't know that the advertisement is truthful or not? Any ideas?

pattyb,4.0,2017 1 July,"
I liked these pretty much, but when they get grungy from mopping floors, they don't hand-wash very well.  Even with Oxy-clean and Tide, they wouldn't whiten up.  And though it says you can machine wash them, my machine is too new for me to have these plastic triangle things banging around in the washtub.  But, still, a good product.
"
Susan Weber,5.0,2019 1 July,"
I've been shopping Amazon for everything lately looking for ways to save money and this is just such a purchase. Where I get the O cedar replacement heads, they go for $7.00 buying these they price out to $5.00 per head. 3 total. No noticeable difference than the ones from the store.

An acquaintance who does housekeeping showed me her O-Cedar EasyWring Microfiber Spin Mop which she loves and swears by.  (I ordered one myself.  It is a marvel.)  She mentioned she was having difficulty locating the mop refill locally, so I ordered these as backup (and gave her one of them).

The O'Cedar mop and spin bucket is awesome.  Keep the mop heads dry after cleaning. The replacements are snap on and great once they get funky
"
lulu,5.0,2018 19 May,"
This o-cedar spin mob is the absolute best - we have luxury vinal plank floors, similar to wood, but waterproof as we have two small dogs; anyway the O-cedar mop is the best for keeping the floor clean.

"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2020 15 February,"
The replacement heads don't work as well as the original. It's almost like the cotton threads aren't long enough. The plastic head is always hanging up on the floor.

Despite rinsing and hanging to dry quickly after issuing it still stinks after only using once. For the cost of each pad that becomes to expensive! However, It does pick up and clean floors well.

Amazon Customer,2.0,2018 21 May,"
The quality of this three pack was not nearly as good as the previous four pack I purchased.  My cleaning lady was very disappointed in this latest shipment. They are flimsy and do not appear to be washable.  Unfortunately, I was not told of her dislike until today.  I purchased these for our home in Pennsylvania, and I live in Arkansas. I have never been unhappy with anything I have bought o Amazon,  Not sure about the process to return.  Please advise.
"

"
mia ochoa,3.0,2018 14 July,"
These are a waste of time, but i had already purchased these before my new bigger better spin mop was given to me. This mop just seems to be too small for the mopping i need to do.
"
Shana Timothy,5.0,2018 30 April,"
These things sure take a beating and do a good job getting in between crevices where a flat mop cannot.
"

"
Melissa F,1.0,2021 30 September,"
These do not fit! They are not a genuine O-Cedar item. I missed the return window as I didnt need to replace the one I had been using. But then while it was washing, a mess was made so I opened these up. That's when I realized they were not true O-Cedar and they didn't fit. In the trash they go. Don't waste your money.
"

 Not very satisfied with this product the mop just got stuck all together first time using it and it looks horrible as you can see in the video and the pictures not satisfied at all
"
Jess44,2.0,2018 19 April,"
Had purchased these last year and the one I bought before were more fluffy and maintained the fluffiness when wet. These that I recently purchased became very stringy and had to be thrown out after about 3 uses when they usually last longer.  Total waste. Hopefully the quality will improve again.

Clari,2.0,2018 22 April,"
Does the job, but compared to the original mob, these are super thin and light, lack friction because of this. I wish they were just like the first mop head. In the picture, the original is the left one, the one on the mop is this product.

"
barbclay,1.0,2018 3 June,"
Wasn't sure if I'd even like this mop when I bought refills, but the mop has been great!  Very easy to replace/refill.  I love that it spins extra water out so that the floor (esp wood) doesn't get too wet.  Nice concept.  However, these refills are NOT the same as those that came with the mop.  Very thin & stringy, I would NOT purchase these refill mop heads!
"
ACast6,1.0,2018 19 January,"
These are not the same as the original mop. It’s  so thin and nothing compared to the quality of the one the bucket system comes with. I purchased them because they are the “Amazon Recommended” the is the first item I purchase and have been disappointed with.
"
Madeline Acevedo,1.0,2021 6 June,"

"
curlyq,1.0,2018 20 March,"
Nothing like the mop head that came with the mop.  The strings ball up and we can't even mop with it.  Not sure if we can order something similar that came with the actual mop.  If not, we will have to just trash the current mop and bucket.  No way can we use these.
"
MJ Alfaro,1.0,2018 7 February,"
I’m extremely disappointed in this product. The thread is very this and long which makes it very difficult to mop. The one that came with the mop is nice and fluffy so the actual mop doesn’t touch the floor. If I would’ve known I would’ve bought a generic brand. Do not recommend it.
"
Cathryn D.,1.0,2018 17 February,"
The quality of these are terrible. The mop yarn is flimsy and much thinner than the normal o-cedar mop head.  It was so thin and flimsy that it was getting caught up underneath and the plastic was scraping against my floor. I do not recommend purchasing as it was a poor, cheap imitation.
"
D,1.0,2018 9 September,"
JUNK!!  The original heads with the mop were good. There are useless.  Flop over exposing the frame and scratching the floor.  And costs too much to bother returning.  DONT"" BUY. Too bad no zero for evaluation.
"
R. Stirewalt,1.0,2018 27 March,"
They suck!  I was so disappointed. They are not the mop  you buy in the store. You have to work twice as hard to clean because they are so thin with material. Buy the ones in the store.these are not worth it.
"
Laurie lomillo,1.0,2020 28 February,"
Worst mop ever if you live in a 4x4 space that’s all it’s good for then the mop head goes flat
"
psl,1.0,2018 4 June,"
Returned them.  They are not the same quality as what you buy in a retail store.  The fibers are much thinner and I returned them.
"
CHAD G POST,1.0,2019 7 November,"
Not a O-Cedar product, cheap knock off in an unmarked clear plastic bag, the material is light weight and cheap. look elsewhere.
"
ED,1.0,2017 4 September,"
We thought these refills would work but they do not wring water well and hard to dry wood flooring. Appear to be different in material compared to the original mops. Almost like turning to mush when wet and bad absorption.
"
jtounurse,1.0,2018 9 March,"
These are terrible!!!!! Nothing like what came with the mop. They look fine, but when placed in water they string to strings that don’t clean at all!!!! Where are the ones that came with the mop!?!??

I got these replacement heads for my new O'Cedar spin mop.  The substitute heads got mixed reviews but the O'Cedar heads were rated far superior and were only a little more money.  I go for quality.

I have a luxury vinyl floor, and used a dry pad, followed with by a wet pad, but always got streaks. I noticed my sister in law using the O cedar mop, and thought no way. I reluctantly bought one and couldn’t be happier. No streaks, and cleans great! Have extra pads on hand. Just toss them  into the laundry and reuse.

We ordered this to use with the Bissell Spot Clean Pro Portable Deep Cleaning machine for multi purpose use. The Spot & Stain with Oxy worked great to remove light stains on our cream colored microfiber sofas, for spot cleaning entry rugs and kitchen runner, on our vehicle floors & mats, upholstered bar stool fabric, and carpeted stairs. Arrived promptly. A small amount goes a long way with this cleaning solution you mix with water. Have a sensitive nose and found the scent to be mild, not overbearing, pleasant compared to many others. Would purchase again and recommend!
"
S. Pappas,5.0,2022 19 October,"
I own a few STRs and often have spot cleaning that is necessary when people spill things which became far too frequent and I got tired of dragging out the big shampooer ever week so I got a Bissell handheld. I was wondering if it would really work very well since there was not hot water used but when with this product its amazing. This cleaner takes out 95% of all the stains we've had including gummy bears ground into the carpet.
"
Christine,4.0,2022 25 October,"
I used this one time and realize that using white vinegar, baking soda and dawn dish soap (occasionally) works better than this product to clean. It's nice, but I think it's cheaper and better to use natural products, but that's my opinion.

Redneckyup,4.0,2022 4 July,"
I bought this unit for my RV. By choice, I live in it. It is a 1995. I bought this for the upholstery and carpet. Probably never been deep cleaned before. I have used multiple carpet cleaners over the years and IMO the concentrated cleaner you use is very important. Though the Bissell cleaner works fine, I have found 5 guys upholstery cleaner and Oreck are the best I have used so far.  The primary reason I write this review is concerning the sprayer. Obviously the sprayer should spray in a fan like design and not squirt. Mine began to squirt two streams. One on each side. After reading questions and reviews I found that this was not uncommon with many returning the unit. I looked closely at my spray nozzle and saw a very tiny white spec in the center. At first I thought this must be part of the design. I then took a toothpick and flicked it out. The spray function then fanned as it should have in the first place. I figured the white spec must have been a remnant from the manufacture of the solution tub. Anyway, the unit works fine now. This is just my second day using it and I have a lot of square feet of upholstery, carpet and yes carpeted ceiling to clean so I will try and update this review once I am done.
"
CalvinL,5.0,2022 3 October,"
This is actually the best Bissell solution I’ve used. It’s more effective at removing scents than the urine remover. I primarily use this for my cats messes but occasionally for my drunk friends sleeping on my couch.

My saving grace used with my bissell upholstery cleaning machine. I have a cream couch with 2 toddlers, 2 cats, 2 dogs and a husband who loves eating snacks on the couch. It’s the only reason I get compliments on how clean the couch is!! The smell is clean and not over bearing or bothersome to my allergies either.

Just used this with my Bissell machine, and it did a fine job cleaning stains and other spots in my carpet.Would definitely suggest you keep this around along with soap to clean the carpet when you need to. Bissell product line is excellent. Glad I went with them.
"
Jennifer Mitten,5.0,2022 6 August,"
I got this for my little green machine because me and my kid are messy sometimes. We've spilled milk and formula on our new fabric couch that's a taupe color. My last straw was when I spilled Kool aid. This cleaning solution did not change any color of the fabric, smells like a weird Kool aid itselfwhich is kind of good, and easily cleans like it should.  I'll definitely buy more when I run out. I have also used it on a bean bag and spots on an area rug, both got clean easily.

TJ Mucha,4.0,2022 10 February,"
An ink pen leaked onto the couch, leaving what looked like seven stars in a constellation, with a few shooting stars.  I used this formula in a Bissell handheld portable wet/dry vac.  The stain was slowly coming out, with repeated attempts to remove it.  I think it was the peroxide in the Oxiclean in the formula that made my skin burn, where I'd had a couple of those winter-dry-skin cracks on my hands.  I took the cushion outside and hosed it down until no more soap bubbled up out of the cushion.  I'm glad I was the one to feel that sting, rather than our puppy or today's 5 year old visitor.  So, I'd say for stubborn but gradually lightening stains, it's wise to rinse this product off between attempts to remove a really bad ink stain.  This product removed an old dog urine stain from the carpet with only one attempt.  Same with a greasy, black stain out of the fairly light colored carpet by the front door.  Gone on the first attempt.
"
dp,5.0,2022 17 July,"
we don't walk on the carpet with shoes. when i need the cleaner, it is for a spill or annual deep clean. this has worked well on a lot of stuff. once had a digiorno pizza upside down and while that took a lot of time, and the pro told me good luck, it did come out with patience (red dye in food can be a nightmare). i will continue to buy this.

Dtobaru,5.0,2022 19 January,"
Had a nasty spill on the carpet in my mini-van, and had tried many other products to get the stain and smell out, but to limited success.  Bought this oxy cleaner as my last ditch effort to purge the van of the awful smell/stain, and to my surprise, it worked very well.  I used a portable rug cleaner, made sure the water was 130 degrees (the max temp. for the device), sprayed the Oxy cleaner on the carpet, scrubbed, let is sit for awhile, then vacuumed the excess.  Just the first pass alone showed it made a huge dent in both the stain and the smell.  Two more repeated passes reduced the stain by 95% plus and completely eliminated the odor.  There seemed to be a minimum of residue remaining, though having a quality vacuum cleaner designed for such purposes is equally important (used the Hoover Spotless Mini Carpet-Pet Cleaner).I would prefer if they could make the product without any perfumes (I am assuming there is something added) and that it was on the pricey side as I went through two bottles quite rapidly.  I would suggest making a larger economical size.In the end, this is now my go to deep carpet cleaner, especially for vehicles.
"
Cathy B.,5.0,2022 29 July,"
There is nothing wrong with the product, cleans up my pet’s mess nicely. However, this delivery came under my husbands name, not mine. I don’t know how that happened since we do not share Amazon accounts. Had this been  a gift… yikes.

Robert T.,5.0,2022 28 March,"
I bought this along with the Bissell spot cleaner machine, and I am very glad I did.  The 8 oz. bottle of cleaner that comes with the Bissell spot cleaner is used up fast, so you really need to buy this larger bottle too.  The scent is nice and is easy to apply and remove (only a small fraction of the cleaning solution applied can be vacuumed up, and I think that is why the cleaned surface stays wet for longer than expected).  If possible, clean the item and let it dry overnight, and it should be dry that next day.

We tried many things to get the yellow pet stains out of our beige carpet.This product really works! The stains have not returned, either. Our house looksso much cleaner.
"
Mystic,5.0,2020 18 April,"
I’m not sure why all these people posting reviews think your suppose to just dump the entire dang thing in the machine.... I dunno what machines other folks are using but I have a spot bot, with little line indicators on the water container dohickey for how much water to add, and how much solution to add. And lemme tell ya, you only need a small portion of what it calls for as long as ur water is hot from the tap. I’m talking like.. 1/4 to maybe even 1/8th of a cup, and the rest water..This works brilliantly! I have a cat with vomiting issues. And she recently got a bad tooth, so isn’t eating enough and I have to give her soft food while I’m waiting to get her mouth fixed. Meanwhile the other cats keep eating all the grain free soft food I have for her (since she also pukes WAY more w wheat food), and if I don’t specifically hang w her in the bathroom regularly so she can eat in peace, she’ll go too long with no food and puke this dark brown bile stuff all over.... soo hard to get out of the carpet until this miracle bottle showed up!! Just a little mixed w hot water and the spot bot does the rest. I tried a few other things prior to getting this on 2 Of the areas I couldn’t completely eradicate no matter what.. and even on the most stubborn spots, this got it out 100%. Thank you bissel!! Only issue now is despite using the surface stain setting, I have several much cleaner round spots on my carpet in walkway areas.. demonstrating how soo over due we are for a full carpet cleaning lol

Meet Frank the terror! He loves to lounge on my upholstery.  Consequently, I needed to find an affordable way to clean everything.The next move was to go to Amazon.com for all the answers.I purchased Amazon’s Choice Hoover upholstery steam cleaner and this cleaner.I went to town cleaning my off - white sofa and side chairs.The cleaning fluid smells great and it destroyed the stains in a heartbeat.If you have wild kids or animals do not hesitate to invest in this cleaning method.No more calling expensive cleaning companies!  You can purchase these items for less than one cleaning company visit.The best part of it…you will have your cleaning kit for years!

Not sure about instantly removing stains but it is good when you pretreat with it a little stronger 1st then shampoo with the solution as directed.  It smells clean.  Not a strong scent.  I don't like perfumy cleaners so this was much better. This size bottle should last a while for my portable shampooer.  Also I got some solution on my hands and couldn't rinse right away....I didn't have any irriation.  I feel like this product is safe for people and pets.

Got this from Amazon because they didn't have it at our local Walmart, where we bought the machine. It works fine; nothing special but nothing to complain about. I didn't have to spend much time on the stains before they lifted out. If I remember correctly it seemed to come out after the first soak and removal. Will buy again for sure.
"
c.mac,5.0,2021 14 March,"
FYI when they ship these, there is a “Gripper” sticker around the cap so it prevents leaks when you get this product delivered. I use this with my portable Bissell Pet Stain Eraser machine and it cleans all stains, even on THICK and shaggy carpet. It works on cleaning up dog vomit or urine. It even works if stains have been there for a couple of days. The scent of the cleaner is refreshing and gets rid of any nasty smell that was previously there. This Oxy stuff is potent and it’s not only for pet stains, but the bottle says you can also use it on wine, coffee, and soda.  Haven’t tried it yet on those, but it definitely works for pet stains!!

"
Megan,4.0,2021 30 March,"
I love this thing! I have a long haired cat who gets a lot of hairballs and coughs them up on my carpet. I don’t have enough carpet to justify buying an upright Bissell so I bought this instead. It’s easy to clean and put back together. The battery lasts for a lot of uses. Only downfall is that the part where you put in the cleaner leaks and has since the first use. For that reason I’m giving 4 stars. My solution has been to put the cleaning solution into a spray bottle and spray the area I’m cleaning, then use the Bissell to suck it up. Works fine for me!

I thought I was going to need to replace my carpet.  I used every carpet cleaner I could get my hands on.  I even tried vinegar and baking soda, hydrogen peroxide as recommended by the pros.  Nothing worked and I was about to give up. Then I used Bissell Spot and Stain and the spot immediately went away.  The only con about this product is that I rinse it which takes a little longer because I feel that if I don't there's a residue left behind.

After watching YT videos about formulas for cleaning upholstery, I decided to try this instead. I used it in an old SpotBot with VERY hot water. It took an old grease stain out of my seat with a single pass, and made my light colored fabric look fresh and clean.
"
Asia,5.0,2020 21 May,"
I used this shampoo in my Bissell upwright shampooer and it worked like magic. I used this shampoo on the first half of my room with really bad stains from really old cat and dog pee, and beer stains from previous renters and then I used the different shampoo that came with my Bissell once I ran out of this and that shampoo did not work the same as this at all. So I'm gunna buy like 6 more of these because I like it so much. I also wasn't even intentionally looking for a smell and after shampooing a few rows of my carpet I thought, ""this smells really nice I can appreciate it"". Definitely recommend this but if you have a big space to shampoo(like mine in the pics) I'd get a few of these bottles to cover it all because it goes quick.
"
mandy,5.0,2021 1 December,"
We bought this to clean some really dirty carpets. When we ran out we bought a different brand. That brand just spread dirt, made the carpets look worse, and left a weird feel to the carpets. Bought this Bissell again and was able to clean up the mess the other left behind.

In the past, I was never happy with cleaners in a spray can, as they did not always get the staining out completely.  The Bissel l is excellent for this.  It goes deep into carpeting and pulls up any residual staining.  It is small so can be easily stored and charged.  I am glad I found this product.

Has a fresh scent. I don’t like strong smells, so this was perfect to use.
"
Mark Ibarra,4.0,2021 5 September,"
Can get rude of tough stains but if it's heavy duty stains it fades them out.
"
Bob Weigel,5.0,2021 1 July,"
I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this product due to the negative reviews mentioning leaking, poor suction, etc. I find this unit to be extremely efficient with good suction and have had no issues with leakage when used as directed.  This replaces for me a $250..00 upright cleaner by another manufacturer which was cumbersome, DID leak and was impossible to clean  A lot of good engineering went into this product.

I purchased this product to help with my elderly cat who gets sick more frequently. He just got sick on our microfiber couch and I was so happy that I had just ordered and received a bottle of this product. The couch stain came out beautifully and seems to have taken the odor out. My only comment is that the scent was very light or almost non existent when mixed with water so it didn’t smell much like cleaner. This product did also got out an old stain in our carpet that I have tried 3 other cleaning products on.
"
Lukejohns23,4.0,2021 29 April,"
seems to get rid of some spots from dirt and other stains.  Smell is not bad.  Does not last very long.  Does not cover much surface area.  Has done well to get rid of most spots around the house.  I recommend this product.
"
Rae,4.0,2021 24 May,"
Has a very nice scent, but it doesnt linger on fabric after use. Did my car floors and seats and was excited about the scent. Sadly, the aroma fades away. But it cleans and that's all that matters.
"
M. Semones,4.0,2020 21 April,"
This product is good for my little green machine but it doesn't go very far in usage.  Couldn't find a concentrated one so  bought three of these.  Ended up I've got to order more because this doesn't go very far.  Took two bottles to clean the front seat of my medium size car which wasn't very soiled.  It did the job very well, but think it's too expensive to have to use it right out of the bottle.  Should have a concentrated  upholstery cleaning product for the Little Green Machine.
"
Kelly Milgate,5.0,2022 6 January,"

JohnB,5.0,2020 25 September,"
But, does one have a choice? This is made specifically for the unit.I gave it a very hard task. We had a buildup of muck from foot wounds in the carpet. I had to pretreat twice, not because this didn't work but because the muck was that bad. Combining the use of this product with the use of the brush, the muck was completely removed and the pile of the carpet was restored as much as possible in a high traffic area. Restored to where it was before the muck occurred.

"
JenD,5.0,2021 24 February,"
So they want me to mention the scent, easy to use, and thickness. OK if this product has any thickness to it, toss it. It’s supposed to be a spray, to clean up dog or cat urine.  This spray works great in the machine by Bissell that it is made for.  It is a refill.Sometimes some of the things they want us to mention don’t fit the description whatsoever to the product.

Danielle Jimene,5.0,2020 31 August,"
I use this in a bissell pet cleaner. My dogs new large bone disappeared yesterday. We found it in a puddle of puke on our shaggy carpet. Pup is fine. The carpet though, I figured buying a new rug would be easier. But I already invested in all this cleaning stuff so why not try. The puke was lumpy, deep orange, sticky, and covered a good 12x12 inch patch of the carpet. Well this solution cleaned the carpet area so well it’s clear I have to clean the whole rug now.

It's a bit of a miracle worker. I use it with a bisell for removing stains on couches and they always look as good as new. One time someone put the bbq grill on top of the couch and obviously it got grease on it. After cleaning it no one can tell where the stain was.

"
Jessica Davis,5.0,2020 15 April,"
I used this as soon as it was delivered. My daughter threw up right on the livingroom carpet. We have light colored carpet and not to give you a bad image but her vomit was sooooo orange colored. I already have a Boswell spot cleaner for this purpose and it for it out of the carpet with just 2 rounds of spray, sit and scrub. I highly recommend!!  It also has a light decent scent. The last one I purchased smelled like chemicals but this specific one doesn’t. It has a light clean smell.
"
Dan,5.0,2020 24 August,"
I use this all of the time in my little portable Bissell to clean up cat pee and vomit on carpet. It leaves a fresh scent and does a great job. You may have to go over a particularly soiled area twice but that's normal.  Also, I don't use a separate oxy solution so I fill up my tank up to the marked water or oxy line, then fill up the rest with this solution. Does the trick every time.
"
Miranda,4.0,2020 8 October,"
I love this product!Very easy to use, all you have to do is remove the little film and pour into your machine. It last me a good bit, too! It smells good, but if I’m being honest, not as much as the Bissel pet cleaner did though. Overall, great product for getting stains out of old chairs/furniture, etc.
"
Adam wade,5.0,2021 7 January,"
This solution does exactly what you need it to do. The smell is clean and inviting not like some of these hard spot removers sold these days, this solution cleaned my couches with ease and believe me they look brand new after 5 years and three dogs! You only use 2oz per container which mean you dont use alot but get alot for your buck!
"
Sandy,4.0,2021 15 April,"
I have found that this particular item works better than the one for pets. It’s a thin liquid that you can leave on carpet before cleaning or afterwards for stubborn stains.

Bought this and the shampooer for cleaning up small messes from my kid and puppy. Cleans up puppy urine really well. Almost too well. Left really clean spots where I used it so I had to shampoo the entire room with my larger shampooer to even it out. Definitely will keep buying.
"
gennifer baker,5.0,2021 7 July,"
This works so well on carpets, rugs and upholstery! It removes the dirt/soiling and leaves it smelling clean and fresh. A must when using the Bissell Little Green machine (also a phenomenal product!). If you have kids or pets or both you need this.
"

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 The product containers would not stand up - the bottom was rounded on both bottles.  Was not happy with that for the fact that laying down the bottles may leak.
"
A. White,5.0,2021 3 August,"
We just wanted to give it a shot and it really has blown our mind. It works so great! Stains that were on our couch for years just came out! Just make sure to use warm water
"
James,3.0,2021 22 November,"
Good but not worth the money. Considering how much you need to clean a carpet it’s nuts. Just get an off brand that works just as well and half the price
"
A. VANDREUMEL,5.0,2019 12 July,"
You know those gross orange stains you get on your carpet when your cat throws up? This gets that out. I have a Bissell spot bot that gets a lot of use unfortunately, and I have always used this with it.  I don’t use the full amount it says to use and it still works fine. I find it a little pricey although Amazon has the best price generally.  I wish it had a fresher scent,  but whatever that smell is, it dissipates quickly.  Overall not a bad product and I will definitely keep re-purchasing as long as I have cats that have hairballs, which will probably be forever.
"
Patrick,5.0,2021 17 January,"
Bought this solution for my Bissell portable cleaner and it works wonders. I mainly use it to detail my car but I have used it on my sofa with no issues. I recommend agitating heavily soiled areas after solution is applied. I try to keep at least two bottles of this in the house at all times.
"
H Penz,4.0,2019 9 September,"
I borrowed a Bissell vac from a friend and needed to replace the solution that I used. It works with the Bissell line of vacuums but it is definitely greasy/oily feeling kind of like if you use way too much fabric softener. I learned you can use hot water, a bit of dish soap, vinegar and a little bit of baking soda to make your own solution. Needless to say, I had to replace the bottle I used up so here we are.

Spent $7ish dollars on this for my little green project. I used it to clean my entire couch and filled my tank twice. There are still plenty of uses left in it. It also got out the blue slime that was stuck on the sheet. I just sprayed it and let it soak then cleaned that area last.

"
Maria,1.0,2022 29 March,"
The actual product is ok, but I don't recommend ordering it from Amazon. The sticker sealing the bottle is not the best so it splilled inside the amazon bag and I lost a lot of product.Then when I took it out, it got on my hand. I didn't rinse it immediately bc the label didn't say anything about it being dangerous to skin. About 5 mins later my hand started  getting hot and itching. I saw white spots on it and assumed the product had dried on my skin...not the case. When i went to wash my hands I took a closer look and realized it was my skin. It was rising up like blisters. I kept rinseing and scrubbing my hand for a long time until it felt ok. A day or two later I scrapped that skin off with a pumus stone and my skin is growing back ok. I immediately returned the product and got a refund from Amazon.Its an ok product, just don't order it here

I tried the sample cleaning solution that came with my portable Bissell clean - which yielded an average result. Then I changed to the Bissell Professional Spot and Stain + Oxy Portable Machine Formula and got a STELLAR CLEANING RESULT and fresh, clean scent. In both cases, I pre-treated stained areas for 5 minute as per instructions. I will definitely purchase Bissell Professional Spot and Stain + Oxy Portable Machine Formula again.

Yes! It works well even without the expensive Bissell machine. All you need is a spray bottle and light Dilute it with warm water. And spray do a little scrub and you’re good to go. It really does work without the machine. Give it a try you guys.
"
Shawn Overman,3.0,2021 25 October,"

"
Chris & Nicole,5.0,2018 12 March,"
This cleaner came with a handheld spot carpet cleaner that I have.  I had to re-order another bottle because I used it so much, and it worked so well.  The treated areas do not end up hard or looking any different.  I have been using it to clean spots of cat pee and it has been very effective in removing the stain and the smell, which is no easy task.  I will continue to use this with my bissell spot cleaner and I would highly recommend this to anyone.  I have used it on white carpet and brown carpet, and it worked great on both without discoloring or damaging.
"
Roy A. Jones,4.0,2020 18 October,"
I bought this by accident but used it anyway in my full size Bissell Pro . It did exactly what I wanted, cleaning the carpet and removing all the stains.
"
Ana,5.0,2017 20 September,"
I have a spot cleaning machine also by Bissell. The sample liquid that came with it is much better than this even though this one claims to have Oxy boost to help you lift off stains. It definitely lifted the stains I had on my carpet. The dirtier area is still noticeably dirty. They ask you to check a section of the carpet in case this cleaner changes the color, I skipped that step so I'm not sure if the extra whiteness is color change or actually how well the carpet was cleaned, in combination with an Oxyclean product my partner used prior to me using this with the cleaner. No strong smell which I appreciate. I'm happy!
"
🧑🏾‍🚀 KNASA,3.0,2021 2 June,"
It works, but it doesnt really leave a good smell. It doesnt leave a bad one.. just doesnt leave a good one, when my couch dries is kind of smells like air dried clothes. But it got the job done i just spray fabreeze after it dries to add a smell. Also it’s expensive for its size. I use the whole bottle to clean the couches and rug once

I bought this product to clean the carpet in my basement. And boy did it do a great job?  I couldn’t believe how quickly it cleaned out all the dirt and spots. My carpet has a new lease on life now.
"
gr8hnd,5.0,2017 28 November,"
This stuff works. That’s what I like the most. What I like the least is, it gets used up really fast. It would be  so expensive to use often. But it works and it does what it says it will do.  It is not appropriate to place a number of other cleaning agents in the spot cleaners and so one has to be careful with what is put in there. That puts a bit of a difficult situation on the consumer, since we can’t go out and buy anything cheaper then the Bissell products. Still, I love the machine and this solution is perfect.
"
JesSca,5.0,2020 29 May,"
I've used this to get puke, red wine and dog accidents out of the rug.  I am gratefully left with absolutely no remnants or stains! I've used it with Bissells pet spot eraser.  However, I wish they would sell one more concentrated you can mix with water as the bottle seems to go quickly.
"
Chloe Jane,5.0,2019 11 April,"
My elderly cat will barf up some nasty colored stuff and this formula has done an amazing job of making it disappear. My carpet is light colored and she seems to barf up a dark brown color goo. I spray this on using the Bissell hand cleaner. I let it sit for a short time and then use the cleaner. Not only does it clean up the colored stuff (need to first pick up any ""chunks"") but it also eliminates any smell.  There is no stain residue. Good stuff.
"
Julie Bishop,5.0,2018 18 August,"
I bought this for my Bissell mini cleaner for the dining room chairs.  I ended up just dumping this stuff into a bucket with hot water and literally flooding the chairs as they were ""that"" dirty after being stored in a supposedly air conditioned unit (a MUST for here in FL).  Got the mold and mildew off, and some old very small stains that have just always been there.  I have used a LOT of steam cleaner products, this one ranks right at the top.  Nice fresh smell, not overpowering, but it literally gets all the stains out.
"
James P.,5.0,2021 19 March,"
Easy to use and mix. Fresh scent. Works well with the smaller machine. Not all the soap is made for the smaller unit so make sure your getting the right cleaner.

Petrarch,5.0,2019 2 October,"
I do like this cleaner. I bought it to use with the SpotBot I purchased and I love the way it cleans deep down stains. If I had a critique it would be that it is pricey for the amount of cleaner you get. That doesn't make me all that happy and would probably look elsewhere for a better price or use another product I like just as well.
"
Angela Bowens,5.0,2020 28 March,"
I have a new puppy and this has been a lifesaver! I’ve been using this cleaner in my bissell pet stain eraser, super powerful and easy to grab for a quick clean up that you need when you have a 9 week old puppy. Gets stains and smells out the first time.  Definitely worth the money.
"
Leigh A. Delany,3.0,2019 24 January,"
This is the perfect size for the hand held Bissell pet stain remover. Simply empty contents into compartment and you are ready to go. Unfortunately, that is all there is for your $11. A good bottle to use as a guide for how much cleaner to use. There is enough for 4 refills in this bottle. It is not concentrated. You use it as is. Considering how small an area you can clean with one fill, it is simply not worth the money. Sorry Bissell.  I did one cat accident with the Bissell cleaner, and another one (identical stains) with the Awesome pre-soak laundry liquid I got at Dollar Tree.  When they dried, I honestly could not see any difference. The cleaning machine, however, is very handy, especially when you can leave the cleaning liquid in it when not in use.

I've shampooed twice now and the smell is almost all gone. I used this on my mom's car that had a truly ground-in stain. It came out immediately. I love this.

I bought it for my hand held rug scrubber.  No mixing - use it straight from the bottle.
"
Barb from CT,5.0,2021 1 February,"
You go through a bottle quickly because of the amount you have to use to mix with water.
"
Amazonite,5.0,2021 30 March,"
This item is packaged too small. Bissell needs to offer 2 liter bottle sizes.

Decent smelling scent
"
spaghetti321,3.0,2021 19 January,"
Seems average, I have used this and I have also just used water when I’m out or in a pinch and I don’t notice a difference. Also a weird claim that it “permanently” removes stains. Do they usually come back? Lol
"
Wdryden,5.0,2020 20 August,"
This worked better than I had hoped. It cleaned various stains including chocolate,  ketchup, and  pasta sauce. One of the best cleaning products I've used.
"

Erika Becker,5.0,2018 18 July,"
I don't have much to use my cleaner on except when my puppers gets sickly. I use a Bissell handheld, and this cleaner and it makes my carpet like new.I've also used this on the furniture - I was a little worried that it would leave it sticky (suede couch) but it came out great and left my couch looking fresh and clean.Good scent and cleans stains pretty well.
"
Christa,2.0,2022 22 January,"
This was not that tough on the stain I was trying to get rid of. It may be better on stains that are not a few months old.

R. Duval,3.0,2018 10 June,"
I use this product in the handheld Bissell pet carpet as instructed in the users manual.  I use a liberal amount and make sure I scrub it into my carpets and ensure the product and urine are completely extracted from the carpet.  Unfortunately the carpet and room still reek of urine after the use of this product.  Truth be told the only product I have ever purchased and use to this day that truly removes urine smell is Nature's Miracle Urine Destroyer.  I am not an employee or have any financial interests in the company, I am just communicating about the product I find the most effective.
"
Kathleen H,5.0,2020 12 July,"
Used this cleaner on new stains as well as a few that were quite old. All of them came out beautifully. Would definitely recommend!
"
Sarah C,3.0,2020 4 April,"
This product will clean your carpet/couch that has no stains on it. I have not tried it on stains so I can’t tell you if it works on them or not. Not a huge fan of the scent but it doesn’t last. Product is not thick at all so not sure of the concentration. Expensive for what it is.
"

I use this in my Bissell Pet Stain Eraser portable carpet cleaner. It literally lifts stains right up and don’t even need to let it sit. It is a great and effective formula.

This works so well for pet stains or any other stain that you have! Even if it’s an old stain you think probably won’t be able to come out anymore this cleaner helps so much!
"
gr8day,5.0,2019 7 February,"
This produce was amazingly effective on my dog vomit & urine stains.  I cleaned the spots immediately so I don't know how it works on old stains, dry spots or stains that have ""set in"".  I use at full strength and it seems to work with any small spot cleaning device/machine.
"
Dustin Alexander,5.0,2020 18 November,"

"
Gemma,1.0,2022 26 June,"
Before and after pics.Doesn't remove stains and smell completely.I tried to clean these chairs with only the Bissell Professional Spot and Stain and it didn't do much. So I made a mix of dawn soap and softener. Works amazing. Way better for cleaning and cheaper because it goes by quick.
"
Featherznfur,5.0,2020 28 September,"
Of all spot removers and shampoo for carpet it is by far the best

Takes up stains.  Cleaned spot stains on carpets.  My car upholstery was heavily stained.  Cleaned it but couldn't make interior like new.  Perhaps with a few more rounds.

The spot remover works pretty well, but for the money, it does not go very far.  It would be better to have a concentrate at a lower cost.

What I was thinking when I bought off white bar stools, I have no idea...There was mystery marker? make up? some red stain on the chair for about 2 weeks until I got around to addressing it and realized I was out of upholstery cleaner. Purchased this and am super pleased, used with my bissel spot bot.
"
Adrian P. Gee,4.0,2018 29 May,"
Works well with the Bissell spot remover - which is also great for  cleaning. The trouble is that the machine drinks the stuff. I am going through bottles of this cleaner and may have to find something cheaper that works as well.
"
Rock_Lee,5.0,2018 4 December,"
Love the cleaning power of this product it does really good job cleaning deep into the cars carpets and seats to get the small to mild to even deep stains out. And I love the  smell of the product after i clean leaves very enjoyable  fresh smell.
"
Freda L. Kelly,5.0,2019 3 July,"

Barb,5.0,2018 30 July,"
This solution is amazing. I spilled beet soup on beige carpeting. I didn’t have any carpet cleaning solution and my spot lifter machine wasn’t working. I had to order a new machine and this solution from Amazon so the spot sat for three days. To my surprise, all the red stain came out!

Carolyn F,5.0,2019 26 March,"
Used this product in the Bissell Deluxe Spot Cleaner - this cleans well without leaving a funky residue or smell if used according to the instructions. My only complaint is with the device which uses a lot of the product at once.
"
Maria V. Mejia,4.0,2020 30 January,"
Excellent and effective product.
"
Eric,3.0,2020 15 August,"
Did not do great on coke stains and blood stain that were in our carpet. It is not concentrated so just pour the solution directly into your spot cleaner.
"
Emily Wurtz,4.0,2018 18 January,"
Works really well. I gave it 4 stars because if you do a whole staircase or large room you'll go through a whole bottle. It got out asphalt from my carpet that was tracked in.
"
Jes A,5.0,2018 14 June,"
I drive a car with fabric upholstery for Lyft. I used this in my Proheat cleaner and it removed a spot of adhesive that a professional upholstery shop couldn't get out. Overall, my seats and carpet looked almost new again after the first use.Customers complimented the smell for days.

"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 6 January,"
Removes tough stains.
"
B.m,5.0,2019 7 January,"
Definitely the best spot remover that I have found yet. I use it in a spray bottle and a little brush scrubs just about any stain out. I've not had any stains come back or show through again.

"
j8819,5.0,2019 9 June,"
This worked well with my portable cleaner. Following the directions for deep stain will require much of the product; I recommend ordering more than one bottle. I used it on discolored upholstery and it removed the discoloration.
"
R. R. Blair,5.0,2018 12 August,"
I purchased the latest small hand-held Bissell spot cleaner to use in place of a full size upright Bissell cleaner. The Bissell Professional Spot and Stain + Oxy cleaner, used in my portable Bissell machine removes spots quickly and with far less effort than the older larger machine ever did.

I used it for a carpet shampooer. To my surprise it really made almost no difference on my carpet. I received a small bottle of a different Bissell product that worked wonders so I thought another Bissell product would also.

Tom Steele,5.0,2018 16 January,"
I've used most of the Bissel cleaners at some point or another. This has been one of my favorites so far. I like the pet stain and odor remover too. But I really like the Oxy clean in this and it seems to get really stubbob stains out. We have both a Bissel and another brand of cleaner and this works well in both and there are easy directions to figure out the right amount to mix together no matter what brand you use.I have no idea if you really need to use Bissel solution or if other brands would work fine, but we get the Bissel because it always works well, so why try something else? This just works and the spot and stain formula seems to be concentrated to really get tough stains out.Here's my END-ALL TEST.  We have a small pomeranian with a weak stomach. He has to have Science Diet dog food or he throws up this neon yellow bile liquid that stains like crazy. And he's always getting into something bad somehow or another and we have episodes every month or so.If this can get that stain out, then we know it is good. I tested it by finding one of those spots and cleaning it then asking my wife to come in and see if she could find where the stain had been. I had marked the location in my mind using a couple of landmarks in the room. She couldn't find where it had been and it was hard for me, even though I knew where it was. This stuff is good!
"
Kayce McCarty,4.0,2018 9 January,"
We are always looking for a product to help clean our carpets. We have three older dogs who have accidents, so we frequently need to do some spot cleaning with our small carpet cleaner.Bissell is a brand we trust and have used for many years. This cleaner works well - better than others we have tried. It also helps keep areas cleaner longer. Seems to repel dirt sticking to areas where stains were.The scent is pleasant - not overwhelming like other products we have used.If you have pets and carpets, I highly recommend this product.
"
Squeal,4.0,2018 8 June,"
We use this in our Pet Stain Eraser and it works well to get out our pet and kid stains.  I just wish we didn’t have to use so much of the bottle each time. (Sometimes I cheat and don’t put in as much solution as is called for because I can’t stand using up the bottle so fast. Shhh.)  I always keep at least one bottle on hand for the next pet accident or markers/paint on carpet snafu.
"
Ini P,5.0,2018 12 August,"
This is a great stain remover. I used it with my Bissell Spotclean ProHeat Pet machine. This was my first time using this spot and stain solution and it worked like a charm. My 3 year old opened a pack of paint (from the dollar store) when I wasn't looking and of course spilled it all over herself and the carpet. I wanted to cry but I was still hopeful it would come out with this solution. Good thing I had it already. Some spots were a little harder to clean up but I sprayed some of it on the stain and let it sit for a minute or two and it came up. As you can see in the pictures, it's like it never happened. I will say that I added some bissell oxy boost formula that came with my spot cleaner. I don't know how well this works on older set in stains. But it works like a charm with fresh ones.
"
Cody Robertson,4.0,2018 10 June,"
If youre using this solution, do yourself a favor and wear gloves. Its says OXY on it for a reason. Hydrogen peroxide is the oxidizing agent and the concentration is alot more than what youre used to. Its been 2 days and my hands still feel the effects. Great product, works well, but just do yourself a favor and wear gloves
"
D.Berdanis,5.0,2018 2 January,"
I love Bissell cleaning products to use in my Bissell carpet cleaner.  I can't recall ever having anything but good to say about their products.I just cleaned the carpet in my whole house, after the holidays were over.  What I love is how well the pet stains come out.As easy to use as any other carpet cleaning product I've used.  Just add the amount needed into the soap dispenser and clean carpet as usual.Because I'm always right on anything that dirties my carpet, I don't have any real tough stains.  I did have 2 spots that didn't dry quickly and the damp area got dirty again and left a dirtier spot.  Going over those areas a couple of times with the machine and the spots were gone.I also noticed that there wasn't any strong soap odor when I used this.Never had any problem with Bissell carpet cleaning products and will always specifically buy them whenever I clean my carpets.
"
Joanna D.,5.0,2017 24 December,"
This cleaner is FAR MORE EFFECTIVE than others I've used. The oxy bleach takes out stains well. If you've used the brand you get in the grocery store (red jug), I can tell you, the Bissell is way better. Sadly, the local stores never carry it, so if you have a potential carpet emergency, you may want to keep this on hand.I've tried several brands of pet-cleanup products and Bissell comes out on top every single time.
"
Melanie S.,5.0,2020 21 June,"
I've had a Bissell spot bot for a while. I mostly used it when we had a dog but kept it around for furniture and car upholstery. But I generally just used a mix of whatever laundry of fabric cleaner we had with water or OxiClean. But after getting a couple of stains on the couch I finally bought this and I was very impressed by the results. It got both of the spots I cleaned with zero issues and one had been there for months. So for that reason alone, it's been 100% worth it. I do wish it was concentrated and you got more out of a bottle but unless you're a pet owner hopefully you're not using it frequently.

 that uses spot cleaning fluid to soak and vacuum up messes. This type of cleaning machine does a bit of scrubbing on its own, but is mostly an application and removal vehicle for the fluid that does the work.The Professional Spot and Stain + Oxi fluid does that work very well. With the ""professional"" label, I was expecting a strong industrial aroma when I opened the bottle, but in fact it has a mild scent that reminds me a little of the green-apple scent that accompanies the dedicated ""pet stain eraser"" chemical.As for how it works: very well. It put down a proper misty stream, and after five minutes brought up the urine components that cause stained carpets. I did not need to use very much for the test stain, which means the machine still has a load ready for the next cleaning job.

We have a Bissell pet carpet cleaner. We currently have one young dog who is still being potty trained and one cat who is older and vomits occasionally. We use our carpet cleaner quite often. You do not have to dilute this spot cleaner. You can just pour it into the carpet cleaner and you are good to go.We used it on an older mystery stain, an area the dog peed in the day before (that had been cleaned as well as possible with hand towels and spray) and a new cat puke stain (after removing what could be removed). It removed all of the stains. Some of the stains (particularly older ones) require the machine to be left on it a few minutes or moved back and forth several times. The areas smelled clean and fresh afterwards. It seemed to remove all of the unwanted scents. I would definitely recommend this solution.

Terry R. Nye,5.0,2017 28 December,"
A small bottle of this Bissell Professional Spot and Stain + Oxy cleaning solution was provided with a Bissell Pet Stain eraser wet vacuum I ordered.  I was thrilled to see it available in this 32 ounce size.  We have 5 cats one of whom vomits frequently, so having a good rug and carpet cleaning solution is crucial.  What really sets this product apart from others we have used is it not only cleans up recent stains and pet messes well but even removed some old carpet stains that had been present for a very long time.  Minimal scrubbing is needed, and this solution makes the portable Bissell wet vacuums work great.This is a great cleaning solution for portable wet vacuums, and is ideal for pet owners.  Definitely highly recommended.
"
Brad,4.0,2018 23 July,"
Works very well at removing new and old stains. Having said that a lot only goes a little ways. It is only for spot cleaning though so that should be expected. Good product.
"
NicbachDVM,5.0,2018 9 January,"
For some reason, this particular solution is only compatible with the Bissell handheld machines. I'm not sure what the difference is that would cause this not to be used in full sized machines, but be aware of this. They have the model numbers listed. I used this in the Little Green Machine.A stomach virus ravaged my household this weekend, and I had a 5 year old vomiting up blackberries all over our white carpet. After doing a prep scrub and seeing the berries rub into the fibers, I was convinced this would never come clean.I used the full strength (full cup) and went to town. Numerous passes and wouldn't you know - it came 90% out. That's way better than I ever imagined it would. I'll have to finish with my full sized machine, but it exceeded my expectations. And it smells nice. Recommended.

I love my Bissell machine, I’ve had a couple through the years but I don’t ever want to be without my Bissell. The Bissell Professional Spot and Stain + Oxy Portable Machine Formula in the  32 Oz is a great cleaner for an affordable price. At our local store, you will pay much more than here on Amazon for a good carpet cleaner formula. The spot and stain formula is a strong formula and cleans extremely well.
"
Janis,5.0,2019 2 November,"
I have the Bissell small portable cleaner for pet stains.  I just read some of the other reviews, I guess I didn't read the instructions and I have been diluting it just like I was diluting the solutions for the uprights when I used them in the portable.  This one still works better diluted than all the other Bissell carpet cleaners I have tried, and I've tried many.  For a stain that just won't come out, use Stain 1.  (I pried that recommendation from my professional carpet cleaner, he was torn up about letting it slip).
"
OutlawPoet,5.0,2018 31 January,"
This works very well.My grown dog sometimes gets puppy headed and I have mistakes to clean up.  It easily lifts the stains and the carpet looks clean and fresh!I should add that it also cleans up the hot chocolate stain your nine-year-old makes and doesn't tell you about and tries to clean but fails and hides it under a dog bed thinking you'll never see it.  (This was a...moment.)Easily adds to my carpet cleaner and works very quickly.  No irritating aroma.
"
BookWorm,5.0,2018 7 February,"
I have a 17 year old cat wit.h kidney disease, which means she often upchucks on the carpet, so I need a very heavy duty carpet cleaning shampoo. This Bissell Spot and Stain product works well to remove those horrible stains made by pet foods. Using the hottest water I can get out of my faucet, I clean up the stain by hand, then use my spot-cleaning machine with this shampoo to clean up the area. The results are perfect! Even stains that have been on the carpet overnight come clean using this product.Even if you don't wish to drag out your carpet cleaning machine, using this shampoo and a washcloth produces good results until you can get after it with your machine.Five stars for cleaning up kitty upchuck stains.
"
Loreta Hardy,5.0,2020 28 October,"
It takes care of any stain you got. Great smell.
"
Dawn Armstrong,5.0,2018 2 January,"
So i ordered this even tho my pups have not had a accident in a long time. Then a day after i got it...my dog had diarrhea all over our carpet!! To be fair she just had puppies and so her tummy is all messed up, but dang that was a mess!!After the inital cleaning, the next morning there was still a brown spot on the floor, so i got out my handy little green machine and used this and it cleaned it right up!!Not the best smelling cleaner ever but it worms and that is what counts.
"
Betty,5.0,2018 3 January,"
We do share our home with pets, and the family room Berber carpet gets a workout. This is an excellent stain lifting product to use with our Bissell machine. We were careful to use the recommended amount and added no boosters. The results were outstanding, with a fresher smelling atmosphere, too. Drying was as expected, and no shadows appeared. It is so concentrated that the value is okay, too.
"
KODY,5.0,2018 7 January,"
I own the Bissell portable Pet and Spot cleaners (yes I own a dog!) and this cleaner works great in both.  I have found using an Oxy based cleaner to clean up urine accidents works much better at getting rid of both the stain and the odor of the accident.  It is great using this with either of the machines inbetween doing an overall cleaning of the carpet which I do about twice a year.  Effective product!
"
Hope Gonzales Stouffer,5.0,2020 29 March,"

"
Pat Gillis,5.0,2019 13 November,"
The solution cleaned stains on my carpet and it did it without having to scrub hard.
"
Joseph91,5.0,2018 26 January,"
This is a great product. Bissell recommends this for their spot cleaning line, not their deep cleaners, so they may think that Oxy is too much cleaning power for a whole carpet, but I would be comfortable using it either in our Spot Shot or our Green Machine, as long as we limit the use to the stained area. Either way, it's death on stains! Recommended.
"
TobycW,5.0,2018 9 January,"
Although you can use any carpet cleaner in the SpotClean Pro, I opted to try this Bissell branded product.  It works well and doesn't affect any of the carpet I have tried it on.  I use our SpotClean mainly on pet stains.  Gets stains out without much fuss.

Juanita Floyd,4.0,2018 4 January,"
I tried this this morning on an old cat barf stain and a couple of fresh places from last night. Impressive results. The product removed the residual stain in the old spot and completely cleaned the new places.  Very good results. Will be using this from the start from now on. Love my little green machine!
"
Angelfish,5.0,2018 14 January,"
This Bissell Professional Spot and Stain + Oxy does a great job  My15 yr old  Grandson tends not to be as careful or picky as I am  and  does not clean up spills as thoroughly as I do .Easy to use, reasonable price and I have always  trusted  Bissell products.
"
ER,5.0,2018 20 February,"
We have two kiddos who know no limits when it comes to food in the living room, which equates to lots of spots on our carpet.  We have to clean our carpets pretty frequently and this stuff helps keep the stains from setting permanently.  Definitely recommend!
"
InNormal,5.0,2018 19 May,"
We love our Bissell carpet cleaner and this spot and stain + Oxy is such a great addition.  We had a stain on our white rug that I had tried everything on and this was able to remove it.  Really great stain remover.
"
Vintage PowerReader,5.0,2018 4 January,"
I have dogs and cats and live in mud country. This stuff works like a dream, the carpets get really nice and squeaky clean. I run my carpet cleaner at least twice a month, plus spot issues. I use it my hoover machine and it works fine.
"
Schwartz,5.0,2018 7 January,"
This cleaned up spots on my carpet from our dog's dirty feet without issue. However, to be fair any Bissell cleaning solution I have tried has seemed to work equally well but I didn't have any complaints with this one. Overall I'd say if you see it and need it and the price is right get some.

"
Tom Bricknell,1.0,2021 22 May,"
I bought this assuming that it was a concentrate, since it said to check instructions on your cleaner for how much to use.  Instructions on cleaner does not really say implying that you use it full strength but you really do not know for sure.  This is deceptive packaging to get people to buy VERY expensive per use liquid.  I am very disappointed in this companies very obvious intentional deception to trick you while you are in a store and can't evaluate its value without the machine instructions.  This is inexcusable I  will likely not buy any of this companies products again.
"
Matt,5.0,2018 3 January,"
This works great in the Bissell Spotclean machine.  A little goes a long way, so this bottle lasts a long time.  It has a fresh smell to it and gets out pretty much every stain you can imagine.  We did have to run it twice over a stubborn stain, but it still worked after that second time.  Overall, great!
"
Sean Ries,4.0,2021 30 August,"
It is exactly the original, meant for your machine.  Shipped quick which is great because we really needed to clean the carpet before company came!  Honestly my biggest problem with this item is the packaging.  I understand wanting to create a signature look, but having the bottle be wider at the base than it needs to be just means it takes up valuable space in the cupboard.  For those of us that have limited space, it is a pain to have items like this taking up the space.
"
Denny,5.0,2020 24 July,"
I cannot emphasize how amazing this product is. I shattered a full glass of red wine all over new WHITE carpet, and this was able to get it out instantly. On top of that, any of the messes our dog has made have come out so easily and so clean. I live by this product now and don't buy any other carpet cleaners. Even if not using for a dog, it's amazing. I recommend it to everyone I meet.Carpet cleaner that actually cleans, and it smells great too.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I bought this for my bissell spot stain vacuum,  I loved how the 8 oz it came with did the job so I decided to get the bigger one instead,it really does take out the stains and it was very very surprising how it actually worked, it makes the carpet smell good as well , it isn’t a super super strong scent but you can definitely smell it, so if you have any pets I recommend this aswell because animals can make some things stink lol.
"
Joseph L. Chernicoff,5.0,2019 5 March,"
It took a few minutes to figure out how the device worked, but I have a lot of satisfaction from using the  Bissell Professional Spot Remover with the supplied cleaning solvent...easy to use, easy to clean, and works better than expected on my carpeting...
"
chat,3.0,2020 8 September,"
I bought a Bissel machine with this formula. I was able to remove a light stained of my couch but I cant seem to do a spot stained. I did it over and over and once dry I tried it again but it is still there. I wonder if I should mix a little bleach in it to help.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 11 July,"
I like the smell and the ease of use. I have tile floors in my apartment so I use lots of area rugs, large and small. The small ones can go in the washer, but for the large ones, I use a carpet shampooer and vacuum. It's a Bissel, so this is the product I use to clean my large rugs.
"
Chris,5.0,2020 30 December,"
My dog gets into all kinds of stuff and it comes out both ends. Bissell Spot and Stain works great in my spot cleaner, as well if not better than any other pet specific cleaner and it’s very good on paint spills and mud. Scent is fresh and not overpowering.

Follow the directions exactly and you will be satisfied.  I highly recommend this and the Bissell portable carpet cleaner (handheld) for getting up new stains.  Keep it handy and full of the cleaning fluid so that you can get right on pet stains when they happen (or just get rid of your pet - ha!).

I bought these as a low cost option to the cheapo glasses at Walmart. I was not disappointed at all. They have a nice thin rim and they are great. They are something that you need to be gentle with. But for those saying they broke easily, if you look in the pictures, they show a broken glass replacement policy. I broke 2 and simply messaged the seller through Amazon like it says and within a day I have 2 new glasses on the way. I recommend snapping a picture of the broken glass to make things easier. But I found out after the fact and they worked with me and stood behind their promise!

The bowl is clear glass with an excellent shape for red wine the base is cheap plastic which detracts from the quality of the product
"
Sarah,5.0,2022 31 October,"
The packaging was perfect, beautiful, no bubbles in glass and the smell of the wine in the glass was wonderful

They are very pretty but also very fragile. My husband broke one just trying to hand wash it so be very careful.
"
Heather D.,5.0,2022 21 September,"
I love these glasses. After breaking my very last favorite wine glass I searched for months in store for new ones. Not being able to feel the glass when ordering online, I was hesitant. But I took the chance, and I am so glad I did! Perfect thin lip and long stem. Exactly what I was looking for!
"
Jaye,5.0,2022 7 October,"
These glasses are great for a gift or at home. The glasses are huge ! I recommend hand washing these glasses .
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 4 October,"
Glass is super thin and a pleasure to sip out of. Shape easily allows for swirling.
"
skm,5.0,2022 7 September,"
These are nice looking glasses. They are very lightweight which make me think they may be easy to break or possibly blow over if you are outside. Otherwise, they have worked well for us and we enjoy using them.

Awesome glasses for an excellent price. Other brands may charge 3 to 4 times more for the same product.

Isabela Rodrigues,5.0,2022 20 July,"
Great price for a great wine glass! It’s wide on the sides, it looks expensive! I received a lot of compliments from my friends and received a-lot of questions on where I got it from. Unfortunately 2 of my glasses had broken previously after a month of use but the owners customer service levels are exceptional! They did not hesitate to apologize for the inconvenience and provide me another pair of glasses which I was very grateful for because I truly loved the glass and it’s unique shape!! Thank you so happy to have my pair of 4 again!!

Craig W.,5.0,2022 14 May,"
These glasses add just the right amount of luxury to a good meal.  They are not the thinnest you'll find but they are nothing like a thick glass.  That being said, they still feel delicate and will feel like being cared for.  the rim feels nice for my almost weekly meal of crab legs with a chardonnay.  I like that they feel somewhat right for either white or red.  I enjoy a nice Paso Robles Cab with a ribeye from time to time and it feels nice for that as well.  I am still on a hunt for a thinner red.  I have a thinner white that I got from a Rombauer gift set.  But these are just the right price for enough to go around the table and also for weekly use.  I like them.  just had crab legs tonight...here is a pic of my chardonnay...sorry for the dirty smudges.

I bought these for my sister for Christmas. She loves them and uses one every evening. I waited to review due to wanting to see that they were durable and they are! And have stayed beautiful. I’m planning on ordering some for myself too!
"
Chevy,3.0,2022 25 August,"
I loved the shape of these glasses and the thinness. Disappointed, after only 5-6 uses one of them broke. Always washed them by hand. They were in the dishpan soaking and I reached in to wash one and it was broken. Don’t even know how it broke. Wouldn’t buy again, too fragile.
"
Dev Joshi,5.0,2022 10 August,"
Lightweight and wonderful design. It is easy to hold and the packaging is good enough to make it a perfect.
"
Helen Corbitt,2.0,2022 2 September,"
Update:After I posted the review below, the seller contacted me asking what they could do to make the situation better.  They offered to replace the products.  I accepted.  (I had forgotten about the warranty as I'm not used to glassware having warranties). I received the glasses 2 days later.  (The Amazon rep says that often sellers will reach out but then never send the promised replacements!)  This is a reputable seller and I will buy from them in the future if needed.  Again, this is customer service as it should be.Original post:This is a very pretty goblet.  Holds a lot which is what I wanted as was using it for summer lemonade spritzers.  However on the second hand washing/drying a large chunk of the glass fell out!Became gun shy for other such looking glasses.Mention:  when went to return I read that I would have to send back and then wait for refund.  Hmm.  So I called Amazon Customer Service.  I was credited for the glasses and didn't have to return unbroken glass.  That's what customer service is supposed to be.

Carol Coleman,5.0,2022 16 August,"
Really nice glasses. Good size but not bulky to hold.
"
Rodney Gooding,3.0,2022 22 February,"
This is not a carefree wine glass - if your drunk perhaps don't use these.. at all.Using this glass is a deliberate action, to be enjoyed but cautiously as even pouring into it with your bottle leads to cracks if you ding it 😱We bought 4 and argue about whose turn it is to clean it and put them away everytime we use it - we're down to 1 now so...  I can't recommend it as we're paranoid about them - every time we go to wash it it's a joy as the neck is too narrow so you can't put your hand into it so enjoy cleaning it... Somehow.however you do that is up to you but might I suggest NOT shoving a scrub cloth into it, using a spoon to reach into it to help clean it or the dishwasher.Handwash carefully as it will split with pressure!For your sanity buy 3x what you think you need and use carefully or just avoid it altogether - it's a beautiful wreck just waiting to happen.Durability is a joke, but a joy to behold 😓
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 22 July,"
When I first got these the first thing I thought was these thin glasses aren’t going to last not a week. But surprisingly these have outlasted all of my thick glasses. These are my favorite wine glasses!

These glasses are beautiful, love to drink red wine from them. I broke one accidentally when i took it out of the dishwasher and i contacted the seller and sure enough by the next day i had a set of two wine glasses delivered free of charge as a replacement. AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE! This seller sells a great product but also has great customer service. Would buy from them again!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 30 September,"
when my boyfriend and I learned we would be quarantining for the unforeseeable future we realized we were going to be drinking a lot of wine.  wanting a glass that would be versatile to many types of wine and also have a light crisp high end feel. I really wanted NICE glasses. I ordered these and was pleasantly surprised at how perfect they were.  I promptly washed them and poured us our first drink, we said cheers and gently tapped our glasses AND ONE SMASHED... hadn't even had contact with our lips yet and we were cleaning up spilled celebration. I promptly ordered another pair, because they really are that great, and we assumed it was our fault. BUT just to be sure I shot an email to the company asking if there was a way to replace one and ya know what they did.... sent us a new set. immediately, without question and expedited ....  they even checked back to make sure we were happy and noted that during these unprecedented times they want to take care of people... or something to that effect which made me cry.moral of the story- buy these glasses. for yourself, as a gift, as gift for yourself.  they are beautiful and feel lovely in your hand, and we haven't had another break since! I even put them in the dishwasher because I like to like dangerously and they come out perfect every time.

"
Turf Monkey,5.0,2022 19 June,"
I really like the shape and the breakage guarantee. The stem on one was much thinner than the other glass.  Not a problem but good to know that they have more of a handmade look to them.
"
Kimberly Carole,4.0,2022 21 March,"
I love the thin lip and the size but the stem snapped off while drying with a towel. So unfortunate.
"
Chanika Morton,5.0,2022 16 June,"
The glasses arrived on time. They were very well packed. Unfortunately, one of them broke the second week after I received them, while I was washing them. You have to be VERY mindful of how delicate they are.
"
SR 88,4.0,2021 24 December,"
Best wine glass I've owned thus far. Yes, they are thin and a bit fragile, but that's what I want. A lightweight, thin rimmed glass. You just have to treat them with extra care. The shape of these glasses really accentuates  the aromas of the wine. I primarily  got these for bold reds, but I've found that whites are just at home in these as well.
"
Lynn Weymann,5.0,2022 12 May,"
I really like these glasses. They look pretty, they have a nice balance, and they are lightweight while holding a good sized glass of wine. I haven't had them long so I can't gauge durability. I have just been lightly washing by hand after use. I got 2 but I will be adding a couple more.
"
julie,3.0,2022 3 August,"
Nice size & shapeHowever not very sturdy. Thin glass, would break easy
"
Corrina Kingbird,5.0,2022 17 May,"
We have had this product for a bit of time now and one of the glasses had gotten chipped. When we asked about the lifetime warranty we were met with the absolute best customer service and expedited shipping for a replacement.  10/10 will buy glasses from them again.
"
Raymond K.,5.0,2022 26 March,"
I found these glass and knew I must have them. I really like the product and how they look. When they arrived, one of the glass stems was broke even though the glasses were properly packaged, but something happened during delivery and the glass broke. I contacted the company and they dropped-shipped a replacement. I cannot say more about the customer service. They were on it right away. Well done! I’ve already shared my experience with friends because I believe in this company.
"
Brooke Pennington,5.0,2022 30 March,"
Gave these as a gift and they were very well received. Was lucky to be able to sample some wine from them afterward and they really do make a difference in taste. The shape is perfect for getting a sense of the wine's fragrance, and the delicate glass makes them seem a lot more expensive than they are. Will definitely be giving these as gifts again in the future for their popularity and low price point.
"
Lissan,5.0,2022 30 May,"
These are beautiful wine glasses. One glass cracked while I was hand drying and the seller immediately sent a replacement. They were very attentive and provided quick service. I will definitely order again from this company.
"
HB,5.0,2022 5 March,"
Update (3/11/22): After my review the seller contacted me and asked to replace the broken glass. They did NOT ask me to change my review or for anything in return. The order arrived today! Top notch customer service! Highly recommend these products with customer service clearly being their top priority!These are very pretty but one broke within a month. I was too slow to request a return. Oh well. If you can be very careful with them, they are really nice, but very fragile.
"
David Whaley,5.0,2022 18 May,"

Laura Sherwood,5.0,2022 18 June,"
Beautiful shape!!  Very classy, they hold a nice amount of wine.
"
Richard Chen,2.0,2022 31 July,"
I dropped in a few ice cubes (literally from the opening of the glass, so only a few inches) and upon landing into the glass, the ""glass"" cracked and a piece fell off. so now it is basically useless. The glass was kept in room temperature and the ice cube is your regular ice cube, not extra sharp or heavy or anything. This was also only my 3rd time using them, so it definitely wasn't from regular wear and tear either. So yea, unless you plan on being 100x extra careful with these glasses, these are not sturdy at all and you should probably just spend extra money on higher quality glass.
"
Kindle Customer,4.0,2021 14 May,"
We are avid wine drinkers and really like these.  They are very elegant, and not too expensive.  Somewhere in the middle regarding quality, but GREAT as a standard glass.  We tend to like bigger glasses and these have a beautiful shape and are a pleasure to drink from.  One thing to note, they are hand blown, so there can be variations.  We ordered 2, liked them a lot so bought 6 more.  2 of the 6 were noticeably thicker stems vs. the rest and when I wrote the company asking about this, they sent replacements without question.  Definitely would recommend for the casual wine drinker!
"
Diana,5.0,2022 8 March,"
I was surprised by the quality of the wine glasses.They are simply beautifully crafted. The feel of the stem in your hand is light weight to the touch. The diameter of the opening of the glass is perfect to allow the aroma of the wine  to breathe.So happy I went on an brought two more .
"
Abe,4.0,2019 31 December,"
I ordered two of these for twenty bucks. Wow, great deal. Nice quality. I'm six feet tall and have medium-sized hands so you can get an idea of the proportionate size of said glass. It's not that large. In fact, I was hoping for a bit bigger, but I'm okay with these. They are handblown so people who want machine-perfect glasses need to stay calm and smell the wine. Hand blown glass = charming. Yeah, there might be a little imperfection here or there (I haven't found any yet) but it is made by skilled artisans and not a bunch of morons in a huge factory with machines doing everything. These glasses have nice karma as a result. I'm going to enjoy drinking some good wine in them. I tend to buy bottles in the $20-$30 price range and I use Vivino to find tasty wines with high ratings, so I'm no slouch and these glasses will do just fine. I might order a few more.

"
kimtran,5.0,2019 25 May,"
I ordered both the Burgundy style and the all purpose style. I love how delicate and clear the glasses are. Definitely what I was looking for from a classy step up from Target kind of wine glass! I love looking at the color of my red wine when drinking from the Burgundy glass. The all purpose for my whites is perfect as well. Had a massive wine haul from a recent Napa trip and I knew I had to upgrade my glasses. These are it. However, shipping and packaging is a critical problem. Because of how delicately these are made, they are so easily breakable. And they certainly did break. Customer service is top notch in replacing the glasses, however it took three shipments to finally get all the glasses I ordered intact! I hate to waste all this packaging and glass because they are poorly packaged to begin with. That's my only reason for one star off.Update: Adding a star back. I use these glasses weekly and always wash carefully by hand. Have had these for two years. Still beautiful and holding up nicely. I'm seeing lots of angry reviews of people breaking their glasses during use. These are in fact very delicate glasses. You have to treat accordingly!
"
Lisa,5.0,2022 16 January,"
I have had 2 of them since November and use the same one every night.  I love the feel, tallnees of the stem & how it swirls the wine.  I usually hand wash it but have put it in the dish washer too.  Just handle with care.  They are delicate, but that is why they look so beautiful!  Great packaging too.
"
Tam Ralston,5.0,2021 28 July,"
I ordered these beautiful glasses and I absolutely love them. While I was washing one of my glasses, it broke. I knew that the company stood behind their product. I got out my box that they were sent in and looked for the email address to reach out to them. As soon as I emailed them, I had a response within the hour. From the time I reached out to this company to the time the new ones were on my door step was less than two days. I AM OVER THE MOON IMPRESSED WITH ATTENTION TO CUSTOMER SERVICE.Not only is it the best product, but the company stands behind their product. I would HIGHLY recommend this product for sure.

Scott's Mom,5.0,2021 7 February,"
I absolutely love these glasses!  They're so elegant.  Shipping was super fast and they're packed so safely I could probably have thrown the box across the room and done no damage.  The only reason I marked sturdiness and durability with 4's is because these are hand blown, super thin glasses (which is what I wanted).  A person will have to be careful with them because of that, making them not all that sturdy and durable, so if you want a wine glass that you can bang around, drop, or take with you on a picnic, I guess these are not them.  I, on the other hand, got exactly what I was looking for with this purchase.  Love Love Love them!  Highly recommend for the discerning wine drinker.
"
Wendy E. Gibson,5.0,2022 9 April,"

MTM,5.0,2022 28 February,"
Great glasses.  Very light to hold. They are fragile so have to be careful washing and storing etc. but very good. I wanted a thin rim and that is what these have.  Extremely good packaging and arrived quickly.
"
Deb,5.0,2021 2 February,"
I have had my set of glasses for over 2 months.  I use them constantly!  I have no idea why some are claiming they are 'so fragile'.  And for those stating they were broke as soon as they opened them....  I can almost guarantee it was due to the 'delivery person'.  I have personally witnessed many of them just tossing packages and have had a couple other items shattered because of that.  I have accidentally knocked mine off of the coffee table and nothing happened.  I was very reluctant to put them in the dishwasher because of the reviews.  But I finally decided to and they were 100% fine!!  They are classy and fun!!  LOVE THESE!!  And HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!!
"
Taja Simone,2.0,2022 2 August,"
I love the look of these glasses, but that are extremely fragile. This is my second time purchasing these and they have broken very easily. Something as simple as washing the rim with a wet paper towel, has caused them to crack and break. I thought maybe the first round was just a bad bath, but I was wrong. Very dissatisfied!
"

"
Lisa Malone,5.0,2021 10 December,"
I didn’t save a pic.  I thought they were amazing, but the first day we washed them and hung them in the wine cabinet, it fell out and broke at the base. It did not shatter. It broke right at the base feom the stem. So we are going with user error and will be ordering them again
"
Drew,5.0,2022 1 March,"
Has a great shape style. I find it elegant. Very fragile n ultra thin. It does come across like it’s Plastic, but it’s not. Holds a great amount of wine. It’s  a plus 😉.

"
Omar,5.0,2021 12 December,"
Great look and feel, fancy, like my wife likes to say. I used them this past Thanksgiving and after the day was done I they broke while I dried them.  Not because I dropped them or anything like that, they literally broke as I was drying them with the drying towel.

"
SuperLoop,5.0,2021 7 February,"
Great product and excellent customer service.  We’ve ordered two sets of these.  Of those, one glass did come with some imperfections (nothing major).  Emailed them and they made it right with a new set immediately. Very nice and very fast.  Also, as to the durability, we did have one get knocked over and it did not break. I wouldn’t try it on purpose, but we escaped at least once. Due to the shape of the glass, there was also less of a spill. These are better than our previous wine glasses which were very nice.  The price is not too much at all considering the product and service if needed.
"
ANP,4.0,2021 18 August,"

Emilia Tamburri,4.0,2021 14 July,"
These are attractive wine glasses. However, they need to be washed gently and handled with care. The glass is thin and breakable. If I’d known that in advance to avoid breaking the glass, I would give five stars for their look.

Daniel Lord,4.0,2020 23 July,"




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I like it how the weight of wine glass is very lite and it fells like you are not holding anything in your hand.I’m not an expert on wine glass but I was a little bit confused when it says Italian style and thinking that will be made in Italy but after I received the order the box sats it was made in China.So I’m not sure if this is considered a true Italian style wine glass or not.  Or is it just another mock knock of version of Italian style wine glass.

Amazon Customer,4.0,2021 13 April,"
I love the style and one broke from my original order ( the ice cube was too large) so I reordered the same product. Strangely, theGlass is more sturdy and the bell is larger than the first set.  Perhaps this is because they are uniquely hand made but the qualityIs very different: I prefer the more delicate first set.
"
Jung Hoon Kwon,1.0,2022 27 October,"
The tamper evident sticker was obviously torn before becuase it was loosely hanging off the box.  When I opened the box ot was obvious someone had already handled these glasses before.  Mot only are they very foggy and dirty, hut they were very slippery and quite disgusting to handle...  It seems used glasses have been sent to me, if not, then there's some serious issues at the factory.  Otherwose, it looks nice but probably very fragile.  Returning without hesitation.

They are ok. You definitely get what you pay for. I was kind of hoping for a taller glass but it really doesn’t bother me. I’m just afraid they will break soon. I’m super careful with them. Other than how they feel, they look SUPER cute and classy ❤️❤️🍷I would gift them to someone who is new to wine ☺️
"
ATL_JLC,4.0,2021 2 May,"
I'm a buyer in the packaging industry. Glasses were packaged well and arrived unscathed. Definitely not an inexpensive way to ship. Glasses are beautiful. But I'm worried about how thin they are. They feel like they're going to snap in your hand when washing.  Handle them with kid gloves.

Update: I ordered another set of glasses for a wine tasting party. One glass arrived broken. I contacted the seller and in less than a week 2 additional wine glasses arrived at my doorstep in perfect condition. I can’t say enough good things about this seller. I hope to do business with the seller again in the future.I was looking for delicate rather than thick heavy wine glasses. These were just what I wanted. Your guests will think you paid a lot for these as they look elegant and expensive despite the low price. The packaging was very good and they arrived on time and in perfect condition. I just ordered another set.
"
Shannon Marie,5.0,2021 1 May,"
Finally hung my wine rack and wanted some really beautiful red wine glasses to fill all 8 spots. I could not be more happy with these! They are absolutely beautiful, I receive so many compliments on them. They are sturdy and but thin enough to feel fancy. I made it 4 months without someone breaking one. I emailed JBHO and they sent me a replacement set that arrived THE NEXT DAY! Amazing customer service. Purchase these glasses, you will not regret it!
"
Rice5,5.0,2021 8 July,"
These wine glasses are beautiful but delicate & can break if not handled with care which is what I discovered when I hand washed & one broke when I was drying. I contacted JBHO thrush email included pics & within 2 days to my surprise they replaced not just 1 broken glass but sent me 2. How’s that for exceptional customer service! You don’t see that too often nowadays.  Will definitely reorder.

I've been on the hunt for the perfect red wine glass and I finally found it with this brand. The glass is so sturdy, one solid piece (which adds to the sturdiness), and the shape is BEAUTIFUL. I loved them so much that I ordered a second set to have.  The glasses also arrived packaged very securely. The final thing that made me give this company and these glasses five stars was the customer service. They honor the part about replacing a broken glass at no cost to you. I clumsily dropped one  and they sent me a replacement no questions asked. From now on, all my drink ware will come from this company.

What a great company with amazing customer service! First off The wine glasses are beautiful and I love the shape. It is really true that this company will replace a broken or defective glass. Two weeks after having these glasses I was washing one and the stem broke in half. I emailed the contact person and they were super responsive and mailed me a replacement glass right away. I got the replacement glass within five days! I think this is a really great company with really beautiful wine glasses that stand up to their promise of great customer service.

Long stem and graceful look, but fragile.

mer,5.0,2020 3 November,"
This company is amazing. I live in a remote part of Alaska, USA. Mail is infrequent due to weather and distance. Two beautiful wine glasses arrived and one stem had cracked. The packaging was excellent, but I blame it on the long journey here. I emailed the company and they immediately sent me replacements. Not just one glass, but two. I was SO impressed with the customer service and turn around on email response AND shipping. Thank you and I will order from your company in the future!!

They are truly amazing...idk about sturdy or durable they're glass. But they are definitely well made... going to be a repeat buyer of this brand..I hope they have some colored glasses as well...Jesus be a new wine glass cabinet...cause im going to need one.

Igor Antonio Nunes Pereira,5.0,2021 6 November,"
The glasses are amazing! I contacted the vendor about a concern I had and they promptly replied and helped me with my problem! I highly recommend this vendor!
"
Jalisa Beverly,1.0,2022 22 October,"
This is not bang for your buck. The 1st cup broke upon opening the package. Literally one touch and it shatters. The 2nd one broke while washing it gently because I knew how fragile it was. Don’t waste your money. Invest in decent glass. This can’t even be used as a one time ordeal because one bad touch and it’s broken into a bunch of pieces.
"
Pteryl Dactyl,5.0,2021 17 April,"
These delicate wine glasses are absolutely ideal for a perfect addition to one's table on all occasions  and/or celebrations with of course, a great wine. They are remarkably light and beautifully crafted so they must be handled with care. I recommend hand washing with soap & hot water, then drip drying in a rack as opposed to the typical ease of a dishwasher. Just sayin'. :-)
"
Sue T,5.0,2021 18 January,"
I wanted some stylish wine glasses with a big bowl and these are perfect! we also have some more expensive Riedel wine glasses but I much prefer the style  of these JBHO glasses.They are so well packaged. I have had these for almost 2 weeks now and they have had a lot of use use. Sturdy and go through the dishwasher easily and no problems. Highly recommend these glasses for any red wine lovers!
"
Leslie Sullivan,4.0,2020 2 October,"
The two wine glasses arrived fine with no damage. Love the shape for red wine. The glass itself is much lower quality than expected for the price. They are fragile, as was expected, however, they feel almost plastic having very little glass weight. Overall happy with the shape but disappointed in the quality.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 18 May,"
I had an issue with this product which I must had used a lot of force to wash it and it broke. I contacted the seller they explained to me about the material of the glasses and asked me my address to send a new set even just one was broken, great customer service and understanding, and the glasses are nice.
"
JEM,5.0,2021 28 April,"
I love the style and size of these wine glasses!  I wanted thin ones and these are just right!I was very impressed in the packaging!  They came in thick foam molded to the shape of each glass, then put in sturdy boxes.I may order more.My husband doesn't care for the style, but I love them!
"
coach c,3.0,2021 18 December,"
Glasses are very lightweight and break easy.  I have emailed company at JBHomeAMZ@gmail.com but have had no response yet
"
Daniel Vellone,5.0,2021 27 April,"
These are beautiful glasses, just be careful since they are thin and fragile. Haven’t broken them but I can see that one small drop or maybe putting it the wrong way in the dishwasher could break one. Either way it’s a great value and they are beautiful glasses that are great to drink wine out of!
"
Benjamin,5.0,2021 26 January,"
First off we love these glasses and use the regularly. Second the customer service is amazing. I e always hand wash all our glasses. While doing so one of the glasses had a chip that came out while washing. I contacted customer service and 2 days later had a new glass. Thank you so much for standing by your product and have a awesome customer service.
"
Evgenia Glazunova,5.0,2021 21 July,"
Excellent product! Exactly what I expected! I've been looking for this exact type of wine glasses for a while and was surprised to have found them on Amazon. They are exactly as described. Very happy with the purchase. Also, very convenient that they come in a set of two.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 19 March,"
Others have rated this product low because it is breakable. That isn't surprising with a beautiful wine glass. What was surprising was the amazing and fast customer service. I emailed them that I had broken a glass, they responded immediately to the email and I had a replacement arrive 2 days later. Thank you for doing things right, JBHO.
"
Murph,5.0,2020 17 November,"
I bought these glasses for my daughter’s 27th birthday.  She loves them!  They’re beautiful!  Even though they are sturdy glasses,  my daughter broke one while washing them before using.  I told her about the replacement policy so she wrote to the company.  They replaced her glass immediately upon receiving the order number.  We both would recommend these beautiful glasses and would purchase them again!
"
Sirus,5.0,2021 13 August,"
Im very happy with your company and the response i received when i reached out concerning a broken glass. I received 2 brand new stems within a couple days. The product is wonderfully made and i will put them to good use.
"
Faith Flaherty,2.0,2022 8 March,"
These seemed really nice at first with a beautiful shape. However, they are incredibly fragile to the point of being a waste of time. I bought two and both shattered in my hands. I don’t have strong hands and am not rough with my dishes. One shattered when being washed, the other when being towel dried. These lasted a month and a half. Not worth it at all.
"
TR,4.0,2021 16 January,"
I love the shape, but they are a little too delicate for me to feel safe using them much. I have bad luck with wine glasses. I bought some stemless that I use more often.
"
Rich & Risse,5.0,2021 21 October,"
These glasses may be delicate but are absolutely beautiful. And the customer service is just amazing. They go above and beyond. Thank you.
"
Anna Robertson,5.0,2021 8 July,"
I really love these. You can tell they are genuinely hand blown from slight imperfections making them quite charming. They are very thin and satisfing to drink from. I drink all my wine from these glasses, even though that's not the technical ""correct"" way to do it.
"
Joanne T.,5.0,2020 29 December,"
Love these glasses. Beautiful and elegant. Love drinking out of them. They are very large compared to my other wine glasses. Come beautifully packaged and fast delivery. Would make a great gift for two. I ordered them for myself because I love drinking wine. Using mine as I write this. Even makes cheap wine taste expensive. Lol I would definitely recommend.
"
Cristina,5.0,2022 14 January,"
My friend loves her gift
"
DH,4.0,2020 7 October,"
I was surprised how very thin the neck on the glasses is. The glass is beautiful but they seem so delicate that one wrong move and it will break. Hope they last longer than I think they will.
"
M.R.,5.0,2021 17 January,"
The first time we used these glasses was Christmas Eve and our guests had so many compliments.  They are an amazing deal for the price.  They are a bit more delicate than the photos indicate, but they are SO pretty.  The bowl is quite large and will hold a substantial pour.  Great find!
"
Carlos,4.0,2021 2 April,"
It's a little too big for my taste, and it seems like it would break extremely easy because of how thin it is.
"
abhi,4.0,2021 10 April,"
Great glasses, but very thin and the durability is low. Break with the slightest touch, all of my set broke eventually,
"
Michelle R.,4.0,2020 4 August,"
They have a great shape and look to them.  The packaging was very well done so they arrived in perfect condition. The glasses however are paper thin and don’t seem to be very durable so I would be careful of clinking them together.
"
Christine,5.0,2021 9 November,"
Perfect glasses for a special night abd a special bottle of wine.
"
Jared Beneroff,5.0,2020 11 May,"
I really love these glasses!  They are very pretty and I've gotten a bunch of compliments on them. The size and shape are just what I was looking for- they are large and feel good to hold.I had an issue with one of the glasses upon delivery and customer service was more than happy to send me a new set ASAP.  I would definitely recommend these glasses and I will be buying more in the future.  Thanks!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 25 March,"
We received our wine glasses promptly and they were beautiful & sturdy.  However, one of the glasses had a chip in it that made it unusable.  I contacted the merchant directly via E-Mail Message, advised of the issue with the one wine glass, and the merchant very promptly replied to my message, advising they would send me a new set of glasses.  Within days, I received a new set of wine glasses in perfect condition.  I would definitely recommend these glasses!
"
Nitro Rider,4.0,2021 20 April,"
Really nice looking. Eye catching shape. Very thin so be careful handling or these will break.
"
Ada Andrade,5.0,2021 13 August,"
The glasses are beautiful. When one of them broke I contacted their customer service and they responded immediately! I received a free replacement immediately from them. I would buy from them again!
"
Bailey Thompson,1.0,2022 22 March,"
I loved these with all my heart. The shape is exactly what I wanted, but a fly could land on them and they would break. The first one, we used warm water to wash, and the heat shattered it. They wouldn’t replace it without a picture, but we had already cleaned up the shards. We just bought more since it was $25. Two more broke back to back from the very gentle cleaning (seriously, we were GENTLE), after the corner of the brush bumped (not hit, barely bumped) the glass. The last one just shattered and we don’t even know what happened to it. The closest thing we did to it was close some blinds about a foot from them and then poof, a thousand shards.I hate when people exaggerate in reviews and we always ignore those comments and move on. Don’t ignore them here. These will not last you a month, even though they are beautiful.
"
Em Minion,5.0,2021 13 November,"
The shape is beautiful and I get many compliments about it!
"
Nancy M.,3.0,2021 22 September,"
One glass broke already and I just bought in June.  It says guaranteed but I can't find out how to get in touch with the company.
"
Charles ,5.0,2020 26 July,"
I wanted a modern red wine glass, and this one fits the bill. I could have spent more, but I would not have obtained the value I got with this glass. I could have spent less, but the style and quality were much lower. I spent a lot of time on Amazon's website looking at all of the red wine glasses and believe I made the right choice.
"
J.A. Strockbine,3.0,2021 23 October,"
My understanding of this product is that they are crystal, (although attractive) they simply they are not.
"
Klara,5.0,2021 13 September,"
I love these wine glasses. We did break them within the first week but that's on us. Loved them and getting more.
"
Mikae,5.0,2020 23 January,"
I have been wanting to have very good wine glasses for my boyfriend who doesn't have a set of glasses. All he has are collection from hotels where he stayed (Awww....lol). They are all odd shape and not very good quality. Over the holidays, I finally purchased a set for him (I needed for my 2000 Bordeaux that I wanted to open). We were presently surprised with quality and sleek looking. With this, any wine looks very expensive! The price is so affordable and can't beat.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 3 July,"
These are just stunning, beautiful look and great for red wine. I did have one them break, but it was replaced in less than a week by the seller. Love the customer support as much as much as the glasses.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 15 March,"
WOW quite the surprise. I had a minor complaint and the seller sent two additional boxes of wine glasses I am Super Impressed with the customer service. I will def use this vendor in the future and highly recommend them. Thanks  they are beautiful and packed perfectly
"
michael,5.0,2020 6 June,"
I love these glasses. Makes even crappy wine feel like an expensive one with the glass. Customer service is top notch. I clumsily broke my first 2 glasses, so I bought another set. 1 of the new glasses broke while cleaning it. I contacted them, and they sent me out 2 more glasses free of charge.  Beautiful but fragile being thin and hand blown, but well worth it!
"
Andrea,5.0,2020 18 June,"
These wine glasses are beautiful and elegant to drink out of but I have to rave about the customer service.  I had put some ice in the glass and when an ice cube hit the side it broke.  I took a picture of it and the company sent me 2 new glasses - no questions asked!  I will be buying more in the future!
"
marlena janes,5.0,2021 20 March,"
***update*** after writing the glass had broke, the company quickly sent out a replacement! Only one glass broke, but they sent the set of two after about 2 days. Great customer service!!Broke with cold Sangria, NOT durable with ice which is kind of ridiculous!
"
Josef  Morphis,5.0,2021 25 August,"
Love the bowl of the glass, it delivers the wine perfectly to your palate. Love the shape, looks very classy and very affordable
"
Rumbi M.,5.0,2020 1 November,"
Gorgeous glasses! The packaging was incredibly safe and secure, with styrofoam and extra padding outside of the box. The glasses themselves are beautiful and lightweight. I have used them a few times already and so far no issues. As far as durability, I am sure they will last depending on how careful they are handled. Would definitely purchase again.
"
Aldo A. Molina,5.0,2021 13 September,"
Copa grande para deleitar el sabor y el olor del vino. Muy buen acabado y cristal ligero.
"
TPorter,5.0,2021 18 July,"
These look and feel great. They seem quite fragile as they’re thin glass but so far they’re holding up well.  Haven’t tried them in the dishwasher have only hand washed them.
"
Oday,5.0,2021 22 May,"
These glasses are so nice, perfect for entertaining. I always get compliments on them. Be careful when handling, they are delicate but worth the handle :) Also, this company has great customer service. Very responsive and so helpful.
"
Katarena Ford,5.0,2020 9 October,"
These glasses are super cute and easily my favorite. However, they have more of a plastic feel but they break like glass. One of my glasses broke in the sink. I emailed the company and they shipped me a free set with no questions asked. They were nice and professional - 5 stars for customer service
"
DJ ,5.0,2021 12 March,"
They are quite elegant. Simply gougeous. You may need to be very gentle with them however. It’s very fine glass so I’m sure it will be easily broken, however I like how light they are. I don’t like heavy glasses when drinking wine.
"
Jasper Acosta,4.0,2020 25 August,"
These a beautiful wine glasses. It is a little thin, but so far it holds perfectly. It came in a foam box with the designers card. I would purchase again.
"
Todd,5.0,2021 25 April,"
Ordered two sets of these just before the holidays and we loved them so much, we decided to order another couple of sets.  Great quality, no bubbling or pock marks in the glass.  Would definitely recommend.
"
Alondra,5.0,2020 14 November,"
I was a little worried after reading all the reviews. I received my order today and may I say great purchase. I had been looking for something like this for a while now. Beautifully packaged and designed perfectly. To each their own but I’m buying this for all my friends this Xmas.
"
Dixie L,5.0,2020 6 February,"
If you like to ""release the esters"" &/ ""admire the legs"" you gotta check it these wine glasses.  Plus, they are as beautiful as they are functional.  A wide bowl base on a long, slender stem assures that your wine reaches your palate with maximum flavor and bouquet.  And yes, wine does taste better from crystal stems.  Frazier Crane would recommend these wine glasses, as do I.  Cheers!
"
Cassie Stebelton,4.0,2020 11 July,"
Broke very easily. I asked my husband to hand me my glass and it literally broke in his hand and cut his hand. But they are beautiful. Just be extremely careful with them!
"
Charles,5.0,2020 9 September,"
6/19/22 update: I had a wine glass break and the seller replaced it quickly and without hassle. Hands down the best experience with a seller.  If you’re looking for a well shaped and high quality wine glass, look nowhere else. Original review: Fantastic. Exactly what we were looking for. Nice and tall and high quality.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 3 October,"
I’m happy with this product for me, not as a gift.
"
BasicB,5.0,2021 5 September,"
Elegant look and feel, but also fragile as is true with most fine crystal.
"
Jimmy Wojcik,5.0,2021 14 July,"
Love the shape and size, I’m not sure how durable they are, because of the stem, but all good glasses are a little delicate.  Love them.
"
Dolly,5.0,2021 19 October,"
Great price for delicate crystal wine glasses.
"
Casey,5.0,2020 10 June,"
I haven't ever bought nice glasses for myself, usually I go to the discount section at Target but decided to splurge a bit and oh my goodness I'm glad I did. These are so lightweight I'm afraid I'll break them, but they have held up so far! Gives me a great excuse to drink some nice red wine after a long day.
"
cesar gonzalez,5.0,2021 31 January,"
Great wine glasses. They are thin so careful when washing and drying them. Although they are thin up top, the base and stem look and feel sturdy and the glass is over all very elegant. This buy was worth it
"
G,3.0,2020 29 July,"
Great shape and style of Glass. Only downfall is how thin the glass is. If its on the edge of a table when setting it down the glass is done. There is suppose to be A lifetime replacement. I have reached out since I have already broke one but I haven't heard anything back. Reason for the three stars. Ill probably just start buying glasses in person so I know the size and weight before I take them home
"
Booklover,5.0,2021 1 May,"
These are gorgeous glasses. They've become my favorite, go-to wine glasses, for either red or white. Perfect size and shape and such an elegant feel. Have already ordered more.
"
Tom Eastwood,3.0,2021 9 June,"
Wow!  These wine glasses are beautiful and the taste of our wine was much better than out of our old glasses.  However, they do not feel like crystal glass.  They feel and sound like plastic?? 😔
"
KC,4.0,2020 1 June,"
These are very nice but when I opened the box the stems where broken. If you get these glasses just be very careful with the stems; they are very thin.
"
Lavern,4.0,2021 2 February,"
Very nice but bigger than I expected. Great gift
"
Charlotte Grimmett,5.0,2020 3 June,"
These wine glasses are stunning. They have a long thin stem that’s so elegant to hold, they’re incredibly lightweight, and yet still feel so durable at the same time. I was nervous ordering glass off of amazon but they have the packaging down perfectly, I see no possible way one of these could break in transit. Fantastic product!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 12 October,"
Meet my expectations— good gift idea
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 26 November,"
I really loves these glasses , as I was pulling them out of the box my biggest fear was worrying if they'd be broken or not due to them being fragile. But they came on time and are extremely excellent . I have no complaints over hear , any time I drink wine I use these glasses and I plan on buying another set because they were so well . Thank you !
"
Cynthia,5.0,2020 23 December,"
These glasses are very pretty.  they allow for the wine to breath right in the bowl feature of the glass.  A beautiful selection of stem ware for the table and use to dress up any occasion.
"

Nice glass. It’s thin but it’s not meant to be super thick. You’re getting a classy wine glass not a beer mug 🍷
"
María Gabriela Balsa,1.0,2022 21 October,"
Both glasses broke while hand washing them! Ridiculous! I want a refund
"
veronica kon,4.0,2020 15 August,"
I like the shape and looks but they are so light and fragile. Thought they will be little heavier.
"
David Cobb,3.0,2021 13 July,"
Good shape. Very thin side walls. Had less than 2 weeks and one snapped stem. Surprised the body didnt go on them yet.
"
Pamela hillan,5.0,2021 4 July,"
Seemed very delicate and perhaps easily breakable. Packaging was excellent though.  Time will tell. Liked the size and design.
"
Alexandra Dykhuis,5.0,2020 21 September,"
I bought 2 sets of these wine glasses and absolutely love them! I did have an incident of 1 breaking while hand washing, however after contacting the seller they sent me a new set with no questions asked! Love these glasses and this company!
"
Natacha,5.0,2020 15 November,"
I searched high and los for affordable but high quality red wine glasses on Amazon and these surpassed expectations! Classic yet modern at the same time, love how the shape is subtly unique, excellent quality - will purchase more!
"
Christina Raskin,4.0,2020 22 July,"
Beautiful glasses, the only negative is they are very light so very delicate. More for special occasions than daily use
"
Lindsey,5.0,2020 2 November,"
Love love LOVE these glasses! I was washing one last night and dropped it in my sink so one sadly broke...Not the most durable (thin dainty glass) but they are amazing for drinking! Glad I still have one left lol
"
monica woodard,5.0,2021 30 April,"
Glasses are beautiful. Company is very nice and friendly! First set was destroyed during transport, the company express shipped be a new set immediately! Happy customer!
"
sophialjp,2.0,2022 16 January,"
They look good but don’t clean up well. They don’t fit in dishwasher so have to be washed by hand. I soak them with water and soap over night and then wash with wine glass mop, hot water, and soap. Never clean up perfectly.
"
carolineg,3.0,2021 27 March,"
Used these glasses a few times for wine and LOVED them. But, used one to make a Aperol spritz with ice and after putting in 2 ice cubes carefully, the glass popped out a perfect circular hole in the side. Very strange.
"
Linda,5.0,2021 13 May,"
but elegance is, and these glasses are elegant. Yes, as others have said, they require a gentle touch when washing, but they're worth it!
"
Nomacgenius,1.0,2021 26 May,"
The good:  What my wife and I like about these wine glasses is the wide bowl, which helps get a good smell of the wine and helps the wine breathe. The not so good: After about 5-6 uses and carefully washing the glasses, a glass broke.  Since we’ve owned Reidel glasses, we’ve learned how to carefully hand-wash a wine glass, so we were surprised when suddenly, while rinsing a glass, it cracked.  Per JBHO’s guarantee, we reported the breakage to them and they replaced it.  However, it happened again (see the pic).  We contacted JBHO and they said, “We are sorry that we cannot help you. Order: 113……. has been applied for after-sale replacement service through the Amazon system.“. They were referencing the replacement for the first breakage!  I explained to them in 2 separate emails the mistake they were making, but no luck (they didn’t even respond the second time).  So, although it’s a nice glass, because of its fragile, thin style, and lack of customer support, I wouldn’t recommend it.
"
Don Quick,5.0,2021 5 October,"

Katelyn Brech,5.0,2020 25 October,"
I am over the moon about these wine glasses! They are beautiful. I have upped my wine intake since I bought them because I love them so much. Very delicate but holds up. I have been recommending them to everyone!!
"
Sarah,5.0,2021 24 January,"
They’re gorgeous. But, very thin and super lightweight. Perfect glasses, actually, just not much substance to them and unfortunately they met their doom rather quickly. But, I’ll be buying another set regardless
"
RKR,5.0,2021 30 July,"
Elegant Italian hand blown wine glasses. Makes you feel special when enjoying your wine.
"
Egbert Bradley,5.0,2020 2 June,"
The glasses arrived today in perfect condition--no cracks, chips, or defects of any kind. I drink white wine and don't care if these are supposed to be for red wine. I drink out of glasses with a pleasing shape and a generous volume. The shape and volume of these are perfect
"
Danielle Duncan,5.0,2021 14 April,"
These are beautiful and perfect and I LOVE LOVE LOVE them, I would but more anytime any day just don't have an occasion right now.
"
Jill McHugh,5.0,2021 5 January,"
I love the look of these glasses and I really like how large they are. They are thin like many mentioned but if you take care of them they should last. Definitely recommend.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 13 January,"
They look durable - and are a very nice shape and size - they were a gift and I just spoke with the person I gifted them to and she loves them.

"
Karla V,5.0,2020 27 June,"
Beautiful glasses! I bought 4, now buying 4 more! Packaging was perfect, there was no damage on the glasses themselves or the boxes they arrived in. I’m obsessed! Can’t wait to serve everyone wine in these glasses. They are very fragile, so I will be hand washing them.
"
Andrea Fortaleza,5.0,2021 26 April,"
These glasses are stunning however for the price I wish I would have at least gotten  a set of 4

Love these wine glasses, poured a glass of Bordeaux. Decanted well and was light and easy to hold while socializing.
"
danielle,3.0,2020 8 June,"
Hi guys! Be weary if you are looking for glasses with the material of crystal here, these feel like they are some material between glass and plastic, very durable, but nothing like some of my nice dinner party glasses I was looking for a substitute for (crate and barrel) beautiful design, but not the material I was expecting to get for the price.
"
blair morrow,5.0,2020 27 March,"
These are the only wine glasses I’ll ever buy again! The wine glasses themselves are stylish and amazing, but the best part is the fabulous customer service. The wine glasses are very sturdy, but if you do happen to break one, all it takes is one email and they send you a replacement.
"
Ilovedeyto,5.0,2021 25 February,"
These glasses are absolutely stunning - just using these glasses makes it an enjoyable experience having a nice glass of wine. I highly recommend them!
"
Lucas Trujillo,3.0,2021 19 April,"

We were told there was a product guarantee on this product- burgundy wine glass. We broke the stem on one washing it and would like the replacement as promised.
"
Rachel,5.0,2020 22 August,"
Beautiful, thin-lipped, well-balanced, elegantly lightweight glasses. Yes, they are delicate and fragile but fine wine glasses should be. I did have one break but the seller was very responsive and quick to replace the glass. I couldn’t be happier.

"
slwebstar!,5.0,2021 14 April,"
These are very pretty and well made. I recommend hand wash and not dishwasher, to extend life of glasses.
"
Dominique McCary,5.0,2021 27 May,"
Bought this back in March and I still have both glasses in good shape
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 28 July,"
These are the perfect red wine glasses that I desperately needed. The hand blown style looks/feels so nice. Highly recommend. I just wish it came in a pack of four, but I will definitely be ordering some more soon!
"
Maia F.,5.0,2021 27 March,"
Love these wine glasses! One of my favorites! Absolutely would recommend if you like a larger sized wine glass.
"
ullamou,5.0,2021 3 March,"
Packaged very nicely. The feel of the glass seems pretty sturdy and nice to the touch. Beautiful quality!! Thank You!!
"
Robert,5.0,2020 21 September,"
These were to replace a similar set from a different manufacturer. These are just a nice if not nicer. They do seem fragile but that is as expected for this type of stemware.
"
Sue D,5.0,2020 4 August,"
These glasses are elegant yet sturdy, and we love the quality. Been used many times and washed many times since we purchased them. They make sharing a glass of wine with loved ones a pleasure indeed.
"
Mom,5.0,2020 30 July,"
I love these glasses! They are so beautiful, lightweight, and all of my friends say they love them when they come over. Customer service is also amazing, and they sent me a new pair when mine broke.
"
Happy Customer,5.0,2021 7 March,"
Both East for my daughter for Christmas she absolutely loves them I will be buying some again for myself
"
Bart,1.0,2022 20 August,"
I read reviews for these and should have stayed away. I’ve barely had the glasses and with one gentle hand washing it is BROKEN. The glass is shattered. Waste of money. Look elsewhere.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 21 July,"
I absolutely love these glasses will purchase more soon
"
Vlad,5.0,2021 7 August,"
Long stemmed, thin rimmed, elegant. Simple.

A good buy, recommended!
"
David O.,5.0,2020 27 November,"
Everyone loved my new wine glasses.  I actually knocked one over and it did not break.  I plan on buying more of those glasses.
"
Jesse,1.0,2022 9 September,"
The glasses look great but one of the 4 glasses I ordered cracked after 3 uses and is unusable. Disappointed with the purchase.
"
Anonymous,5.0,2021 15 June,"
Great purchase! Just the kind of wine glasses I've been looking for!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 31 May,"
Absolutely in love with these glasses ! Also very happy with their replacement guarantee because one did break. However they replaced the glass with no questions asked and it was delivered within a few days! Great product and great company.
"
Momoo The Mom,5.0,2021 20 March,"
They are nice; they were loved as a gift, but so very light and easily broken.
"
C Seay,1.0,2022 27 July,"
I've used and hand washed crystal glasses for decades. Gently hand washed when I received. Day 2 had a glass of wine and gently washed and the glass shattered, glass everywhere and of course a couple of cuts. Next time will buy those unbreakable wine glasses.
"
Ryan Jensen,2.0,2022 3 May,"
Perfect size….  They just break really really easy.
"
salegirl,5.0,2020 5 September,"
Beautiful, but delicate, crystal.  They come very well packaged in foam.  The glasses are gorgeous and designed so the wine won’t spill even if you bump the glass.
"
Danelle Abrams,5.0,2021 26 February,"
Received these wind glasses with no damage at all. No fleas, lightweight and larger than I expected.
"
Denise M.,5.0,2021 7 April,"
Beautiful large glasses! Glass is extremely thin so very very easily breakable. Loved them!!!
"
Rick,5.0,2019 17 November,"
These are great wine glasses!  I was looking for a sturdy, yet attractive, Burgundy glass, and I found it!  They seem more fragile than other glasses but are actually pretty sturdy. They are also great glasses to enhance the aromas of the wine. I'm looking forward to checking out their other glasses!
"
Nicole,4.0,2019 29 August,"
We really like these glasses. They do seem delicate and light, but they’re gorgeous. Quick delivery and all perfectly in tact. We ordered 6 and they were all perfect. I would recommend.
"
diane bagarella,1.0,2022 4 September,"
These are beautiful glasses, but unfortunately they BOTH broke in the first week, while I was handwashing them. I am so disappointed.
"
Annette long,5.0,2021 18 May,"
These glasses are light weight and huge. Very satisfied with them
"
Lee,5.0,2020 7 February,"
I LOVE these glasses and will buy more!! Love the feel, look, style. However...I cannot speak to durability or sturdiness. Honestly, they feel so dainty (though large bowl and bulbus) and fragile. I just treat them gently and enjoy them till the day comes 😬
"
Monica Flores,1.0,2022 2 October,"
This came in broken.I was very disappointed
"
Kelly Vieira,5.0,2020 16 July,"
These glasses are elegant. The stem is very dainty. I would recommend these glasses as they aerate the wine very well. I've had no issues with the glass trying to tip over.
"
mimi,5.0,2020 21 May,"
I love these glasses so I ordered two more sets.  This set was never es delivered to my home.  I’m sure someone received them.  Was t me.  My 3rd set arrives today
"
Christopher Durham,5.0,2020 21 May,"
Beautiful wine glasses and great customer service! One of the glasses was broken when it arrived and they sent me a new set right away and without any problems. Love the glasses, definitely worth the money!
"
Kirk M,5.0,2021 3 June,"
Thin and perfect!  Well worth the price!
"
Melisa A.,3.0,2021 28 February,"
Beautiful design and quality. Carefully check the glasses. I got one damaged. The packaging was really good, so I guess it was a manufacture issue.
"
Alexa Knight,5.0,2021 4 March,"
Beautiful wine glasses and fantastic customer service.  They are packed so awesomely!
"
Whitney S.,2.0,2021 24 July,"
Durability is absolutely horrible. After hand washing I set the glass upside down in the dish rack to dry, it fell over and broke. Same thing with the second one, except it was sitting in the sink waiting to be washed and my daughter threw a plastic spoon into the sink and it broke the glass.Two stars because the shape was great for aerating cab and pinot.
"
Jenny Pye,5.0,2021 8 March,"
Love, love, love these. My wine taste so good from this beautiful glass.
"
sjessick,5.0,2020 25 February,"
Bought these, and a wine aerator, for my mom, for her Christmas/Bday gift this past 2019. It's now March, 2020. She uses them almost every night, says they look super fancy, and are currently her favorite wine glasses :) I'm happy.
"
mzkia,5.0,2020 29 October,"
These glasses are so beautiful. I bought 2 boxes for my sister as a house warming gift and she loved them.
"
AB,3.0,2020 27 July,"
These glasses are fine but a bit overpriced IMO for wine glasses made in China.  I would not have bought them if the listing clearly stated that these were made in China as shows on the box I received.
"
Danny B,5.0,2021 10 February,"
Excellent glasses! Light weight, thin, crystal one piece glass really enhances the wine experience.
"
Meisha Kinnard,5.0,2020 16 September,"
I love my glasses, but they are extremely thin! I have to be extra careful with them, but that would be my only complaint.
"
Lou,5.0,2020 25 December,"
It’s light weight. Real Crystal glass. Love it!!! Looking forward for a glass of red wine.
"
Amazon Customer,2.0,2020 28 October,"
I really like these glasses to enjoy my red wine, but one of them broke while I was just holding it in the sink to wash. I was not squeezing or putting pressure on it, but it still broke. Originally when I bought these glasses, it was listed as lifetime warranty that there'd be a replacement if anything happened to it which was the reason why I even purchased them in the first place, but now I see the policy is a 1 year warranty. I'd love to continue to support, so please advise.
"
BMoore,5.0,2020 1 May,"
I received my glasses today. Encased in foam and boxed with no room. I can not image how these come broken. I am in love and can not wait to use my beautiful glasses.
"
Rebekah Sanchez,5.0,2021 21 March,"
Very thin! So be careful! I like these glasses a lot.
"
Alyssa,5.0,2020 16 April,"
Love these glasses. They are beautiful and great quality. Also appreciated the great customer service and reach out from the company. Highly recommend if you are looking for a sophisticated wine glass of good quality.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2020 23 September,"
I do like the size and shape of these wine glasses but they are very thin. I have to be very careful washing them because I feel these could break at any moment.
"
Gwendolyn Broady,1.0,2022 13 July,"
Product is NOT glass.  It’s freakin plastic.  Do not buy.  I now have to wrap this cheap crap to return for a refund.  Such a waste of time.  Amazon you need to do better
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 10 January,"
My wife and I love the quality and shine there so cute .! ❤️
"
Chelsea,4.0,2020 3 January,"
We have had these for several months and they hold up very well!
"
Sarah Villella,3.0,2020 7 May,"
Both glasses have a very noticeable imperfections, right out the box. The glasses are also extra light-weight, i fear break them just placing them in the sink. I waited a month to receive, so i’d rather use them instead of hassle with exchanging.
"
Aubrey,5.0,2021 24 May,"
Love these large beautiful wine glasses!!
"
Isvian,5.0,2020 31 December,"
The perfect size for me to finish a whole bottle in two cups ☺️☺️😂
"
Meg Doo,5.0,2020 29 December,"
My mom loves these! They are huge which is great and very nice shape
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2020 9 December,"
These glasses are cute they they break way too easy. I’ve purchased these twice and both times the glasses cracked. They’re too fragile
"
Casey,1.0,2022 7 July,"
Worthless. So thin that they break at the slightest touch. One was broke in the box. Set up a return and then just decided to use the other one. It broke the second a bottle touched the rim.
"
Chris,2.0,2021 14 November,"
Aside from being paper thin (2 out of 4 already broken within a few months) the openings are too small and feel very awkward on the mouth. I’ll stick to a standard Bordeaux.
"
Boatdog,5.0,2020 21 January,"
Amazing wine glasses for the price. Bought them to have extra on hand at our ski chalet for guest. They were very securely packaged and so elegant we will use them as primary wine glasses! Thank you.
"
Julie Campbell,5.0,2020 14 September,"
Love these but they are very delicate, kept the box they came in so they can be protected.

"
Molly Margaret Johnson,5.0,2020 26 December,"
beautiful! def worth it for the low price and how chic they look
"
TNagel,5.0,2019 13 June,"
Did a taste test using regular wine glasses and the JBHome Burgundy Wine Glasses and found that red wine actually tastes smoother and smells better when using these larger, taller glasses. Ordered eight glasses and one arrived broken. Contacted JB Home directly and they promptly replaced the broken glass in two days. Great customer service and great product. Highly recommend!
"
BW,5.0,2020 29 March,"
The product arrived on time and in great shape.  The quality and price is much better comparing to retail shops. Can't wait till I swirl my wine in the glass!
"
Kimberly H,3.0,2020 24 May,"
Beautiful glasses. However one of mine broke at the stem on the second use when I was drying it after rinsing it. I’m not that strong and apparently neither is the glass. But they are so beautiful.
"
Stater,5.0,2021 17 May,"
Feel nice in hand.
"
Susan G.,5.0,2019 26 June,"
I ordered a pair of these glasses but one of them arrived broken. The box didn't have any Styrofoam to protect the glasses nor was it marked fragile.  I'm going to order another pair and hopefully this time they both arrive in good condition.  These glasses are elegant and look very expensive.
"
Katie M.,1.0,2022 13 July,"
Thought it was me that was at fault for breaking the wine glass. My daughter did the same thing, by just placing in the sink for of dish water.  Wouldn’t recommend
"
sammymac,5.0,2021 8 April,"
The glass is of good quality
"
G. Smith,5.0,2019 28 December,"
Very good looking glasses. Feels sturdy and high quality. I will buy more. The packaging was well done too. I saved my box so I could throw theses in the truck to take to the beach.
"
Empowerer,5.0,2020 30 January,"
Holding the glass feels great and the wine looks amazing in them.  I truly enjoy using them, and they feel amazing to hold with good balance.  You won't be disappointed.  Enjoy!
"
Mckenzie S.,4.0,2020 1 April,"
Beautiful but extremely fragile
"
Michelle Anderson,3.0,2021 10 February,"
Glasses are okay. The stem is not as long as I anticipated.
"
jennifer,3.0,2020 25 May,"
They break REALLY easy!!! other then that they were my favorite wine glasses however, the stem is just wayyy too thin . Would i purchase again? If they were more stronger i totally would.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 28 July,"
Packaged very carefully so that they wouldn’t break and they are just beautiful wine glasses for a great price!
"
N. DeMilto,5.0,2021 6 February,"
Beautiful glassware! Just what I was looking for!
"
Richelle Nelson,3.0,2021 26 February,"
Wish the stems were a bit longer. Other than that glasses good!
"
Sarah,2.0,2021 28 March,"
I really liked the look of these glasses and size. But they are paper thin glass, not strong at all. One came with a black spot on it I tried washing it and it didn’t come off. In fact, the glass straight up broke in my hands while gently scrubbing. The second glass broke two days later being set down not gentle enough.
"
Emily Broussard,5.0,2021 15 February,"

Katie Overstreet ,5.0,2021 27 January,"
Beautiful boxing and thin glass work 🍷
"
Elizabeth Crocker,1.0,2022 30 April,"
these are truly the worst wine glasses i’ve ever purchased. BOTH of them broke while i was pouring wine into them (on different occasions). i’ve had wine glasses from the $1 bin at target last longer. my husband is military and we move 2x a year, so that’s saying something. don’t buy these.
"
Dennis P.,5.0,2019 12 December,"
Purchased as a Christmas Gift Exchange.  Could tell when we received and inspected the glasses that they were very nice. The loved the glasses and they will be put to good use.
"

"
ashleigh,5.0,2020 4 August,"
I absolutely love it. It looks beautiful for red or whites. My new favorite wine glass!!
"
Tina B,2.0,2021 18 July,"
Feels so cheap. Being hand-blown I expected them to be special and have some weight. They don’t. They feel like plastic. I bought for present and was going to etch and I waited too long to open the box so I can return. These feel very cheap and plastic. Not special.
"
Krista filek,5.0,2020 3 February,"
Love these wine glasses! Just ordered another pair-had my first pair for a few months and decided it was worth it for some more. Beautiful and lightweight!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 22 April,"

"
Amazon Customer,2.0,2021 13 August,"
My wife loved these glasses, however we were sitting on the couch and she picked the glass up and it literally busted into pieces. Wine everywhere....cut finger.....huge mess. I'm not sure if this is a freak thing, but I've never seen anything like it.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 16 September,"
I would recommend these glasses. they are light but very durable.
"
Biker monkey,2.0,2021 31 July,"
These are $5 stems being sold for $15.  A good stemmed wine glass should weigh at least 8 oz, these guys weigh 4.8 ounces.  You can immediately tell the difference hold them... very poor quality for the price.I returned mine.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2020 26 June,"
Just okay... I bought these glasses looking for the best value for the money and was underwhelmed based on the price.
"
Marshy,3.0,2021 30 March,"
Very fragile
"

"
KBW,3.0,2020 7 February,"
one of two had a small bubble on the wall of the glass...  if I had bad eyes, it would not have bothered me but its annoying when I see it

They’re very nice but not durable whatsoever. It doesn’t take much at all for them to shatter. Would not recommend!
"
JP,5.0,2020 22 March,"
I haven’t used them very much but they are pretty, they fit the part and I haven’t broken them.

"
Jamie LB,1.0,2022 21 April,"
The glasses are so fragile that upon cleaning one after viewing with wine in it, shattered in my hand!  Definitely NOT Safe. They are much larger than I thought them to be. Would certainly Not give as a gift.
"
Shelia ,5.0,2020 19 January,"
The wine glasses are fabulous and of great quality. you can use them daily. they are a class act. I love them

Very pretty, and feels good, but fragile
"
Susan H,2.0,2021 23 January,"
Such a beautiful glass. However, after the second use as I was gently hand washing it, the glass literally shattered!  We were surprised at how ""light"" this glass was considering it's large size.  Very pretty to look at but actually seemed like the weight of plastic when picked up.  Very disappointed.
"
Hugguette,1.0,2022 9 August,"
Broke on the same day
"
Mr. Magoo,5.0,2020 15 June,"
Came in box, exactly as described. Very well packaged. Showed up on time.
"
Matthew R Lehmkuhler,1.0,2022 16 February,"
Hand washing with a dish rag and the glass broke in my hand. Contacted customer service and they said since they were over a year old they wouldn’t replace them. I agree if it was dropped but hand washing…. After the first time using them…..  not one but two of their glasses.  pretty cheap materials there. Stay away from this company.
"
Taft,1.0,2021 17 April,"
I bought a pair of these wine glasses with plans to buy more if I liked them. The glasses are beautiful and light weight. I think their weight may be a big problem. The second time I used one it shattered in my hand. I was cleaning the glass and it blew up. I know how to handle glass ware. Very gently. I was not holding the glass by the stem.The bowl just shattered into pieces. I have used Riedel for over 40 years and never had this happen. I am tossing the other glass. I feel very fortunate my hand was not cut.
"

GeriAnne,1.0,2021 3 December,"
Do NOT waste your $$ on these! I saw an Instagram influencer use them and Altho they look beautiful they are garbage! One of mine cracked immediately after a few uses. I kept using its twin but literally just cracked it a few moments while hand washing it which is what motivated me to write this for the next potential buyer. Actually they have a plasticky feel. Please don’t waste your $ on these terrible wine glasses. Ugh!!
"
Tom Kisor,5.0,2020 2 February,"

Alicia Laughlin,3.0,2020 16 April,"
They are very lightweight and thin. Beautiful glasses, but I fear that they will break easily.
"
CC,1.0,2022 8 February,"
These glasses are incredibly light. That might seem like a good thing but actually when you put liquid in them the liquid makes it top-heavy so it’s easy to spill and difficult to navigate. One of mine has broken already and I’ve only had it a few days. Not worth it.
"
Sergiu,4.0,2019 17 August,"
4 star
"
nl,2.0,2021 24 March,"
They are gorgeous to look at. But like other purchasers, I broke one within 5 mins of receiving it because its SO thin. I was gentle with it too. So... I have one. We'll see how long it lasts.
"
Sandra Stevens,5.0,2020 31 May,"

"
Jaclyn Watson,1.0,2022 15 March,"
The glasses came in and I pulled them out of the box. One of the glasses broke at the stem during the initial wash. Very gently washed the second. Don't think it will last very long.

"
Jake “the snake” Roberts,2.0,2021 21 June,"
Broke after a few uses, shattered bad. Box says it has a lifetime guarantee but there doesn’t seem to be a way to contact the company to get a replacement glass.
"
Kindle Customer,1.0,2022 2 May,"
The glasses were beautiful, but one broke the first day I used it. Very disappointing, as hand blown glass is usually much more sturdy.

Eclectic Reader,1.0,2021 6 May,"
These are lovely glasses, but they are just TOO fragile! The two I purchased are already broken. Had them less than 6 weeks. The first shattered as I was hand washing it. I mean it literally crumbled in my hands. The second cracked when I put ice cubes in it. Again, I placed them in. The ice cubes did not come shooting out an automatic fridge dispenser. I am so disappointed, and kinda mad because these might as well have been disposable, I. ran through them so fast.

S&H,1.0,2021 24 March,"
Always read the 1's and 2's in the reviews. I find them more helpful than the pumped-up 5s. Wine glass broke by barely holding it carefully while washing it. Even if you lightly tap this wine glass, it will break at the stem. I'm returning this as defective. If you want an attractive wine glass that simply sits on a shelf for view, this would be fine. If you are going to use them or wash them, high chance they will break. FYI. Don't make me say ""I told ya so.""

"
Julia,1.0,2021 25 December,"
Glasses are very attractive however came with etches on the globes and extremely thin.  They advertise Italian Handblown Glass yet box says Made in China, AND there’s a crease in one of the globes (which I can’t seem to get in a picture for this review) as if it was made in a mold!!?Buyers Beware

This item is was very nice upon unpackaging, but I used it once, washed it, and on the 2nd use I had 3 pieces of ice inside with wine and a chunk of the middle of the glass broke out.Considering the price, the quality of these is not up to par. Very disappointed.

"
Lucinda Bergins,1.0,2020 13 July,"
Oh no, I’m so extremely disappointed. I’m a huge crystal glassware fanatic. I am building a collection and have been happy with most items from amazon. However, I received these glasses today and thought it be great with my Italian dinner and wine tonight. I washed them gently and dried with my glass cloth, the wine glass literally broke into pieces in my hand, the other one was wine at the same handling. This came as a shock to me. I’m not sure if the item is defective or if this is just a weak product. This has never happened to me before.
"
Joe La,2.0,2021 9 April,"
It says that these glasses are tough to break. I've broken two of them and I take care of my things. Never again!
"
B416G64,2.0,2020 27 October,"
I bought 2 sets-4 glasses and the first one broke right away. I was barely touching it. Two others soon followed. They look and feel very nice, but they are unreasonably fragile. I was so careful.
"

"
Amazon Customer,2.0,2020 14 July,"
Loved the shape and feel of these glasses but both of them broke within the first and second use! So fragile!! And I even washed them by hand and was very careful but didn’t help, and now I’m out the money and the glasses!
"
Neumahn,2.0,2021 13 January,"
These wine glasses are beautiful and we really loved them until they broke.  One just broke in my hand while I was drying it with a towel.
"
Amanda ST,2.0,2021 22 April,"

"
QalaLover,2.0,2019 22 November,"
I ordered these as a gift for a colleague. I'm so glad I didn't ship them straight to him. These are not delicate crystal glasses as described. I was hoping for something comparable to a Reidel glass like others had described. These are so heavy and chunky, they've got to be pure glass, not crystal at all. They're going back.
"
Latrice Reed,1.0,2022 7 April,"
One of the glasses broke already because glass was so thin. I wouldn’t recommend!!!
"
Levi ,2.0,2020 23 September,"

Jasna Ortagus,1.0,2021 6 October,"
The glasses look  really pretty but are horrible quality. I had one break in my hand while washing it. It didn’t hit the counter or anything I just squeezed it a little to hold it bc my hands were soapy and it just broke In half. 😔

Ana D.,1.0,2021 18 December,"
One of them shattered in my hands when I was cleaning the rim. Was using the same force as washing other glasses. Very pretty but would have purchased something more strong
"
Alexandra G,2.0,2020 3 October,"
Cheap glasses for an expensive price. They have to be made out of plastic as I dropped one by accident and it didn’t break or crack.
"
Sean P. Melia,2.0,2020 5 April,"
I accidentally bought the set of 2 rather than the set of 4, which means I paid over $10/glass.  Not worth it!  I'm not expecting these glasses to last more than a few months.

"
Kindle Customer,2.0,2021 21 January,"
This product is extremely thin and breaks without warning. It is not worth the money.
"
JGamble,1.0,2020 22 December,"
Loved the way the glass looked but one arrived shattered and the other broke while hand washing. I’ve only had the surviving glass for a couple of weeks before it shattered in my hands while hand washing. Thankfully I didn’t suffer any injury and only the glass shattered in the basin of my sink but it was disappointing. I cannot recommend these poor quality glasses. Look elsewhere.
"
Krystal Lunsford,2.0,2019 18 June,"
Very low quality glasses. They look and feel cheap. The glass isn’t very clear and smudges up with every touch. By the time you finish drinking a glass of wine, the glass is completely smudged and unable to wipe off. I would not recommend these glasses.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 31 December,"
Great product
"
Michele S.,1.0,2019 24 December,"
I washed these glasses and put my hand inside one of them to dry it with a standard dish towel and it broke into many pieces. I was not exerting undue pressure when this happened.  Needless to say I didn’t attempt to dry the other glass I am not sure how long it will last but I’m certain not long as I picked up the pieces I could tell that they were paperthin. I love a nice thin crystal wine glass but that was ridiculous.

"
Gina De Stefano,1.0,2021 15 February,"
I’m so sad! I thought these were durable wine glasses! They came in a beautiful case and they both broke in a month of having them! I never dropped them and used them according to directions and both cracked randomly! I wish I could return but I had to throw both out :(
"
Swiftlink,1.0,2021 30 September,"

VLee,1.0,2020 4 August,"
The glasses are beautiful but very thin! I ordered one set. Got them, loved the look so much I ordered an extra set for a small dinner I was having. Within the first week of having them I broke 3 of the 4!!! I love nice wine glasses and really wished these were made with more durability. I wasted 40 bucks, as I am left with one glass only after one week of use!

Got these glasses less than 1 month ago. Within 2weeks I found a crack in one glass. I only hand wash these glasses. And today, as I was hand drying the other glass, it shattered in my hand. I wasn’t convinced these were glass when they arrived. They didn’t have that glass ring but after it broke in my hand, I know they are glass. Would not recommend.
"
FromCT,1.0,2020 14 December,"
So Fragile!  Bought 8 of these “beautiful to look at” wine glasses. While lovely in appearance, they are so very fragile. The simple act of hand washing them caused two of them to break. The glass is very thin and these glasses are not suitable for everyday use.

Kim Vaughn,1.0,2020 17 June,"
They're very pretty and fun wine glasses but they are incredibly thin. I had them for a few days before my mom accidentally hit hers with her phone and it immediately shattered. Then, only two days later, I poured a drink in mine and an ice cube poked a hole in it and suddenly everything poured out. Unfortunate wast of money. :/
"
JackK,5.0,2019 17 August,"
Great
"
praine,1.0,2020 10 August,"
These glasses are sooooo thin. Just holding one feels like it will shatter!!  They come packaged sandwiched in a thick foam, which is great. So I decided to store my glasses in this protective foam....my glass shattered simply by gently placing it back in the foam!!  Granted they didn't cost much...but NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!
"

These cups almost have Oreo thins beat. The thinnest glass I’ve never seen. Do not recommend for a gift, they’ll definitely call you a,”cheap skate”

Well, I had them a week before I broke one hand washing it. I am a red wine drinker and always wash my glasses by hand and every once in a while I might have one break but I’ve never had one just last a week -they’re very thin. I am not a bull in a China shop I have a lot of breakables and I don’t usually break things that easy so I was a little surprised.  I’m going to get another pair and see how it goes. I do like the glass shape.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 28 June,"
Received the first order and one of the glasses had broken. We reached out to customer service and receive new glasses within a few days.  Excellent customer service! We will definitely buy from them again
"
Anna,5.0,2021 27 May,"
These glasses are soooo nice.  Sent them as a gift. I had the opportunity to drink some wine from one and they are of high quality.  The ""clinking"" sound for a toast is superb.  I know that seems like a weird compliment, but once you do it with these glasses, you'll understand.  I now want a set for my house.

Loekie,5.0,2021 3 May,"
This was a present for someone, from a bridal shower registry.  Can't give opinion.  But since it was on recipients registry, I assume they like it.
"
DasK,3.0,2021 6 May,"
I got the glasses as a birthday gift and they really are beautiful but I only got to use one of them one time and it broke while I was hand washing it, the second one broke while I was washing it out for the first time before I even got to use it. So in terms of durability and sturdiness I only gave it one star as that are very thin and delicate and doesn't take much for them to break.I'm very disappointed that I barely got to use this gift.I emailed the company and I haven't heard back yet. I am hoping that that will replace them for me.

"
Stella chambers,3.0,2021 5 May,"
Bought this as a mother's day gift. One came with the stem broken and the box was perfectly fine. I am so scared of the durability and that the second glass will break easily and that i have wasted my money. Idk how to contact the seller because I don't really want to go through the whole process of returning one broken glass.

"
Jackie Skye,5.0,2021 25 September,"
These glasses are gorgeous. Have I used them yet? No. Am I going to use them soon? Oh, most definitely. I’m a little saddened there were only two glasses for that price but totally my fault for not reading properly. The card that comes with these glasses is the most legit business card I’ve seen. Seriously, it’s made of unicorn tears or something because it’s so soft and smooth. The packaging is legit- love me some good ol’ Fort Knox style safety packaging and this was exactly that. I’ll update if anything goes wrong but for now… I’m a satisfied customer.P.S. the card said to leave a review in a neutral manner but I just couldn’t not include some of these strong adjectives.
"
kapplejack,4.0,2020 3 September,"
I feel so fancy when sipping wine from these glasses! The shape is lovely and looks expensive. They are easy to clean, easy to store, and they were packaged very well in shipping. They are on the thin side, so I worry that if I ever knocked the stem into something that it would snap off easily, and they certainly would not survive a fall from even a foot off the ground. However, I love the look of them and would buy more if I ever do break one.
"
A. Cheek,5.0,2021 26 September,"
Love these wine glasses. They’re beautifully crafted. We received our first set and loved them so much that we ordered a second. Being hand blown, each set has slightly different thickness levels. When we received the second set, one of the stems was so thin that it snapped getting it out of the box. I contacted the seller and they were swift at replacing the set. I would definitely recommend purchasing, and I’ll prob continue to buy more to add to our collection. They also make a beautiful gift.
"
Carly krueger,4.0,2020 21 April,"
I loved these wine glasses and ordered 2 sets so a total of 4 glasses. They are large and perfect for my reds. They arrived today and two out of four have scratches on them. I contacted the sellers and they are replacing them. Wonderful customer service!
"
bmo,5.0,2020 30 March,"
One of the glasses was damaged in transit. The company responded to me immediately and began the replacement process. I got the new glass within a few days.On to the glasses - they are beautiful. Thin glass, no lip, great balance and feel. I think they'd hold up to glasses 3 or 4 times their price in comparison. I am really happy with them and will likely buy more int he future.Thank you!
"
Erica Grant,5.0,2020 10 September,"
Omg these are so beautiful!! I bought this for a potential dinner party but I have no friends. I’ll probably do a wine tasting by myself. One glass red and the other white.. now I’m on to something ill get dressed and make one of those board things!.. off to Michaels
"
Carabella RIazzo,5.0,2020 14 August,"
I'm not very impressed by sellers anymore, but these glasses are excellent. Thick safe packaging, none of my glasses came broken & I ordered 3 boxes. Loved the fragile label on the box. I can't wait to use them!
"
Michael ,5.0,2020 2 July,"
Bought two glasses. Love everything about them. There was a bubble in one. They give you a contact card in the box. So I was going to write about the bubble, but the address doesn’t link to anything. So ill live with it. But really these glasses are beautiful and a bargain!

This has to be the worst purchased I’ve ever made. I literally just got my cup a min ago I went to wash it so I could use it and it broke while washing it. I was very gentle because the material is very cheap and still broke. Do not waste your money, do not fall for these fake reviews saying “this great and very durable”. They probably got store credit to give a fake review. I’m so mad I wasted my money on these when I could’ve had gotten a better option at target.

Aaron,4.0,2021 4 October,"
Expensive and high-quality, just like the red Burgundy they are designed for -Wine is not an affordable pleasure in life since the Trump tariffs and Covid inflation and climate crisis’ driving up alcohol percentages and causing drought, delivering a blow to winemakers. Wine lovers foot the bill.
"
steve won,5.0,2021 26 October,"
I originally gave it a poor rating because the lack of sturdiness. The customer reached out to me explain how the glass are made and also offered to replace it free of charge. Therefore, I can’t complain about their service as they were really friendly. The glass has been great this time around. Thank You!

Tori,4.0,2021 27 February,"
So, I was on the hunt for some very wide hipped wine glasses because I just love how they look. These kept coming up when I searched for them and after I read the reviews I just got them. You can’t tell from the photos but trust me, they are VERY wide at the hip and so gorgeous! Did not come broken, and nice thin stem. If you are thinking about getting these and you like a nice wide bowl, DO SO!!EDIT: About a day ago my mom went to wash one of the glasses and it unfortunately shattered in her hand. I came to realize that these are maybe more plastic than glass? Definitely not the best quality.ANOTHER UPDATE: Reached out to seller and got 2 more THE NEXT DAY! Awesome customer service. I would just advise that you be super super careful with these when cleaning and handling.

I love these wine glasses they’re elegant and delicate. I can’t speak to the durability, I actually don’t think they’re durable at all. But the arrived in tact and haven’t broken yet. I don’t think they’ll last forever, someone will break these eventually. Just enjoy them while they last.
"
Lettie ×o,4.0,2021 30 March,"
Absolutely beautiful! And huge! Love drinking my red wine out of them, however they are VERY DANGEROUSLY THIN! I’ll break one soon, I know it. But if you’re not clumsy like me it’s definitely worth the purchase.

Jana A.,5.0,2021 8 October,"
Needed to replace some Riedel red wine glasses that developed an ire-movable fog (I tried everything!) I like the shape and bought 6 total so 3 boxes 2 glasses per box. The packaging was extraordinary and all 6 glasses were in perfect condition. When you run your finger around the base or lip of the glass it sings. These are crystal and fragile so will be hand washing these glasses as I want them to last.
"
Wendy Schuller,5.0,2021 16 August,"
They sent me a free wine glass when one of the glasses I ordered had a small defect. The glass I ordered had a small black dot that I wasn't sure would come off when washing. I told the company and they quickly set me a replacement glass AND another free glass for the trouble. Now I have a set of 6 glasses! On top of that, the email they responded with was so sweet and personal. They hoped my family was safe during the pandemic. How sweet! Love the company and the glasses are GORGEOUS!

Meg Zarnick,4.0,2021 17 February,"
I would have given these a 4-5 star for their beauty but to fragile. I had these for less than a year, alway hand washed and dried. Noticed the other that glass was cracked and a section of the glass popped out when I touched with finger. Should not have happened. Disappointing. Would have to give a 1 star because of this.

I've had these for a little over a month and have always been extremely gentle because they are verrrry thin. Just went to refill my glass and barely touched the top of the glass and to my immense surprise a huge chunk just broke off! Figured they were low quality but this confirms it haha definitely not worth the money imo
"
K. Shankman,5.0,2021 25 November,"
these wine glasses are just what I was hoping for:  they're beautiful and elegant looking.  They hold a LOT of wine, though, so you need to be careful--what I consider a standard glass of wine (150-200 ml) takes up 1/3 or less of these glasses.
"
NickO,5.0,2021 22 November,"
The glass  is well made and excellent value for money. Not the level of a Zalto, but at 1/6th the price, it is still a very good  hand blow glass. One of the glass I received is 117g compares to Zalto Bordeaux glass of the same volume which is 112g. However, the second glass was obviously made by a less skilled artisan and is thicker weighing 148g. I wrote to JBHO and they responded within a couple of hours with a reasonable explanation and offered to replace the glass. I replied with my address and received information in less than 3 hours that one new set of glasses is being sent to me arriving in two days. I was also advised that there is no need to return the less well made glass. I am truly impressed with their customer service and it is perhaps the best I have experienced over the last 16 years of shopping with Amazon. I would highly recommend not only the great value glass which is beautiful. But also the customer service is simple unparalleled!

The form of these wine glasses are elegant and beautiful.  They both came in perfect condition. Before using I washed them and handled them gently and with care in the washing, rinsing and towel drying process.  If you handle these (and all) wine glasses gently I assure you they will not break.The shape is very attractive and appealing.  I use these everyday with dinner.  Perfect!
"
Hailey,5.0,2021 15 September,"

vegastyphoon,5.0,2022 25 June,"
We filled these puppies with JUSTIN Cabernet which we purchased on Amazon, Unfortunately this Vino is not currently available.Either way, these tall premium wine vessels tend to be very fragile and do tip over easy. We had two bottles of JUSTIN Cab which may explain why these glasses broke. I will be purchasing another set and supervised by someone who'll keep them upright.Overall, these are light beautiful glasses which compliment any Red. Two semi-sober thumbs up !
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2022 24 October,"
I do like these glasses, not in love.  I really thought the diameter of the rim would be larger, like not to put my entire nose in it, but I was expecting it to be larger.  For the price of these two, I am just ok with my purchase but not enough to return, I will keep them on hand.

+or-,5.0,2020 14 August,"
I sent this assortment as a gift and it was very well received.  Because I just learned that some others have received assortments that are not the OREO, CHIPS AHOY! & Nutter Butter Cookie Variety Pack, Family Size, 3 Packs which I ordered, I asked the recipient and have received confirmation that this order was delivered containing the assortment as described.  I personally have not had a Chips Ahoy cookie in many years, but these are the store-bought manufactured cookies that my mother always purchased, so I know them quite well.  Oreos were a favorite of all of my sisters, but I preferred the chips ahoy.  They also liked the icing on cupcakes while I ate the cake.  I ate only the egg yolk and they savored the white of hard-boiled eggs.  I convinced my younger sister to trade her crispy chicken skin for my skinned chicken legs.  I've gotten off track here, sorry.  I sent these cookies as a gift because the recipients love Nutter Butter cookies which I have never tasted.  This assortment was more interesting than sending them a single bag of cookies and since they are a family of five, the cookies will all be enjoyed even if they are in bits and pieces.  They have not yet opened the Chips Ahoy which, according to other reviewers may arrive broken, so I alerted them of that possibility and suggested that they enjoy them in a bowl with milk just as they eat cereal if that's the case with their shipment.  The cookies are well known and top-selling cookies by the Nabisco division of Mondelez International.

Ms Tony T,4.0,2020 13 August,"
Normally I'd prolly be raving about these.  As far as the nutter butter I can they were fantastic. Just about perfect the thing didn't seal shut right no matter what it had a couple spots that just kept coming loose or open a little. So I put them in an airtight bag and they were perfect from there.The Oreos were fairly decent Not stale not expired. Tasted very good, and the package sealed very well Everytime.Unfortunately something was off about the chips ahoy. Not sure if they were expired (my first thought was they didn't get sealed so put them in an airtight bag as well.) Or if it had to do with how they were stored. Or how shipped Just no clue but they were toooo dry with an oddly bitter stale taste that was not in any way good. They weren't horrible but no where near how the should have tasted. Not as fresh as they should have been. Very unimpressed with these.As a note I have purchased these before until this order they were a subscription item for me.. I've gotten them a few times now and this is the first time they have been this bad. Maybe a little stale or dry or..... assumed from shipping conditions rather then something being off or wrong with them.It's was amazing and very dissappointing to experience such a difference from one order to another.Then if you choose to buy it again you have to basically play roulette with whether it's gonna be a good one or one like the last I got. Not a  big fan of hit and miss when it comes to food especially my snack food. Hopefully can find another mix with the nutter butter one of my faves and a couple others I actually like and that show up fresh and delicious. Fingers crossed.

Take 1/2 Cup of water put it in a coffee cup and stick in center of microwave and cook it for 90 seconds 00.90 then open the microwave and then place cookies on microwave safe plate with the 1/2 water full cup in the center of plate and cook for 60 seconds (1 Minute) let cool before touching, eating as contents are hot.

PROS:AMOUNT - over 120 cookies in total.VARIETY - OREOS, CHIPS AHOY AND NUTTER BUTTERS, something for everyone.PRICE - I paid about 13 dollars and I get free Prime delivery, so a good price for me.FRESHNESS - Ones I got were fresh.CON:If there is ONE CON, it's that not as convenient as the snack packs, but there's ALSO more cookies total, so it balances out!

I loved the way that the cookies tasted. The Chips Ahoy Cookies were full of chocolate chips and were soft. They were delicious. The Nutter Butter cookies had peanut butter filling in them and were tasty. My favorite package of cookies were the Oreos, because Oreos are my favorite cookie. They were delicious too. I ate these cookies as a snack, when I went fishing and swimming.

Ren,5.0,2021 24 July,"
Love the variety of the pack and the taste of each. These are some of my favorite brands of snacks and when I saw they were in a bundle I had to get it!
"
Charles Boatwright,5.0,2021 6 August,"
This combo is good for the person who enjoys different flavors and can’t make up their mind or for families who like different things.
"
Ky McDaniel,4.0,2021 14 April,"
Couldn’t wait already opened them
"
Laura “ChronicEverything”,5.0,2020 16 November,"
This is a fantastic mix of well loved cookies and every member of my 6 person family has a favorite. When purchased in this combo package (especially using Subscribe and Save) the price is unbeatable; even cheaper than generic versions. Yummy tummy, happy wallet
"
Angela,5.0,2021 23 June,"
I liked that two out of the three had resealable closing. Wish all three had resealable. It is nice to have to keep the freshness.
"
Mag,5.0,2021 30 January,"
This was a great purchase for a home or office. The flavor of the cookies were amazing and fresh. The packaging was great and the overall value was amazing. Cookies were a great standard size with thickness.
"
Michelle L.,5.0,2021 30 July,"
These were fresh and flavorful! They or packaged well and came in in perfect condition!
"
migs,3.0,2021 21 July,"
All our favorites for a decent price. The only problem is I had to use them mostly as pie crusts or ice cream toppings because there weren’t enough whole pieces to eat as cookies. Lesson learned.
"
C. Benison,4.0,2020 20 June,"
This was a great deal! But the chocolate chip cookies were crushed to bits. The Oreos and nutter butters were fine.I would definitely order again, just not the chocolate chip cookies.
"
David L. Ellis,4.0,2021 23 January,"
Okay, you like these or you do not.  i do.
"
LiliBelle,5.0,2020 10 July,"
Wow! For the price, these 3 family packs of Oreos, Chips Ahoy, and Nutter Butters are a STEAL! I received the correct 3 cookie packs shipped well and with fresh dates! The Nutter Butters went first in our house... so yummy!
"
ShopNShare4Fun,5.0,2020 25 September,"
The Oreos were all broken up in little pieces! Better packaging needed! Since we didn't open them right away it was too late to ask for a replacement . The Nutter Butters were better but some of them were broken as well.

These are 3 of my favorite cookies.  They arrived well packaged and are a good value for the price.  They're a real treat to get when I can't do any shopping myself.
"
Lineman Art,5.0,2020 16 May,"
I got 2 triscuit and 2 all hail 100% whole grain. No cookies of any kind. Never had an order this far off before. Update. After posting my problem I was sent the correct which arrived in two days. Yea, they made a mistake, who hasn’t, but fixed it fast.
"

"
Bonnie M. Hartmann,2.0,2020 14 December,"
When I ordered these for my son at college it didn't give me an expiration date.  Needless to say, the expiration date ended up to be about a month after my purchase and my son wasn't able to eat many of them before the expiration so they ended up in the garbage.  I should have just sent him the money to buy them at the local store by him.  Wasted my money for the most part.  :-(
"
Lise,3.0,2020 30 June,"
Cookies were authentic but not as fresh as they are in grocery store. Oreos rarely are whole. I have purchased these 2  or 3 times since I’m avoiding grocery stores, and I noticed the freshness problem each time.

fina,1.0,2020 22 November,"
What is bad about cookies???? Let me tell you... chips ahoy and oreo’s were both terribly stale... very dry-in a bad way , with little flavor.. as if they had been in a warehouse for years!! Tasted like sawdust. Went in the garbage fast. As for nutter butter, never tasted them before. So I don’t know what they were supposed to taste like. They went into garbage as well- tasted like thick honey-not peanut butter. I hate to complain , but it seems that packaged goods have been very below par!!!

Smurphette,4.0,2020 9 March,"
I don't have to talk about how good cookies are. Or even how good Nabisco cookies are.  Everyone has a favorite. This three pack of FAMILY sized cookies arrived double boxed and with some packing paper as padding. Probably better packed than the grocery store ones!  They are fresh, with the nearest expiration date three months out and one was four months out. Who keeps a pack of cookies that long?Pricewise, I compared the current Amazon price to my local grocery store; and if you aren't buying them on sale at the store, it's the same price as this three pack. If you get a sale price at the store, it's better there.  But if the convenience of having cookies come to your house while you do other things is worth it to you; you want these.
"
IRG,4.0,2020 19 April,"
These arrived soon after we entered stay-in-place here in NYC. To say that they were quickly opened and eaten is to put it mildly. We needed snacks and there they were. Break out the coffee, the milk, the tea.But we did, seriously, pace ourselves in eating them because they were really good and we could easily have disposed of them by nonstop snacking.My favorite, and that of others, is the classic Oreo. How can you not love an oreo, especially the classic one?Chocolate chips, which are softer than many, are another crowd pleaser here.Although we are all fond of peanut butter, can't say that Nutter Butters were as popular as the other two varieties.We don't generally buy a lot of cookies (we're a savory/chips family) but these really hit the spot.
"
D.D,4.0,2020 22 March,"
It's probably a safe bet you have tried at least one of these cookies.  I actually never had nutter butter, and thought it was quite good.  My kids never had it either.  Chips ahoy and Oreos are classics, and taste  like how I remember them as a kid.My son loves Oreos, and you must eat them with milk.  There is no other way.  My daughter is a cookie fan so she enjoyed the chip a hoys, and we all liked the nutter butter for being our first time.  This was a good variety pack, and come in a box with each of these separately.  We like them.
"

Chips Ahoy: I haven’t purchased chocolate chip cookies in years. Since I first baked my own from scratch, I’ve preferred my own soft-baked cookies. I wasn’t expecting to like these at all, but the taste of chocolate lingers on the tongue and makes them delicious.Oreo: These are one of my daughter’s favorites. I prefer the vanilla variety, but it’s hard to beat these cookies when you add them to vanilla ice cream.Nutter Butter: They’re cute and tasty. My husband loves peanut butter so he’s a big fan of these. This was my daughter’s first time trying them and she liked them as well.4 STARS: Be forewarned, cookies are addictive. My family is really enjoying this variety pack.

We never have enough cookies in the house and since this package included three of our favorites this was a must buy. 1 CHIPS AHOY! Original, 1 OREO Original, 1 Nutter ButterI do wish the Oreos had been Double Stuffed :)My only complaint is that the Chips AHOY! did not travel will. When we opened the package there were a lot of broken cookies, but broken did not affect the taste at all.The cookies were enjoyed by our whole family!

Family favorites slightly cheaper than the grocery store delivered to my front door.  What could be better?  This is the ultimate cookie trifecta and is by far the top three cookie choices for our family so it is nice to be able to order all three with one click.  I like that it is the larger family packs.  I use these to put in my kids lunches.  I used to get the prepackaged ones, but felt like 6 was too many and the only ones that have two are the Oreos.  I think three is the perfect number.  My kids like to get one of each kind!  The kids are always excited to find cookies in their lunches.It is a nice convenient way to get cookies.  They arrived without being damaged was my only real concern.  I will be buying these again.

The Oreos and Chips Ahoy are my favorites.  There's a lot of cookies. They are crisp and fresh and yummy.The peanut butter ones are too sweet.  My son isn't too crazy about them either.There is no price listed, but I wouldn't pay more than $3.50 for each extra large pack.  They showed up in a large box with no broken cookies.
"
R. Sutton,4.0,2020 13 March,"
Oreo & Chips Ahoy...... Great!  No issuesNutter Butter:  I still like  get peanut butter.  These cookies are a satisfying way to get my peanut butter but far from real peanut  butter  taste.  The outer cookie is solid, so don't see broken cookies in the package.Only down side, can't re-seal the package.  Once I open this one, I have to find a big zip lock bag.
"
Wired Rabbit,5.0,2020 10 March,"
Who doesn't love Oreos?  And I have to admit, I do enjoy Nutter Butter cookies with milk or coffee.  Chips Ahoy are the classic chocolate chips-filled cookies that are very satisfying.  All three came in a very secure box, well wrapped and not one cookie was even broken a bit. I was amazed.  The size of the packages, a pound or more each, means that for the price, you are getting a whole lot of cookies.  For price comparison, Safeway sale price for Oreo 8 Oz packs is around 2.50.  These packages have a pound or more for a bit over four dollars. So this is a deal. A great way to get a bunch of cookies all will love, for parties and good times!

Who could resist this supreme tasty trio from Nabisco?Headlining the trio is the cookie icon, Oreo; even becoming part of the lingo in describing ideologies in certain circumstances. My favorite of this line-up.Used in ice-cream toppings and a favorite of many since childhood.Next in line, is Nutter Butter, my wife's & son's favorite. A sort of Goldilocks; just right in crunch(not too hard, not too soft; in taste(not too sweet & sugary, not too bland); and the size is just right as well.And then the anchor in the lineup: Chips Ahoy. Unfortunately, these ended up being a little to hard and crumbly. Not was we were used to from this name brand, well known product.All in all, a stellar cookie lineup of all star taste & satisfaction![minus the chips]
"
Natasha Galbreath,4.0,2020 9 March,"
A good value for the cookies we all know and love. Nothing new about them its the same recipe as always. It comes with family sized packages of traditional Oreo, Nutter Butter and original Chips Ahoy. If your family are fans of these products, this wont disappoint!
"
JLES,5.0,2020 19 March,"
What's not to love about this variety pack? Oreos, Chips Ahoy and Nutter Butter cookies are all favorites in this family of younger children and the parents. I think my spouse could sit down an eat an entire package at one time. These were all fresh, delish and in perfect condition with no damage. I can't even bring these home from the grocery without some breaking. My favorite is the Nutter Butters and I olny have to fight the spouse for these as the kids are too busy licking the middle out of the oreos.
"
Annette,5.0,2020 13 March,"
Just like in the store, these cookies look the same and taste the same - yummy and great. This is a really good family value variety pack of cookies with the Chips Ahoy cookies, Nutter Butters and Oreos together. This offers three good different options of cookies for everyone to choose and have variety. It's good having these choices together because some like lots of chocolate, others like less chocolate and others don't like any chocolate - it works great for me and my family's preferences with our differences of what we prefer.If you want some yummy cookies, some variety, and good size cookie packages for you and your family or friends then you'll love these.

This is 3 FAMILY SIZE packages of cookie snacks from Nabisco.  Oreo's, Chips Ahoy's and Nutter Butter's.  The Oreo package is 1 lb 3.1 oz.  The Chips Ahoy are 1 lb 2.2 oz.  The Nutter Butter are 16 oz.  The packages are family size.  All 3 packages had good best buy dates but these cookies will not last that long.  We will have eaten all of them.  We have already opened the Chips Ahoy's and the Oreo's.  Both are delicious.  You can not go wrong buying this 3 pack.  Yummy cookies.

Three delicious cookies in on shipment! If you’ve had these cookies, you know what to expect. Cookies arrived I damaged and fresh.
"
Patricia,5.0,2020 16 March,"
These came while my grown son was visiting, and we pretty much ran through the Oreos that night, and the Chips Ahoy the next day. About half of the Nutter Butters are still in the package- not our favorite, though they are tasty.  I thought the cream filling was skimpy in the Oreos, and even checked the package to see if it was a different version- lower calorie or fat, etc. The Chips Ahoy were very crumbly, but good. These didn't last long enough to be eaten with ice cream, but they are good for that or simply dunking in milk. Simple goodness.

I have children rnaging from K through college. Cookies are an absolute must in this house if I don't want to hear complaining that thie'rs nothing ""sweet to eat in the entire house."" This is a great buy. Three of everyone's favoriate flavors and enough to go around so no one is fighting over who gets to open a package and get first dibs. Definitely a pantry staple and a good value as well.

You absolutely cannot go wrong with this cookie flavor combo.  The box arrived well packaged and all of my cookies were in perfect condition.  The sell by date seemed a little short to me (May 2020) but it could have just been the package that I received.  The cookies were all very fresh and delicious, exactly what I would expect from these brands.  Very pleased!

What a great combo!  Something for everyone in this package deal. My favorite are the Nutter Butters. They are so amazing, and addictive. I don’t know how anyone could say no. The Oreos were amazing. I am not a huge fan of Chips Ahoy, but the husband loves them.  Win, win!!  I do wish the Nutter Butter pack had a reseal package.

I rely heavily on the reviews of other customers and their experiences and sometimes I even go straight to the reviews before I even look at the vendor's description and full listing / photos of their product.  SO...... I was sort of wary purchasing cookies from this vendor because of many reports of stale, smashed cookies, and expired best by dates. But I decided to take a chance.All the cookies were purchased on 10/16/21 and delivered on 10/18/21 PRIME delivery within 2 days THANK YOU very much Amazon.Am glad to say almost everything was fine with my cookies - no crumbs, no breaks with the NUTTER BUTTERS and OREOS, and quality of those cookies were excellent even though the OREOS were within 1 month of their expiration date.EXCEPT for the CHIPS AHOY, they were mostly broken and had a stale funny aftertaste yet they were still 3 months within their expiration date.***NUTTER BUTTER***Expiration date 24 FEB 22NO PROBLEM-NUTTER BUTTERS***OREOS***Expiration date 27 NOV 2021NO PROBLEM-OREOS***CHIPS AHOY***Expiration date 24 JAN 22PROBLEMS- BREAKS, LARGE CRUMS,STALE TASTING, SLIGHTLY STRANGE AFTER TASTE. (See all 6 photos)So the question is are the CHIPS AHOY still edible?  Well, I really don't have a big problem with breaks and crumbs and I never met a cookie I didn't like unless there was green mold and things crawling around. And I even sometimes enjoy stale cookies with a glass of milk. So my real issue is with the funny after taste and I'm hoping after the Chips Ahoy air out some, the aftertaste will dissipate.Would I order these from this vendor again, maybe.... maybe not.

G. M. Martel,4.0,2020 10 December,"
First, I want to say that I am not a professional installer nor do I always DIY things so this was a process for me and I was making a lot of notes along the way.Overall, I love the LEDs, they are bright, with what looks like accurate colors and the multiple modes is awesome.  I find the app control quite responsive, with only 1 complaint.  Once you enter the controller for the LEDs there is no way to turn them on/off.  You have to back out to the connection menu and hit the slider next to the connected controller.  Being able to remotely control the lights is great and limited extraneous wiring needs.Product ArrivalProduct arrived well packaged and on time.  I know it is shipped by Amazon, but it is always nice to get it right when I expect it.  The use of anti static bags for the pieces inside was a nice touch.  I have ordered multiple inexpensive RGB options for the house/car and these were the first ones that had everything in the box bagged up.  Second piece of the packaging was the imagery on the box.  While a little embellished, it was nice to see the box come with some representation of what this would look like on a car.  It is an extra touch that usually is a brown box with no image and a sticker on it.InstallationI appreciate the desire to have everything come out of the box connected, but I am not sure how many people will be able to fully install it without unscrewing the strips from one another and having to mount them separately.  This action in and of itself is not a pain, but once you unscrew them the O-Rings used to prevent water from getting into the connections can come off.  I dropped two in the process of unscrewing and pulling apart the 6 connection points for the system.  They are small and rather difficult to find once dropped.  My daughter and I searched for about 10 minutes to find the two.  If the system came disassembled, meaning none of the strips connected, it may prevent this from happening, plus it enables an easier placement of LED strips and tying off of extra wire.  If I were KORJO I would survey purchasers and ask how many of you disconnected the strips before installation, if 80%+ did, then ship it disconnected.  May seem like a nit-pick, but any little frustration can turn into a big frustration through different chain of events.The 3M tape on the back of the strips do not seem to like being exposed to air too long before adhering to the surface it is going to be attached too.  I learned on the rear strips that by pulling the entirety of the backing off before starting to stick it to the surface I wanted it on, and it fell off.  3M VHB tape is an extremely good tape and the surface was plastic which I have used the tape on before and it was clean.  I am making an assumption on why it wouldn't adhere.  The VHB tape could be thicker a bit.  I know this makes it harder to hide under the sides and front of the car, but at the same time it allows for more little scratches or changes in the surface of placement.  I noticed that in sticking on the long strips on the sides of the car, the extra length has a tendency to pull on the already stuck portion as you are working your way down the strip as well.  Just something to keep in mind.The little plastic anchors are clear which allows the light through, but that allows means they glow as the light passes through them.  On my front strips you cannot see the strips but you can definitely notice the anchors.  I am not sure there is a fix for this, just make sure that when using the anchors you get them out or site as well.Waterproof AbilitiesThis system has now been through 5 car washes and a total of 82 miles of driving when it is raining.  I have not had a single failure yet. (Knock on wood)  They seem to be holding up well.  I will admit that the seals with some extra hot glue in them are a little concerning when you first look at them but they have been holding up well.  As I live in Chicago, I look forward to what happens as snow starts falling and how they will deal with the temperatures.  I also detail the car with a steam cleaner in the garage with high pressure steam making its way over these strips as I clean the different areas of the car and still no moisture intrusion.  I have been actively watching this based on other reviews.  I will update if something happens.Lighting PerformanceThey are definitely brighter than I thought, I can run them in the afternoon as the sun starts going down and see them quite clearly in daylight.  They look amazing at night and the different modes are really key to this.  Using one of the red, white, and green ones right now for the holiday season.  I wish there was a way to create customer motion modes, but I cannot find it in the app at this point.  I realize that is more of an app issue, but keep in mind that the entire experience of this product is from purchase through use to support, so this is important.  Other than that the system is responsive and easy to connect to, the searching for BT devices in the app is a bit awkward as it finds my tv, my watch, and a whole bunch of other non-LED things that I need to scroll through to get to the controller, but it is a minor issue as well.I love the LEDs, they look good, they perform, and so far are much better than I expected.
"
Chris E.,4.0,2022 20 October,"
Customer Service took care of me. They sent me another strip and it actually works this time. I'm skeptical but can't complain except for the lost time on the original install. They at least made it right and the lights do look really good. Only complaint now is the the app is a little funky but once you figure it out it seems to be reliable. Thanks for the customer service.Original - I bought this kit, installed it, honestly looks great. Then thought, huh, why is the back not changing colors. Literally half the lights are unresponsive to color change in the app. They stay white all the time. So disappointed I spent all that time on a clean install and now I have to rip it all out to return it. DONT BUY UNLESS YOU LIKE REDOING YOUR WORK.
"
Actanonverba,5.0,2022 16 October,"
Ok. So I'm like most of the people that did a review. I bought two sets of lights one for my truck and one for my wife's jeep. Well with work and all I tested both sets of lights they both came on didn't think to check the functionality of them to excited to do so. So one weekend I put hers in not to bad on setup for Jeep Grand Cherokee loved the ways hers looked. So I waited till the following week to put it on my truck got them all situated and we'll wouldn't you know it one side of my trucks didn't work I emailed the Korjo team told them what happened within 4-5 days I had a new set they sent out and now it's all good.

Update as of 10/18/2022**I got a message from the seller and was helped by Emma. She was amazing! She helped resolve my issue and was very kind and helpful, I really was not expecting this today and she really made my day. I would recommend this seller for this product because they stand by the product and will help you get the issue resolved quick and easy!5 stars! -Danny MolinaThe first couple of weeks with this I was so impressed. But after a few weeks the lights would start to dim little by little until it’s barely even visible at night. Maybe I got a defective product but for the amount paid I would’ve hoped this lasted at least a year.
"
Gerrad,4.0,2022 14 October,"
So I ordered a kit and sadly one of the led strips did not work, I reached out to the seller who sent me a new one however it never arrived Emma then sent me another strip which arrived and is working great! Highly recommend! The adhesive is not the best it will stick but for someone like me who gets snow I’m sure it won’t last long so I decided to grab some gorilla glue and place little dabs along the strip for extra strength. They are decent for brightness I’ll definitely be getting more soon for my buddy’s
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 16 October,"
I installed the kit and it worked great. Was bright and nice but after a week one side stopped working. I bought 2 sets for 2 cars so going to replace the current one with that one and return the one I have on. But before I sent it out I was contacted by the seller. Emma was very nice and was sending me a replacement strip instead. That was great because it took me a good while to set up the lights. And did not want to have to take it all down for one strip. Lights are very bright compared to others I have tried. Thanks Emma
"
Djlythium,4.0,2022 13 January,"
This is a pretty quality kit, though it has some quicks that seems like somewhat important oversights.- First, the Bluetooth module is only about 2’ from one of the pairs of 24” lights, which makes mounting it in a position away from heat/moisture pretty difficult, whether it’s mounted in the front of the vehicle or the rear. Simply, not having enough cable length to mount the module anywhere inside the cabin (or even around the engine bay) puts the module at risk of heat / moisture damage. Hopefully, those modules are weatherproof (they seem like it, but we’ll see).- Second, the included brackets and screws seem chosen for the kit almost haphazardly. The tiny screws work *only for screwing into plastic*; they will snap during any attempt to screw into metal. The brackets themselves had a small, but important, IMO, issue that no one has seemed to mention: the brackets only fully secure the LED strips at the ends of the strips themselves. I'll try to explain: the depth of the brackets is about 3/8"", which matched the thickness of the ends of the strips (where the power wires connect), but is too large for the rest of the strip, which is only about 1/4"" thick. So, when using the brackets across the LED strip range, there was about a 1/8"" gap between the bracket and the strip, which means that the bracket isn't really securing the strip, but rather acting as a sort of 'safety' to prevent the strip from falling completely off the vehicle should the adhesive fail. IMO, this is a huge oversight, and one I was not about the let linger. My fix was to use a small piece of that clear VHB tape I used for the front strips here, trifolded to fit into the space within the brackets. Then, because of how I mounted the LED strips down the sides, and in the rear, I snipped off one end to make them C-mount brackets. After mounting them with tiny self-tapping screws into metal, they worked out well! The tape eliminated the 1/8"" gap, and everything mounted solidly.- Third, the app is great, for the most part, but a small gripe I have if that you have to reconnect it to the lights after every power cycle. The Bluetooth loses connection, which makes sense, though it’d be nice if it tried to automatically reconnect whenever the app was opened. Just a suggestion.- Lastly, and this goes for any kind of adhesive prep, *ensure you thoroughly clean the mounting surface!* I used a towel soaked with rubbing alcohol & windex (to dilute) to clean all surfaces, twice, to ensure bonding, and it seemed to work thus far. I think the LED strips are backed with 3M VHB tape, which works well when bonding to a surface free from all dirt, grease, and grime. Take time to prep the surface well, and you should be GtG. I’ll try to report back with long-term updates of the adhesion.Now, despite my findings / concerns, I’m very happy with the setup! I looked for a legit kit for a looooong time, and this one, overall, is fantastic! The light response is instant, there are many colors, the lights are bright even in the daytime, and there are a TON of patterns!

"
Brandon,5.0,2022 13 October,"
The lights are bright, and they look amazing. I had an issue with one of my sides, and it was replaced by support. I didn't trust the adhesion so I used the hangers. When pulling the broken side off though the adhesive was strong enough to hold on and rip the already broken strips. The app works well though I wish it would auto connect. I also wish that it was a bit more friendly as for things like favorite patterns etc.

alejandro ramirez,5.0,2022 27 October,"
I have had these lights for about 5 months now they look good on my car and I love them.I ran into one issue with the strip but the sellers were very helpful and took care of me so don’t be afraid to try them out.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 26 September,"
Love the way the lights look and the ease of the app via my phone. Since in my town flashing underglow is considered illegal I usually just ride with the solid non emergency color and up to this point its been a non-issue with law inforcement. I did how ever have 2 lights go completely solid white and would not react with the app and would stay on even after power was turned off, a quick email to customer service who responded really fast and they sent me a replacement set of neons that arrived the next day. If your on the fence about buying trust me you will love the way your car looks.
"
Kenneth smith,5.0,2022 28 October,"
Love the lights, but it kills my battery everyday, going to try to put it on a switch to cut off power, still tho, never had any led lights drain my battery that fast before. But do enjoy the lights
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2022 14 October,"
These lights exceeded expectations.  They are very bright and work flawlessly.  They arrived with a faulty Bluetooth controller but Emma (customer service) sent a new one that arrived 2 days later.  They work great for a budget underglow kit.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 Pros: Adhesive works really well, but make sure to use the brackets to be on the safe side.Install is not bad at all, from an electrical standpoint make sure you do not just wire the lights directly to the battery, either use the supplied connector or wire it using a rocker switch with an inline fuse.Overall it looks really good for the price... it doesn't look as good as lowglow but for the price I am very happy with it.Cons: I did have an issue with one of my strips after installing it. It would only remain white and would not change colors. It also would not turn off with the app, but luckily since I wired it with a rocker switch I was still able to turn it off.I contacted customer service (swomall@foxmail.com, not the email that comes on the box) and they were super helpful and provided me with a replacement strip within a few days. the only down side was having to uninstall the faulty strip and install the new strip.

Thomas ,3.0,2022 12 July,"
Cool looks, drains battery if you plug into something always on like a horn. Plug into something that requires the car to turn on like the fog lights. Sucks u cant turn on from outside w/o vehicle on but will save you some time from jump starting the car. I plugged mine into the horn cause my fog light was already in use by the inter glow lights. Which could also be why car died. Who knows. I did have to get a replacement. While installing some turned them on to make sure i had lights positioned correctly. Only front half worked cause in the led where u cut it, it separated without cutting through the waterproofing cover which was a bummer. The only other thing is there are two strips which u have to route starting with power source and pull everything through a path that doesnt go near moving parts. Would like to see a model with disconnect locations in the wiring so if i need to replace one i can. Since i only pulled out the bad strip I technically used lights from two different sets and there was a length difference and a slight color differ When compared next to each other though i ordered the exact replacement so dont cross kit if ones messed up and test before u find your routing path as well. App isnt too bad. It communicates with the lights well unlike my inter glow which is different company from 2017. Lots of preselected modes. U cant customize the flashes but its got a bunch and just increase til u see a pattern u like. U can pick and choose solid colors and save presets which is nice. Not bad. Would consider this to b a mid quality product simply because my brand new battery that was replaced 3 months ago died a week after install. Instructions do say for fog light but rebel life. This leads me to believe that that bluetooth control box takes up ridiculous amounts of power but like i said i have two set ups that are technically always on so i cant say for sure. Who knows maybe i got a short elsewhere, i did have to replace it but thats normal for a 5 yr old battery. Excluding battery issues for the price its totally worth it and gives your car that extra umpf in appearance it was missing. I enjoy and run them every time i drive at night and have no reason for them in the day which is why i was surprised my car was dead. Cant say for sure it was the lights that killed it. Aside from battery 4 stars

This kit was about a 4hr install by myself on my truck. The screws and plastic brackets were very cheap and break easy. I had to drill holes before I put the screws in because the screw heads just twist right off (cheap) running all the wiring is time consuming. The 2 sided tape would not stick to anything (cheap) once I got done I was very impressed with how bright they are and all the different modes. The Bluetooth app was pretty straight forward. For the price I would recommend.

Ozzy,4.0,2022 24 July,"
Pros: This underglow is seriously great! I had Govee lights before these and I thought they were good but they weren’t waterproof so they kept dying. These, however, have withstood the Florida summer thus far and I am very impressed. It’s nice and vibrant, the adhesive is good, not great, and it seems really reliable.Cons: The app feels like it’s absolute bare minimum effort. It’s annoying having to “reconnect” manually every time, and going through 120 tick marks is a little time consuming needless to say. The app needs a lot of work but it’s sad to say they’ll probably leave it that way. If you don’t mind the inconvenience of bad user interface, then no big deal.All in all, real solid product!

So this kit is crazy bright! For the price it is very bright.  Only down side is the app to work it doesn't have a off feature. You have to slide the brightness setting all the way to the left. There isn't an actual ""off"" feature.  Besides that everything is great.

Amazon Customer,3.0,2022 7 October,"
So the light install itself was fine. Was a bit of a pain to get the cables to my battery/fuse box, but that’s due to the shape of everything going on in my engine bay.I chose to add a fuse into my fog light switch, and ran the negative to the battery. (The way it recommends in the instructions.) Three days later my car was dead, and I had to have my husband give me a jump so I could get to work.I suppose I could have gone the route of using the 12v, but I really didn’t wanna have to mess my going through my firewall. It also would have looked messy imo.The app works fine for me, the lights themselves also worked just fine for me. Just wish I didn’t have to pop my hood and plug them in before I used them/ remember to unplug them every time. Overall, you get what you pay for. I’ll upgrade eventually. 🤷🏼‍♀️

Chamber,5.0,2022 16 August,"
im a night person, soon as it gets dark i hop in my car ill be out all night. now that i installed these underbody lights i never wanna go home. i usually use the green color to match the color of my car but when i wanna really show off ill use the multi colors. easy to install, i bought these a few months ago so im doing a later review. the switch to turn the lights on went bad after a few months so i suggest you go to auto zone or advanced auto and buy a strong toggle switch. and the app is easy to use took me a few tries to figure it out but in the end it works perfect.

Se instalan muy facil el brillo es muy bueno doy 4 estrellas al preoducto pq me uviese gustado que las barras led delanteras y traseras fueran un poco mas largas y que los cables tuvieran los mismos conectores que trae en las leds delanteras asi seria mas facil para instalarlas ya que no a todo el mundo le gusta pasar los cables por debajo del carro en mi caso yo los paso por encima de los inerfenders para esconderlos lo mas pocible y tener que pasar las barras de led por hay no es muy agradable solo para poder esconder el cable como deseo

Isaiah zeek,4.0,2022 12 June,"
So far these are good, I've ordered these a lot. They were so much better when every light was individual now it's all one piece and if one strip falls off somewhere when your out and about you cant take it off or do anything, it'll just get destroyed and then have to buy  WHOLE new set. However everything is good, just the box came damaged with like a knuckle like indention. I hooked the lights up and one half side of 2 strips continues to stay on even when turned off and will not change colors but the rest of can will change.Sending these back for a refund and get another pair. We will see how it goes

 So, I bought this little KORJO kit on a whim. It was on sale and I wanted to do something fancy cosmetic to my Toyota MR2 Spyder. The installation was quite easy. The adhesive was just strong enough to hold the strips in place long enough to set some self tapping screws into the body of the car. I am glad that the kit came with hardware (in theory) but you are much better off going to the hardware store and buying your own self tapping screws. I was very impressed by the brightness and vividness of the colors that the LED produced. Compared to some other generic kits I've used in the past, the KORJO is plenty bright for the cost. The major downside is that there is no way to customize the settings more than just editing a solid color to bookmark. That said though the 100+ tracking options get the job done for a simple kit. I was more concerned about how good they would be illuminating my engine bay, which is the primary reason I wanted LEDs in the first place. They do wonders in that regard. Because they are in the hottest part of the car, I have no idea what the longevity of the Korjo's will be. But until they fail I'd say I am a happy customer.

 This product was really great. I love everything about the setting and what you are able to do with them off of the app. I had bought the lights in July and was not able to install them until probably around October or so. One of the strips went out on my driver side around the end of March 2022 which took the current from the front all the way to the back and cut it completely. I was so worried I was going to have to scrap the whole thing and get a new set but after reaching out to the seller, they agreed to send me a replacement set which worked just as great. I get nothing but complements on the lights as I have a strong friend group and even strangers will complement them. They are super bright and I cannot be missed going down the road. The adhesion does stick really well, especially if you clean it with alcohol very thoroughly to ensure you get a nice clean surface. There are a few reviews on here that talk about adhesion being crap, which could had been true but nothing a little bit of extra 3m that won't do the trick to fix it. the original adhesion has stuck in the entirety of it being on in all weather conditions, snow, rain, road salt, and now facing heat. Overall I would recommend this product, and for the price, you really cannot beat it.

 I’ve bought multiple sets of these and have no complaintsCheaper than man options out there and better qualityDoes NOT connect to music on light up but have over 100 settingsIf you have any fall off and get ruined it’s still a lot cheaper to buy a new kit than a “low glow kit “ for 300$ +

S. Thompson,5.0,2022 24 June,"
I bought this kit for my son in August 2021. Unfortunately it sat in a box until May 2022 because we didn’t know how to install it. But he finally got some help from a friend who had tools and knew a bit about installing underglow. The lights looked great except for the left side, and the left back. For some reason they didn’t work at all. Fortunately we had the box and paperwork and emailed the customer service email as advised. Honestly I didn’t expect much since it had been almost a year, but I quickly heard back from Emma who very kindly offered to send us a replacement for the faulty lights. She said the color might not match exactly, but they looks great! My son is thrilled! We would definitely buy these again! I really appreciate the good communication and excellent customer service.

 I would give these 5 stars if the controls and cords would have been better. The installation was fairly easy. I installed these on my Tracker 195 TXW boat. I used the 1st short strip on each side inside the long forward compartments then continued down the inner railing towards the back of the boat. The biggest problem was the length of cable from controller to the connection. I had to buy an extension from another brand that fits but not very well. The cable could not be screwed together to be sealed. I tried looking for extensions made by same manufacturer and could not find them. So ended up spending an additional 20 dollars on top of this purchase. The other brand plugged in but I cannot screw the collar together to secure the connection. I am using heat shrink around it to keep it plugged in. I'm not sure how the adhesive is going to hold up. I cleaned and prepped all surfaces with alcohol before adhesion but still had to add a dab of superglue to one that would not stick and the adhesive was already coming off led strip.Controls are little awkward for this price range. I would expect a stand alone controller not an app. You will need to either wire them to a switched circuit or add a switch to turn these off when desired. The app then allows you to change colors or patterns.Overall up to this point I am happy with the outcome but these leave a little to be desired at this price range. Longer cables needed between controller and first strip, better control or switch should be included. Wish I had spent just a little more time searching and found a kit with all of these options.

Ordered these lights for my wife’s car. They arrived quickly and we’re very easy to install. We did have a minor problem with one of the strips which was corrected quickly with a quick message to the seller. They sent a replacement strip right away and it worked great. This is our second set of lights that we purchased from the seller and both times it has been a wonderful experience.Thanks again and I’m sure we’ll purchase more from you

 These lights are really bright, honestly way brighter than cheap AutoZone/Walmart lights etc. My main reason for purchase was the size,the majority of other underglows are always 48"" (4ft) for the rocker panels (side skirts) which I HATE,it makes the lights look cheap and unprofessional bc most rockers are closer to 6ft ish,plus it has two front and two back strips that are so long I had to overlap them in the back (which is a good thing to me) the front and back strips (mind you two each) are longer than most side strips in other kits. Huge plus++They come with all the hardware you need,brackets,screws,great adhesive (3M),zip ties and most importantly...screw in plugs to connect/disconnect the wires to make installation easier...and they are high quality connectors...not some cheap plug in that will fall out.They were easy enough to install,and are very very bright in comparison to other lights I've seen and delt with,they hang with the best of them I promise.The control is simple,the functions and app all work great but I wish it was sound activated,but for me everything has been seemless functionality wise...just wish it had a bit more options,it has alot...trust me but I like alot...more lol*****The app (for reference to people who want to know what they are buying before hand) is ""LED Hue"",and it uses Bluetooth but you must have your location on to connect,alot of people have this issue so I figured I'd help a bit. & Furthermore,I stay connected to my stereo while I use the lights through Bluetooth to both the stereo and light system without issue,so you don't have to disconnect one to use the other thankfully*****Pro's-Bright (like...really bright)-Easy to install-Easy to connect & control (big win for me personally over most light kits)-High Quality housing/ wires/ adhesive/ controller/ connectors.-Beautiful effectsCan't find any cons personally,it was all pretty straight forward.Note.I only wish my camera could catch the dynamics of the color transitions and brightness/saturation of the lights.Look no further for quality underglows/L.E.D. lights

Honda Fit,4.0,2021 18 June,"
As another reviewer mentioned this light kit used to come in multiple strips that you would link together.This way if you had the lights attached to your bumper and a mechanic needed to take your bumper off they could quickly and simply dissconect the plugs on the front strip.Now these LED strips seem to come in one long strand. I do not like this. No I'm going to have to remove the light strip off of the bumper, let it dangle while i work on my car and then reattach it.What if i damage a strip? It would be so easy to dissconnect one and replace it. Not this, your going to have undo your whole project when it dies.As a computer science graduate I feel the app is really lacking.Besides having a scroll wheel to scroll through the 200 lighting options. How about a tab, SOLID COLOR, Twinkle, PULSE etc.  After that is choosen you should then have the 2nd option to select what colors you want to PULSE or chase each other. Not just a single color or the random colors that they have programmed.I'm currently on a road trip and will post photos and videos at 10,000 miles.The filter should be dry, or just slightly damp before re-installing.The sticky backing is nice to help layout the lights while installing, but I wouldn't rely on it to keep the lights up.

Let me first start off by saying I only write reviews if I REALLY like or dislike something. I have written 5 reviews in my 34 years of life. The product itself is a great idea, and would be amazing if it functioned. The right side works, but on the left side only the front strip works partially, then the side and rear left don't work at all. I have attached a picture of the left front strip where it becomes dysfunctional. The golden part on the left side of the strip works correctly, then the red part only emits either red or no color, then after that no color. I contact the seller not once, or even twice, but THREE times with no response back. I also tried to look up a contact number, email, or ANYTHING; but there isn't any. I was hoping that they could either troubleshoot me or send me a replacement. My only choice at this point is to have them uninstalled and return them. If the seller ends up contacting me by some miracle, I will update you guys.UPDATE: I want to update everyone. The seller DID respond to me in a timely manner, the emails were just going to a different email than I was checking. This was totally my fault! So I did have a little trouble with the lights, but the seller has been so amazing and is sending me a replacement! I get it, there are going to be problems with products occasionally, but how a seller handles those issues says EVERYTHING! I am going to change my rating, because honestly the product is amazing, and the customer service just hit 5-stars as well. Thank you Swomall :)

Ben,5.0,2021 25 November,"
Bought my lights in July of 2021 they worked up until recently due to a controller malfunction. TO BE NOTED this was due to heavy HEAVY use, by heavy use I mean 2-3 hours a day for weeks at a time. I reached out to their customer service thinking this was going to be another one of those red herrings where nothing would get done.Boy was I wrongI contacted the customer service, Emma (Their customer service rep) responded within 24 hours jumping straight into troubleshooting. After all the troubleshooting was completed (Unfortunately not solving the issue), they finished by offering to send me a brand-new set of lights to replace my old set! Better yet, I did not even have to go through the hassle of sending the old ones back! Overall wonderful experience, Emma was cordial, polite, respectful, and timely in every response.For those saying the lights drain your battery, that’s user error. These are not meant to be hardwired directly to the battery, they are meant to be on some sort of switch that directly shuts power off to the lights. PROS• Sick Lights• 3M Adhesive Tape Mounting• Rubber Screw-on Bracket Mounting• 12v Cigarette Lighter Adapter• Very Long Wiring Harness• Screw In Watertight connections• Great Customer Service• 6 Month Warranty• Very Long LED StripsCONS• Screw-on brackets can be yanked off screws

Amazon Customer,3.0,2021 13 October,"
The kit worked great before install. Ran power using the lighter switch. Checked lights again after all that wire was hidden, worked great, surprisingly because the power wires are 22 gauge or smaller. Completely installed the kit, turned it on, and it worked...for 30 secs. Now it only flicker when the power cord going into each set of lights is moved or messed with, indicating a short. Grabbed a meter to check power coming out of the control box/Bluetooth transmitter, yep, good power and my phone connects to the device. Definitely a short in the first power cords at the beginning of each 3 strand side, which makes the whole thing not work. I knew it was gonna be 50/50 after i saw how small the power wires were.Edit:Amazon sent a new kit, installed being even more careful than before. Its been one week, so far so good. I'm using the outlet switch currently until i find a switch i like or wire straight to fog light fuse. Bumped review up to 3 stars because although it looks and performs good, the wires on both sets are very small gauge and brittle (you'll see when you strip the 1/32"", also, really, soldered exposed wire away for a better connection) , the little rubber hangers are absolutely junk (go buy real wire clamps), and the app isnt the best. The app isnt a big deal because I just leave it on a solid color and change it very rarely. I also dont have that heart feature in my app to save favorite color mixes. It is nice the connectors for the lights are well built and seal with a O ring. 3m tape is as expected. Clean the surface with isopropyl and it should stick for a long time. Remember to mock it up, then remove tape backer. Once its pulled off after pressed on, it might stick again but not with the same bond.

If you are looking for An Underglow Kit to install on Your Vehicle look no further. I have installed this exact kit on 50+ Jeeps over the past year and have NEVER had an Issue with Any part of it. For that Reason I continue to Click ""Buy Again"" 😂😂😂The Bluetooth App works Flawlessly and Easy to Connect. Once Connected to the App you can Switch the lights On or Off, Change Colors, Create Your Own Color or Choose Between 120 Different Chase Patterns. What Else do you Want! Lol.The Double Sided tape on the LED Strips Is Strong! Be sure to clean all Surfaces before Sticking the lights to the vehicle.  91% ( Alcohol) works Perfectly. Not sure what else to say but I love a Product that works and is Extremely Reliable. Hope this Review Helps!

Looked great.  The app took a little getting used to.  Install was easy enough with the sticky tape and the mount brackets.  Although the tiny screws that came with the kit took a little coaxing to drive into automotive plastic.  Largest drawback, it stopped working after four months.  I know the device is getting power because the Bluetooth still responds.  Just can't get the lights to come on.Edit: I'm in communication with the company and they're helping resolve the issue by sending a new controller.  I will edit again if it gets fixed.Edit: Company sent me a new controller free of charge. Installed today and works great again. The faulty part was a 5 min fix.  So glad I didn't have to replace it all.

 I have had these installed now for 2 months which I know isn't a long term review. With that being said, I have been on multiple road trips from SC to PA and SC to FL. I have driven in rain with them more times than I can count, and have used automatic carwashes several times. I have had zero issues so far with any of the strips malfunctioning. The app is decent and shows what solid color you are using. It does not tell you which one of the patterns you are using though, which would be a very helpful feature to have. I actually never turn them off because I normally forget and they shut off when I shut the car off anyway. So that means they are on every time I drive the car day or night and still work perfectly.  I have received tons of compliments. Very solid product.
"
Denzel J Poole,4.0,2021 16 July,"
Kit is pretty good.Pros: very bright, app works well, diffrent options out of the box for a hard wire install or a cigarette lighter plug in, app is a on and off switch or you can plug it in the cigarette lighter and use the on and off switch there, lots of diffrent modes, color slider for unlimited color choices, wires were very long and reached every side of my srt4 no problem, double sided tape sticks pretty good.Cons. After less than a week the tape isn't sticking at the corners of 2 of the lights but that could be install error on my part or due to living in florida where the weather is bipolar (hot 1 min then a category 4 hurricane a hour late) , and the white mode isn't white. It's a mix of colors to make white which it's more of a white/ purple color.Conclusion. For the price they work well I am surprised by the kit for the money. If you want a kit with a all white mode, this isn't going to give you all white.

 Kit is comparable to some of the much higher priced kits. Very bright sticks well if you clean area and use alcohol. The brackets they come with are good quality and help hold it on in case the sticky fails. One side note you can use the app to turn it on an off however you have to install it with a manual power switch if its not tied to ignition because the Bluetooth will kill your battery even powered off in the app.

This is a great product compared to most that's out there on the market. No matter how you wire it, even if you follow instructions and look up different YouTube videos, a kill switch is a must! Rout it to the inside of your vehicle to the side panels and get a touch switch.I rewired this 3 different times before getting a switch. All the other ways drained my battery within 4 days and I had to jump it each time.

 The good :The LED seem bright and good quality the wires are nice and thick the LEDs are in nice waterproof shrouds. Lots of different LED features.The bad and some install TIPS, The brackets they give you are good but the screws they give you are absolutely useless, make sure you get yourself some small short self tapping screws and a screwgun. You want to mount these things high enough where people aren't going to see the LEDs themselves just the glow from them. The adhesive isn't that great either do not trust just the adhesive make sure you use the brackets. The app for your phone seems good and the LEDs have many features. Make sure you install the lights to the body and not on any moving or flexing suspension parts. Keep in mind things that are going to or may heat up and try to run the wires away from them, exhaust Etc

 Got these for my truck upon word of mouth recommendation. Had a friend install them and it took them no time at all to hide them underneath and get it going. Also a huge hit with the kids. I'll definitely be putting these on my other vehicles as well.

If you're looking for bright lights, get these!!Very happy with my purchase. Super easy to install. They worked great for 2 months and the controller ended up being faulty. However, the customer service sent me a replacement controller under warranty very fast! Its now working great again! Couldn't be happier!! Highly recommend Korjo Underglow.

 1. Very bright and cool! Lots of compliments and the app is relatively easy to use and connect.2. VERY difficult to install on a Camaro. I don’t know how other cars are built, but Camaro’s don’t seem to have a lot of room underneath to put the lights, which is why you can see the LEDs. Easy fix, just gotta buy something to cover the sides of the strips.3. Good idea to get professional help when installing on a Camaro.4. We did have to drill into the fuse box to get the wire to stay in there without crushing it.5. One back strip ended up not working once we installed it but the customer service was great, they sent us a new one, so really no complaint there.6. Overall, after dealing with the installation of this, I am very happy. I get lots of compliments and it’s easy to play with on the app. Looks fantastic! Great price, too. I would just recommend having a professional put it in if you don’t know much about cars or have the patience.

 What I love about this is that it is Bluetooth controlled from their app. I have these lights powered to a constant fuse in the engine and I can turn them on and off with the app. Amazon will only allow me one video per review, so I hope you enjoy the one that I have attached here. I have also included some photos that display a few different colors. There are a ton of different options on the app and I cannot include them all here. They are super bright and the speed/brightness  can be controlled via the app as well. In the video, I have the speed turned up all the way so that you could see as many differences as possible. These led strips are also incorporated with 3M self adhesive tape. Top of the line!! There isn’t another set of led lights as nice as these out there!  Don’t hesitate to spend a little more money to get the nicest set of lights on the market. Very easy to install. Just start at the front of your vehicle. Do one side front, side, and rear and then do the opposite side front, side, and rear. My controller is installed in the front and it splits off into two leads. They do not daisy chain around the vehicle in a circle. It’s pretty self explanatory and easy to do. No big deal :)I love them! Thanks guys!!!!

John Kamber,4.0,2021 15 January,"
Ordered these lights and had them installed 7 months ago, recently i saw a few of the LEDS on a strip go from static blue (the only color i had the under glow on) after a few more days it turned into more LEDS and eventually the entire right side of my car. If i change the color it was just flicker every color imaginable while the left side of my car goes to whatever color i change it to. Thankfully i installed a switch because these do drain your battery even while off and you will need jumps if you don't. when the lights are off the strips that are bugging out stay on and flicker white rapidly. the only color that it will not bug out from is you guessed it WHITE. paid for this kit because it was recommended to me but i see people on here having the same exact issue. Customer service was amazing and fast at replacing what they believe to be the parts having issues. 10/10 service

"
carolina,3.0,2021 9 May,"
The kit is decent except for a few problems.1. The bluetooth control unit is very close to where the first led strip is going to go in front of the car so you need to keep it inside the front bumper instead of mounted in the engine bay or even in the interior2. The adhesive tape is really not all that adhesive even after scrubbing with soap and cleaning the area with 91% rubbing alcohol until the surface is cleaner than a dining plate.3. there’s no support from this company that i could find. no contact. so when one of my strips broke, i’m making this review in hopes they will reach out to me so i can just buy a replacement strip instead of purchasing an entire new kit.4. the colors you pick on the app aren’t the same as the color that the LEDs light up. I’m not just saying the color is slightly off. It’s an entirely different color (for example choosing green on the app makes the lights purple) so you have to remember what colors actually result in what on the lights.pro tip: If your car is low, definitely use some rubber scrape guards under the front bumper so your strip doesn’t get torn off like mine.KORJO, if you see this review please reach out to me as i cannot find a point of contact either here or running a search.

Dana Boudreau,5.0,2020 18 July,"
The lights provide a great addition to your car for festive events such as parades and shows. Details like anti-static bags and quality 3M adhesive tape give a hint that this is a quality product. Zip ties and mounting brackets provide redundancy that is prudent for stuff attached under a car. Remember to clean any surfaces to help the adhesive do its job. The light spread works nicely, with good coverage under the car and a nice fade outward. The app control with bluetooth is very helpful and makes it easy to adjust patterns, tempo, and brightness on the fly. Using an app is also great since it allows future upgrades like new patterns (hint hint).  Everything you need is included, just leave enough time (and daylight, and dry weather) since you'll need to remove and replace some wheel well splash guards and do a little wiring under the hood. There's a youtube video showing the whole process. Also, if you have a 12volt supply (spare battery, jumper pack) I recommend hooking everything up ""on the bench"" first to make sure everything works as expected. An inline fuse is a good idea to isolate the light system from the fuse box if anything goes wrong. If you like undercar effects this kit is well worth considering. The seller is very responsive and professional, so rest assured that if any issues arise they will be resolved quickly.

Relik_,4.0,2021 5 July,"
Update: after much trouble shooting the voltage with the supplied cigarette lighter adapter was too low to boot up the Bluetooth module. I put it on a separate 6panel fuse block and it powered up. I dismantled the switch and used it as on on off and re wired it so the lights aren’t on all the time. I did go back and retest my original module and it was bad.Well built-installation was ok took a lot of time to properly install very clean and when it worked it was good for about 15 minutes then shut off and would not turn on again even though the app showed it connected I contacted customer support they promptly sent out a replacement but the replacement was also bad cannot get it to connect to the app.
"
connor,4.0,2020 6 September,"
The product was very well put together. The adhesive did not stick as well as I had hoped, but the plastic parts were more than enough to hold it (although i would have liked a few more). However, the product is advertised as waterproof, and it very mush is not. I had the product for less than a week now, and it started raining while I was out. I started to drive home, and when I stepped out of my car the right and back strips were flashing. I pulled my car into my garage and unplugged it from the fuse box, jacked up my car, only to find water had gotten all inside the led strip at the base of the connector. My lights will now not turn on, and Im unsure what to do. It was not a user error, but the reason i did not leave a 1 star was because I believe it was just an error with the product I received specifically. If possible I would appreciate if my product was replaced.

David Huezo,5.0,2022 3 June,"
They look very nice, unfortunately the left side did give me some issues but i reached out to support and Emma helped me get a replacement very quickly, even arrived in 2 days. and I've had the right side for about 5 months now and it still works great.

Garet Bishop,5.0,2022 31 January,"
Love the lights looks amazing on the car but I have bought them too many times. First pair the adhesion comes off the front right. Second time water got in them some how. Third time was my fault and scrapped them off but the fourth time it was the Bluetooth, it will not show up spe110e as the factory bt name of the lights and not I can’t get the name to pull up or to even connect to my phone. I think it’s the Bluetooth box. I have had each set for about 3 months each time. Every time I drive with them on everyone takes pictures and complements on them!
"
Yasmine C.,5.0,2022 7 May,"
I was able to install them with minor issues, though the adhesive is not as strong so I purchased string tape from Lowe’s which did the trick just fine. I did have minor issues with the controller box, which I brought to customer service’s attention and they were super helpful and offered great customer service. I would recommend these to anyone considering them!
"
Lindz,5.0,2022 4 June,"
My husband bought these recently with about average expectations for the money. Similar products that are priced higher don’t always mean better and these lights prove that. These have exceeded his expectations and he couldn’t be happier with the purchase! Would definitely buy again!

Kathleen O. Johnson,5.0,2021 10 June,"
These look great my gen 4 maxima. Spent about 5 hours installing them myself. If I had to do it again (which I may judging by some reviews) I could do it in 3 hours.Using brackets after the adhesive is a must. Your adhesive will fail at the ends eventually due to gravity so be sure to add support there and ever 16 inches or so. As for the provided silicone brackets, I'm sceptical though I did use them along with the provided short screws, too much tightening and the bracket pops off the screw. I had to mount to the frame rail and used a 7/64 drill bit the screws bit well enough.Instead of wiring them to the car or cigarette charger Im using a 20000mAh jump starter with a 12v/10a barrel connection. The lights will run for over 3 hours straight at max brightness and strobe on this device and it can be charged in the car.Bluetooth receiver works well enough it's range is limited.You will get attention with these on your car.

 This product looks absolutely awesome as soon as it is on the car and wired and I absolutely love it. My problem was getting it on the car and wired. The kit came with a cigarette lighter port for power which is a lot easier but me and my friends did it through the battery. We spent a good 4 hours getting it all on the car and screwed in and after that we had to wire it. Wiring wasn’t that bad but we soon realized that with the app there is no way to turn off the lights all the way so it is constantly draining the battery. What we had to end up doing was wiring a kill switch into the car so you can cut power. Kill switch is sick but we had to spend a lot of extra time and money to get it done. Great kit but hard to get on the car and working.

 The product is amazing.Pros:Bright led lightsamazing effectsGreat for the priceCons: Takes a while to Install (But my car was super low) can be done in a driveway.The app layout works, just hard to navigate through the differnt chasing (Moving) effects.Still got the install done and, all strips work also, have not fallen off with the provided extra hardware protection I stall also.This install took me 6 hours (Mostely spent jacking up my slammed car 😂) and was well direction of where to put the wires, for the hard wired option, rather than the cigarette lighter option.Provided a few videos and images for reference.UPDATE, TODAY THE LED STRIPS JUST BROKE, WONT TURN ON JUST FLICKER, THEY ARE ALL IN GOOD PROTECTED SHAPE JUST BURNT OUT I THINK. I have check the wording 3 times all good, they just flicker for a moment then turn back off

Terence A.,5.0,2022 14 April,"
The kit is pretty easy to install. Running the lights is a little more extensive since the individual lights don’t separate. The instructions say to run to a fog light fuse. All I did was buy a switch from parts store and ran it from battery with inline fuse so underglow can be on without car running. I would recommend upgrading battery to a gel style to prevent battery from dying
"

Solid lights for a great price, I just wish the adhesive was a little bit better as the lights dropped in some spots.
"
Prophet068,5.0,2021 29 July,"
The Glue didn't stick well at all, ended up using other adhesive glue, but once they were in place it was great. I changed them to be one long strip by splicing the end of one to the beginning of the other vs the split processing these come as. If you know what you are doing, i like the contiguous vs half and half but i also do this stuff all of the time. So far they seem to be holding up well. I also changed the controller to use a WLED Based ESP8266, if you know the ESP, and again are comfortable with this stuff its a waaaaay better app than the SP510e, but i get why they packaged this as such. Overall i am happy with the cost of the package because i have tried to make these DIY and wasn't able to get the uniform sealing of the lights like these, nor as solid. Good thick wires, and solid connectors.

 I’m writing this review on the merits of the customer service alone. I purchased this kit and installed it on my 2017 Subaru WRX. Unfortunately one half the kit was having issues with LEDs flashing and not showing the proper pattern as the other side. After contacting the seller, I was immediately taken care of and I am waiting on the replacement LEDs.As for the LEDs that were working, the kit is AMAZING. The ability to quickly disconnect the sections of LEDs is a blessing when it comes to taking underside panels off the car. With the correctly configured settings, the lights give your a car a show look. Super easy to install if you have plastic panels under your car or anywhere you can zip tie it. The strip does have a strong adhesive, however I opted for a physical hold onto the strip (zip ties, brackets, and screws included in the kit.) I definitely recommend this kit to anyone on the fence about it.
"
Donk,2.0,2022 19 August,"
I literally got the lights installed fully and then they stopped connecting to the app.  Half are white and the other are whatever I choose on the app.  I checked initially to make sure everything worked and it did and checked periodically during the install and worked. After everything was put into place it stopped working.  Just spent hours installing this product for something to break within minutes not very happy.  They looked great while they were working and was very satisfied with how they looked.  I hope this can get resolved somehow because at this point I feel like I wasted my money for a broken product.

Mika,5.0,2021 25 March,"
They are nice and bright but the adhesive isn’t the best but they work. Not sure how they will hold up long term but will update in next few months. As far as connecting to a cigarette port. You will need to go to your fuse box and put in a 30amp fuse. Mine originally had a 20amp and I blew 2 just trying to install and then I just guested that a 30 would work and not blow and it worked. I’m still waiting on a reply from them about how many amps it kicks out because from what I read in the manual it didn’t say much. But for now the 30amp works good. Getting it to connect to your phone at first can be a hassle but when you get it the app is fairly easy to use and the lights are very bright. To give you an idea like the movie fast and furious bright. Yes the first movie. Hopefully this helps you guys.

 Love these lights! Easy install and came with all the hardware and used extra zip ties to sturdy it but came out awesome!Did make the mistake of installing it before testing and only one strip worked :( I did reach out to seller late that night but honestly wasn’t expecting a response since most sellers don’t care. I went ahead and ordered a replacement strip for $27.06 and to my suprise… emma(seller) reached out toMe and actually refunded my $27.06 for the inconvenience!! Sooo awesome! That alone makes me buy 2 more sets here in the next week! But back to the product! Definitely recommend

Cody H.,5.0,2021 29 September,"
They are so bright and beautiful, everyone i come across asks me about them and loves them. I've bought several diff kits and by far this is my favorite. The toggle switch on the cigarette lighter is a big bonus, I have my interior, exterior, and subwoofer lights all hooked up to it.The clips that come with it are a big bonus, no other packs have them. Install is super easy, be sure you use WARM SOAP and WATER to wash the area you wish to apply the adhesive to. Dont just slap it on with dust on. Take your time and you will have a really great adhesive stick.Bought my 2nd pair today. Ended up putting one of the strips in the Engine bay/grill, so they are all syncd.Have fun!
"
Gia,5.0,2022 29 March,"
The adhesion goes out very quickly and never held up without using a different tape as well as super glue.  Also, product claimed to be water proof but as soon as water came near the product it completely killed everything and messed up the led that wouldn’t turn off while the rest were off and majority of lights not going on when hued on

Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 30 July,"
These are way brighter then the tube design. The blue car has the tube style also purchased on Amazon. You will need some mechanical experience to install. Each side is all one length so you will need to start from the front and work way back on each side. App is decent and easy to use. It has 20+ programmed motion settings with 5 or 6 color combinations. You will need to add a 10amp in fuse if hardwired. You also need to pull the fuse if not driving the car everyday due to the draw on the battery even if the lights aren't on. My car battery was dead twice. I would recommend these lights 100%. I've only had them for two weeks so I don't know how durable this are yet. I will be purchasing more of these in the future.

"
Ryan,5.0,2020 7 November,"
Very true impressed with the brightness and colors! My kids love playing and changing the colors from our front window. Haha now Not necessarily hard to install but very time consuming.But about 2-3 weeks after installing one of the front 20inch strips won’t turn off. I’ve tried unplugging that specific strip, on and off all the lights, still stays on. Then the next day after the front strip the first 3 leds on the 60inch side strip stayed on.It looks like water got In some how but I’m not sure.I do recommend then but maybe add some clear caulking to the front and rear of each strip just for extra protectionUpdate- the seller has been more than helpful and willing to do whatever they could to help me get them working again. I replaced the front drivers side and the side LED strip after a refund from the seller. everything seems to be working great now!! highly recommend
"
carl,3.0,2022 24 March,"
The lights are super bright and they have vibrant colors, install was fairly simple and the adhesive on the strips is surprisingly good. The downsides however are that the application is quite clunky and switched power is a must! When the lights are turned off in the app they still draw half an amp of power to run the Bluetooth module so they will drain your battery if you hardwire. Overall though I am quite pleased.

 I have a 2019 10th gen accord sport and the underglow looks awesome on it. The install took me a while though because I wasn’t familiar with wiring to the fuse box and did 90% of the install alone. By myself it took me roughly 4-5 hours to get everything perfect but with friends should take 2-3 hours. I would slightly recommend buying some more clips just to make sure everything is secure. The actual adhesion on the strips is pretty decent but you might need some extra glue. All the wires are plenty long and I would recommend using the zip ties to tie loose wires and to run the wires under the fender liners. Overall though the lights look awesome and the colors are all very vivid and most the the effects are pretty cool. Definitely the best chasing underglow for the price.
"
Brandon,4.0,2021 14 July,"
Only 1 disconnect per side , so don't mount anywhere that youll need to come off the car in the future.. These are 2 strips coming together right at the blutooth box in the engine compartment.  I.e. bumbers or side skirts. That also makes it a bit difficult to hide the excess wire in the car. You'll have to be creative.If I have to take my bumper off for any reason now, I'll have to re 3m the front.Besides that, great 👍

I like the quality of product during unboxing, easy to install, and easy to set up. They are bright and have qlot of settings for lighting effects which is pretty cool. I did however have an issue where a side not lighting up after a week or so, but Customer service gets a 10/10 as they tried helpinge trouble shoot, and ultimately warrantied the faulty unit. People seem to get upset when things do not work, which is understandable, but things happen and things do break. I am thankful for a good company like this, that wants to take care of its customers.  So for me I would highly recommend this kit for any one wanting underflow and stand out from the rest

It’s a great underglow kit but I do wish the inheasive was better. Had to get the original set replaced due to the first set coming off but other than that absolutely love them!!!

 Well for the price this kit is great. These lights are bright and the 120 different sequences gives plenty of options to use. The kit is fairly easy to install, but it takes time to route the wires to hide them. I wired them to a switch but the provided 12v adapter works great as well. The adhesive tape provided is stout, but prep the surfaces with a cleaner with an adhesion promoter, and use the buckles for security. I wish these synced with the music like some others, but I’m very pleased with the results.

 Firstly, I love how bright these are. I brought these because they are app-controlled, so one can make any solid color under their car with eye-catching brightness. There are 120 preset color-chasing patterns, so many that there are bound to be several favorites in spite of there not being a custom pattern option, and I personally only use the rainbow pattern or a simple solid color. Favorites can be marked and quickly toggled in the app, and the speed at which the patterns run is very controllable. Custom colors are also able to be saved for quick access at any time the app is connected. I only had one issue with the control module which the seller quickly resolved, and have not had a system problem since. Once connected, my phone stays connected the entire time that I am in/around the car. All in all, it is a fairly simple install and a huge attention grabber!

I got this and spent a couple of hours mounting it underneath my vehicle with zip ties and such. Went to wire it, and could not get it to work for some reason. After two days, finally got it to work by tapping the power from one of my fuses. Grounded the negative wire. Well, after two days of sitting in my garage, my battery was dead. Even though I had powered the lights off and the fuse I was running off of was headlamps. Which don't supply power when the vehicle is off. But apparently the lights were still drawing power. I jump start my vehicle and low and behold, my entire instrument cluster panel no longer lights up. No gas, no rmp, no speedometer, absolutely nothing. And I have a digital cluster, not an old manual one. So it's completely blacked out now. I changed the fuse to no resolve. Now I have to figure this mess out. But I know one thing, it's thanks to these lights. Would not do this mess again. Two stars because the lights are bright and have many modes. I give them that.

 This is much cooler than it looks in the videos or pictures! It was very tedious installing and routing the wires and tucking it all safely away. Tons of bright and fun color choices. Now I can drive on an infinite rainbow road 🌈 or have fun at a car show. *be sure to check and follow all local laws

jesus,5.0,2020 15 August,"
This is actually the 5th set of lights that I get. And THE FIRST FROM THIS SELLER.The lights are perfect, (sadly I have experience), they stick jut perfectly, even though they bring everything you need to screw them. (Just make sure you clean the adhesion area first.) The glow on these lights are astonishing, after 6pm you can turn them on they will be noticed.  The Bluetooth range is impressive, 60+ feet, LOVE THAT. The app is super easy to work with, very simple. 120 preset styles and in my opinion the best things is the little heart it has to mark a pattern as favorite. (Also has like 12 solid colors.)  The customer service is impressively AAAAWESOME, I sent them some email about some doubts and they responded me within an hour!!!!! Loved that, it's hard to found, makes me feel confident when buying.  STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS LIGHTS

...after ~10 uses, several days of rain, and 1.5 months later, the left side doesn't light up anymore. My initial problem was every fuse I tapped, the damn thing would blow out that fuse. No matter what amp I used, no matter what. So I had to connect it to the cig lighter. Keep in mind, I tapped it into my cig lighter fuse, and it blew, but for some reason it functions properly when plugged in. Whatever, no big deal. I really light these lights and I will try to get in touch with the company to send a replacement. You can see what I mean in the photos. That'll get this up to 5 star.Note - the yellow light in the front are my fog lights, not related to the underglow. That little light gap in the front is barely visible in person, also. The first picture was in absolute darkness up in the mountains. The 2nd through fourth were in a very dark town, with some overhead lights on a pizza shop. The last two were early morning in my overly lit city.

Evan,5.0,2021 31 August,"
Took a few hours to install on my 350z with a friend. Fits nicely. We used battery to power and a chassis ground and wired in a switch to the cabin, soldering with speaker wire. The light wires were a great length in the kit. It worked and looked amazing for a while, then the first module died. Customer service was great and helped troubleshoot and eventually sent me a new one which works well. They recommend 5 amp fuse. I also installed this kit on a friend's s2000 and it looks very bright and easy to use app on both cars. Glad I didnt spend more on a different kit!
"
Jeremy,2.0,2022 10 April,"
Awesome product. not very easy to install since each side is a solid string. The pictures attached where taken with my camera exposure set to the lowest setting. The app they have these locked to is not the best. Id rather have an app that categorizes the light patterns and give the option to setup a custom program. Also the app need to be when I set a favorite I can goto a favorites page and name them. Also it needs to be able to link other lights together so i can change several lights with one app (ex. interior, under, engine bay etc..)Update. This is my 2nd set I've bought. The 1st set the side string started to display half white and no other color, even stayed on after turning off. The 2nd set just started doing the same, except on the opposite side.
"
Alex,5.0,2022 22 January,"
Just writing a review to say these underbodies are pretty good. They lasted a year before one of the bars went out which is better then most of the cheap kits on amazon. Debating ordering more as I did like them the color.chasings great. I just wish I could just get a replacement strip.

 I was ""on the fence"" about ordering these or a more expensive brand that is ""well known"" to my car group. I'm extremely happy I went went these! After the initial install, I had an issue with one of the longer strips staying constant white and it would not change colors or turn off with the app. Within an hour (more like 30min) of sending an email to customer service, I had a response and a new strip on the way with Prime shipping.The app is super easy to use and there are several modes to choose from. So far, they have held up in light rain and we will see how they hold up to a much needed wash and detail.
"
Car Nut,4.0,2021 13 March,"
I enjoyed the install of this kit. The only problem I had was the adhesive that holds the lights. I cleaned the surface before I installed the lights just to hold them in place and it just didn't want to stick. I will say the brackets they supply work very well. After I got the kit installed I turned the kit one and they worked great! I was really happy with how bright they are. Overall I would recommend this kit to anyone that is looking to make their vehicle stand out😁.
"
 Reece,4.0,2021 9 June,"
I'm thankful for the mounting brackets that came with the lights because the 3m strip on mine DID NOT stick at all. And would STRONGLY recommend adding a bit better directions for hooking them up for people who may be unfamiliar with wiring accent lights BUT those two grievances aside this is a SUPER solid product and if you have the knowledge and experience to install I DEFINITELY 10/10 recommend checking these out
"
M. Shattuck,5.0,2020 5 November,"
Ordered these for our Polaris Slingshot and installed within about 2 hours with my wife (she's awesome). Kit included everything we needed for installation with connection to the cigarette lighter (in the glovebox). The wiring was fed through the firewall directly into the glovebox which works perfectly in the Slingshot. The brightness isn't what you see in high-end kits but they cost a ton. For the price, we love these! I dinged a bit on adhesion in my rating because I've noticed that a couple of places have come a bit unadhered...however, I zip-tied the heck out of it all, so no problems whatsoever.Finally, after installation, we noticed that part of one of the light strands was not working. Customer service was very quick in getting a replacement strand out to us which solved the problem. I appreciate the service!

Fairly straightforward installation and app is easy enough to use. Mounted correctly these strips light up the complete underside of my truck and still shine out a bit to all four sides.  Had an issue with one side and the seller promptly remedied the situation, and had it going again a few days later. Now my girlfriend wants a kit because this 6 piece kit far outdoes her 4 piece.

Levi Payne,4.0,2021 17 June,"
After just under a year of having the whole kit and a few extra lengths on my car, everything works great except for one or two lights went out. Unfortunately they don't manufacture just the replacement strips anymore but Emma gave me a partial refund and guided me in the right direction for a replacement. Awesome company to work with and I'm very satisfied with the results either way.
"
Tamara,5.0,2021 15 January,"
The kit is easy to install but the vehicle will obviously play a bigger part in that. I wired it to my positive battery terminal and to my grounding spot on my MK7 GTI. I wired in a kill switch inside the driver's side compartment so I can turn it on and off while driving. You can adjust the brightness and speed of blinking/color changing. The app is straightforward. The only issue I had is one of the strips lost adhesion from the foam tape and was dragging on the road and filed right through the wires. Emailed customer service and got a refund to purchase a new rear strip. Every part of this kit can be bought seperatly which is awesome if this situion happens to you. Don't be afraid to purchase!

 For anyone new to working on their car thinking about installing this under glow is not easy to install. It can definitely be done, but there’s a huge learning curve for how to run your wires and where to place lights. This kit comes with everything you need to get the job done, except I’d recommend using some JB Weld to glue on the ends. looks super cool even in the daytime though
"
Kevin ,5.0,2022 8 January,"
These worked great on my car before I sold it. Installation is not for the faint of heart. But, the difficulty of installation has nothing to do with this product. I'm just giving a fair warning. I didn't experience any defects or issues while running these. I got compliments everywhere I went.
"
Abdias,1.0,2021 14 August,"
So where can I start, first I just wanna day the positive things cause there’s way to many negative stuff from my side. Well the brightness of this lights are great, can’t complain about brightness on this set. They stick very well to you car and I love how they have some hangers to bolt down the lights just to make it safer. It wasn’t that easy to install but that’s just cause of my car and the way I wanted them other than that pretty easy.Now the negative part:1. I don’t know if is the app or the lights that can’t seem to understand each other, when I press blue the light goes red, when I press red the lights goes blue.2. At the app There’s so many options for absolutely no reason when you finally find the right one so the lights respond to the color of your choice, the motion give the lights a stroke, meaning they just stop working and turn into white color and won’t change back to the color you want till they give a F*** to change back. Sometimes on side of the car goes one color and the other side another, or they don’t work.3.When they say they don’t wanna turn off, well guess what, they won’t turn off, I have to open the hood and disconnect the damn switch so they can turn off. After a 20 minutes of fighting for them to turn off. I honestly don’t recommend this set of light there’s so many bad thing I can say about them but just don’t buy them, Save you the trouble. A set of under glow lights should be easy to control not having a hard time and spending a lot of time just to try to make them work, cause they work whenever they want to work.

 Hardware supplied made for a very easy install minor modification to my rear bumper for clean install look but overall very satisfying with the look and quality of the product I have a really long car so I wish it came with extra pair of lights for the rear or maybe a plug to add additional lights just fill that but honestly not deal breaker for me super happy never liked the underglow lighting but this was game changer the chaser lighting is head turner every time and the brightness is amazing Plan your job well and this will be a breeze clean all contact areas well for best results

 I bought these as a gift for my girlfriends frs. They started to come off about after a month. To make it worse the colors stopped working with the app and wouldn't change to the right color. They looked really good at the start. I just wished they would've lasted longer.
"
Ruby,5.0,2021 6 March,"
We had an issue installing the product on to our turbo Miata where one of the strips broke. They sent us a replacement the next day and am super impressed with the response time. We love our little turbo miata and thought it would be fun to put these lights on our go-kart of a car. My boyfriend just installed them this morning and we played around with the settings with the lights off in our garage--will post pictures/videos once we take it out during night time! I'm super impressed with how many fun and different settings there are on the app! 10/10 would recommend. We ended up just using caulking to apply it on our car since the adhesive didn't stick very well.
"
Kpt.Krispy,5.0,2020 4 March,"
Like most lights you find in auto part stores and online, I was expecting these to be like the rest. I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of these light. The box they come in is nice. They took care to package them in anti static bags and they come with all the hardware you could possibly need. High quality 3M adhesive plus mounting brackets for extra security in your investment. Zip ties to keep everything clean. It even came with a cigarette lighter switch if you wish to turn it on/off from there. I personally opted out of that because I found wiring it to the fuse box was much easier. (Instructions included and very easy to follow) There's only one thing it requires and that's a wire adapter for the negative end to the battery terminal.  (Wire connectors if using the cigarette lighter switch) overall I was very satisfied with my purchase and the color chasing effect are very nice!

I am the one who placed the order and the install for my grandson. I am  old school muscle car guy not a light up the bottom of the car guy. Anyways hard wired it in with a relayFor key on only, no wires can be seenand no dead batteries due to forgot to turn off the lights. I think it's a good product but the install isn't like hanging cheap Christmas light better to have a radio /alarm shop hard wire it, finding the signal wire is not in the instruction manual alarm guy's or GPS guys know how to find the right wire .... As a used car dealer mechanicI remove after market electronics all the time. 3 star rating on install...

Korjo also does an amazing job with the Dream color function of the lights that other Led's cannot do. Overall great lights I have had them for over 3 months now for under glow on 2010 my smart car passion.

 Pretty good lights, mines is the one with only under glow lights. The two with lights on top, are another brand. The white with lights on top. Are Lite Up The Nite. Mines isn’t as bright. But also are less than half the price. The app works well. I’ve been using them every day for a week now. I’m happy, Just need more. Very easy to install, overall good buy.

Installation is simple, remove the tape and stick onto your vehicle, use zipties to hold the underglow up incase it ever decides to fall one dayBrightness is great for the value and the options you get are pretty amazing!I would purchase these if you want underglow for your vehicle and are on a budget for your project vehicle!Only thing I would wish for is if the sides could have came with longer strips,but overall not disappointed

So I ordered this product twice the first time I ordered it was amazing everything was perfect it was actually waterproof and the clips were soft that could be installed easily but BUT THE SECOND TIME. I feel like I got a really cheap product that doesn’t have any waterproofing at all or anything the clips are really terrible and doesn’t bend at all I haven’t checked the brightness I’m still installing it but this time I think ihv gotten a cheaper led

I had just recently purchased These lights about two weeks ago and I got them installed and they ran great they were super bright and they are so many different modes that you can select on the app. About a week after I had them I had went over a curb in my two front LED’s strips got destroyed because the curb was too high, and I reached out to customer service and they got back to me in about 12 hours and sent me two new front LEDs free of charge their customer service is great and will get back to you super quickly. I have washed my car myself and driven in the rain with no water issues yet and stayed on great. And for the price it was much worth it!

This product is awesome the adhesion is super sticky. Def recommend cleaning obviously before use. Due to my new car it was a pain hiding wires I had to pull tires and inner fenders out but that’s part of the game. I installed a fuse and a switch myself and wired it to my battery directly so it doesn’t pull power at all times cause I believe it will.  The Bluetooth seems to work seamlessly but it’s a pain that it doesn’t come with a remote also. A remote beside just your phone would be nice. But great product!

Duy Huynh,5.0,2021 27 April,"
I love these lights!!! I couldn't be happier with the result. A note, VERIFY YOUR GROUND. This was an easy installation and they look great at night. You have many choices in the colors and how you would like to have them shown. . They look amazing and are super easy to install. Overall love the kit and the service you get from the company. Colors look great and are bright for my need. My favorite part is the dimmer on the remote. You can turn them down pretty low which is great when your out camping and it’s pitch black out. Great buy. Well worth the money !

 These lights were even better than I thought they’d be. They are cheaper than ones you can get from the store considering they are blue tooth and they have 6 strips instead of 4. The spies are long and really bright. Plus the Bluetooth hasn’t messed up on me yet. You can customize different patterns or choose a solid color. Took about an hour and a half to install since my car is low and I didn’t have a jack. The adhesive is surprisingly great it really shocked me how good it stuck to the car. Plus the package came in about a week before it was expected to.Ps I was confused on where to power them but there should be a fuse box under your hood with a positive bolt that worked perfect for me

The LED lights were very bright. Highly recommend to use better adhesive. I give it a 3 stars beacuse I would of loved to have a controller come with it to leave in car because my for some reason would work to begin with but after playing with them they work perfect and still do. BUT!!! The color white is not so white as you know the color white. It’s more purple blueish so I was not very happy with that since I wanted the white mainly while in the road but over they are mighty bright!

 Lights work great wish the app had more options to customizeStick tape sucksMake sure you have zip tiesThe clear clips they send are great but they did not send nearly what you need (but zip ties worked after drilling some holes)Also make sure you supper glue the very ends to the clips bc they will come out of the clips
"
Nick,5.0,2021 10 May,"
This is prolly one of the best underglow’s I have worked with, the adhesive is super strong making installing super easy, only problem I can across is on the sides I had to drill holes for the screws but that’s okay. Over 120 custom colors, u can change how to pattern goes like from the front to the back, the back to front and the sides from front and side to back. U can change the amount of pixels it produces, brightness, how fast how slow the pattern goes, and best of all this is one of the brightest underglows out there

That in itself is worth 5 stars to me. Bravo. Followed directions to the letter. Lasted less than 2 months and fell off going down the highway. Caught the plug and ripped the whole set off and damaged my terminals.  Not a good product.

The lights themselves are great. Super bright and lots of color modes. I did have a problem with one side of lights and i did contact them and was sent a new strip of lights no questions asked.

I love this product. It's my new toy and it's hard waiting til it gets dark.A lot of people told me they like the lights.One guy said you have a disco going on underneath your car.I drive for Uber,and all the tourists at the Amusement parks stop and look when I pick up a rider.So I'm very happy. Thanks.

Was good until today, if you get the item and it’s defective at all have no mercy and return that ish. I just missed my return window and when I got it there was a slight defect and I didn’t mind it but today it rained pretty good and I noticed that one of the lights were a different color and I tried changing it and it didn’t work and then I tried to fix it by just tapping on that side and usually it would work but nope not today and after I took a really good look at it, there was a piece on the seal missing and moisture and water got in since I’ve had it but while it lasted it was good but 1 month of it working didn’t satisfy me at all
"
Ethan Miller,5.0,2021 7 July,"
Install was easy just time consuming and I love the brightness and the quality of the lights. The only bad thing about this is that 1 strip would only flicker then shut off or just never turn on and now im stuck with only half the car being underglow. Still waiting for customer service to reply to me. Would be 5 stars if both strips workedEDIT: Customer Service sent out a new strip for me and it came next day and now it works perfectly.
"
Dominic Wiggins,5.0,2021 3 November,"
With this kid you honestly can’t go wrong. It is simple to install it comes with adhesive strip at the bottom to stick to the car with the brackets to mount up the lights to your liking. And doesn’t require major installation to give you a car that unique look that you like.
"
Jordan,3.0,2022 1 February,"
I've had some LEDs on the strips burn out and start malfunctioning. Still waiting to hear back from seller... Other than that the 120 modes are cool and brightness is pretty decent!
"
Stephen Bartlett,5.0,2021 18 July,"
Product is fully functional the adhesion is nice if you have a flat surface to stick it to but I definitely used the mounting brackets that came with it and the zipties came in handy too.  Wired it directly into my fog lights because if you wire it directly to battery will drain the battery so now if foglights ar on they are on.  The app to use them is easy enough to use with a little time tinkering with it and figuring it out.
"
Ray,5.0,2022 23 March,"
You have to hide the strips otherwise they can be seen from the sides. Excellent product

 I love these lights!  Someone finally did what i've been asking for and gave us a kit that begins and ends in the middle of the vehicle, not off to one side.  It's a small detail but it makes a world of difference in how it looks.  My only complaint is that the front strips could stand to be a little wider for bigger vehicles (Mine are on a Dodge Ram)  Another plus is being able to add a name to each controller in the app as well!

 I installed these on my camper trailer. Install went well, great adhesive just make sure you use alcohol and remove any grease or oil. I mounted mine to a switch inside the cabin. Awesome lights and very bright.Only knock I can do and I'm not sure if it's the software or the hardware, but some of the light colorways are kinda weak. There are Maybe 4 or 5 really good color variances, all the others I'd never use.
"
Brett Clark ,3.0,2022 28 January,"
Not that bright. I have a friend that installs under glow. Do yourself a favor and buy something that’s brighter and better quality. If your going to spend hours installing them buy quality

John,5.0,2021 23 April,"
I love the product! Easy to install. The adhesive on it worked well except for one spot that I don't think I cleaned well enough. Was a bit. Annoying getting the wire over the wheel well. The strip would get stuck halfway. As for color it is amazing. I had the rainbow strobes on in McDonalds and had a compliment given to me. Had it all installed maybe 45 mins. Just make sure your state laws are okay with them. The town police didn't like them as much while I drove.

 These came out amazing. Cleaned the area well and it stuck on no problem. Little bit of a project getting the wires through the engine bay and around the front(steering) tires. But it comes with zip ties although I used my own. The one thing you want to make sure you have is terminals that connect to the wires that way you can connect the lights to power(battery). All controls are on app directions are a little tricky but pretty straightforward for the most part.
"
Renrick Phillips,5.0,2021 26 June,"
I purchase some under body lights few weeks ago was impressive but saw these on Amazon and decided to try them they easy to install the wires are good quality grade long enough to wrap around your car no cutting no splicing. These lights will make eyes turn..I wish the app could me more simple but u gotta play with it to customize it to your liking .lights worth every penny they super bright even in the daytime they stood out.

 Well if your looking for an awesome look and a cool feature for your car that will stand out this is definitely it it’s reasonable, the app works great you won’t be disappointed. I put on my underglow on  2015 Dodge Challenger  and it is awesome, I love driving down the road and people can see my daytime lights.  The installation was a lengthy project, but once you get done you feel certain that it will last and won’t fall apart like some of the cheaper kits, but other than that it’s a great product and definitely worth trying out if you wanna stand out.
"
Orland Orland Orland Orland Orland Orland Orland,5.0,2021 19 May,"
I have a 40ft 5th wheel and I love that I'm able to cover my entire front to back underbelly. My camper definitely stands out amongst all the other's. I love that it has an over abundance of color lighting variations/sequences. The ability to speed and slow the movements and the control of brightness is awesome! I can easily set the right mood and pick out my favorite light sequences. I would Highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to add more lighting to their RV.

 This kit is beyond amazing. It comes with 6 led strips rather than your typical 4 led strip kit for more coverage. The brightness is unbelievable as well, you can definitely see it in the morning which is dope. Going on to the most important part, the 120 different effects you can choose from, the chasing effect is epic, you can customize the speed of the chase effect which is nice, in the video I uploaded I slowed down the chase effect for the first couple of modes, the last mode I have the speed on 100 so you can have an idea on how fast it can be. Install was self explanatory & easy. Took me about 1 after I lifted my car off the ground. I already got so many compliments on the lights!!!
"
Xavier Patterson,5.0,2020 18 October,"
These lights are very easy to install if you have ramps or a lift. If you have tinkered with cars before, then hiding the loose wires will be easy as well. These light draw in a lot of positive attention and I was able to get a couple of people to buy some because they were very impressed with the results and the different light variations.Please check your state laws for which color you cannot drive with. In my state, it is illegal to use blue so I use every other color but blue unless I'm not driving on the road, then I would use it.

 I got them installed from a custom shop today and I got to see how they look at night finally and the colors are REALLY nice. The app is kind of confusing but you just have to play around with the variations to see which ones you like. I like how you can adjust the brightness. This is a really nice kit and good for the price too!

 What amazing lights! I purchased the Chasing lights for my house a few months ago. Then they came out with lights for my car! Believe me I’m picky about my car so I did some research!I was convinced these automobile chasing lights were high quality and suitable for my Mustang GT! I do a lot of parades and car shows and I knew these lights would make my car shine and boy was I right! I did a Christmas parade and everyone was amazed how the lights chased each other and change colors! (120different patterns) My car was the star of the parade, well besides the Big man himself Santa! I highly satisfied and would recommend these lights!** when hooking up light please hook them into your fog light! Factory recommended**

Mourt,1.0,2022 11 October,"
After my packages arrive I started to set up the underglow , when I was half way done setting it up under the car I then realized I should test to see how bright it is, once I hooked up the wires and everything it wasn’t working so I reread the directions and watched the YouTube video , still wasn’t working - so I decided to go to a shop and they told me the cigarette part wasn’t working. WASTE of my DAMN  money and time

Steven,5.0,2020 10 August,"
As you can tell by the title these stripes are very very long or at least for my Mazda 6 but regardless. Great lights for a pretty good price! nice and easy to install I have a Mazda 6 It took me an hour to fully install these lights. One issue I do have is that the app doesn’t name all the functions it’s just numbers them 1-120. I understand that there are just so many that it  just numbers them but could have a function in which I you could name them yourself but regardless great lights with very cool colors and patterns.
"
Martin hernandez,3.0,2021 16 November,"

 The Lights were pretty easy to install. I only had trouble with finding a spot to place them on my BRZ (Not a lot of flat surfaces for the sides). I also ended up replacing the 3M tape on the side lights with Velcro tape for a stronger grip. Over all these lights are pretty bright and I really like them. Recommend them to anyone looking for a inexpensive under glow.

 Love love love them! Just take you're time and run through wires good. Keep away from moving parts and exhaust of course.  Adhesive is very good but it also comes with these plastic brace thingies. They will never fall off ! Overall install took me around 3 hrs. Did take few breaks cause the weather outside was just too hot.

 The lights work great! I have never done something like this before to a car but I am very satisfied. The adhesive is good, not great, but an easy fix with some gorilla double sided adhesive. The installment process is tedious if you don’t know what you’re doing (like me) but it can easily be done. The fuze wiring isn’t hard just make sure you have the connector/jumper (sold separately). The lights are great though! Very bright and fun. They have SO MANY different modes which I loved. Overall 10/10 would recommend.

 The kit is very durable, it’s been through rain, car washes and high speeds I’ve had no problems with it, the only thing I would like to see changed is the app, other people can connect to my vehicle and turn my lights on which has happened 3 times and has caused me to have a dead battery all three times which is a huge hassle and inconvenience.  I love the colors and the brightness, it wasn’t hard to install on my car 2015 Dodge Challenger.

So I bought this led light kit for my car but the first one didn't work because it didn't have a second module. The light was flashing and couldn't connect to the Bluetooth device on my phone. I asked for a replacement and the second one worked as it supposed to. The second one has a second module (black box) which I believe made this kit work.

**update - customers service was extremely professional, sent me out a whole new set up. Very grateful to have a company take pride in there product and responsibility when it is necessary, great product, lights are amazing and many features  9/10 would recommend (9 given the first experience) **This product is great when it comes to the brightness but the quality isn’t there, I just got my light installed and one side does NOT work, it’s doesn’t change sequence, it doesn’t change colors at all it will just stay on white. Very disappointed as I waited a while for them to arrive and about the same time to install and payed quit a bit to have them installed as well. Was definitely looking forward to these lights :((

Nice! I like the colors. App works good. Easy install. Didn’t need to put any double sided 3m tape. I didn’t connect it to the battery because I didn’t want my battery to drain since it’ll be a live wire all the time. So i connected it to a fuse box and I installed a toggle switch that I can flip up and down on the car so it does not drain the battery.

I am very impressed with this kit so far! Easy to install and use. I did have one small rear strip not working fully but I emailed the support email address and they sent a replacement right away with no problem.I had to rely on the adhesive for the rear strips, so time will tell on those as far as how long it will hold.I feel this kit works better when closer to the ground for some of the effects. But overall I really like it!

alex ferrell,5.0,2020 8 August,"
Great looking lights, very bright and very solid looking, you get 120 different color chasing modes and although a couple do look relatively the same they are all pretty cool to look at. The app let's you control speed and brightness of the lights as well. Installation was easy enough just wipe down the area with isopropyl alcohol real good and let dry, would also recommend using a couple one hole straps to help hold them up. Customer service is great too, always a speedy response via email and always seems happy to help.

I bought this item for my Grandson's new car (he's 18) and he was thrilled with it.  The lights are vibrant, colors are gorgeous.  Easy to use with the app on his phone with lots of choices of how you want the colors to show up.  He said it was a little harder installing than he thought it would be, but did get them on.  My husband wants these for our golf cart so guess what he's getting for Father's Day??!!  The ordering was easy and delivery was perfect.
"
Jeffrey Pfaltzgraff,3.0,2021 24 March,"
Great product, multiple times that the zip ties snapped off, and lights sagged down. One time wire cut in half so I had to buy a replacement strand. I drove on a gravel road, and left side got torn in half, and right side had 2 holes straight through the strand of lights, along with the wire going to the back lights disconnected from strand. As long as it is properly fastened to the vehicle and take good care of it, this product will last a long time. The app was easy the navigate as well.

Lights look awesome. Easy to install. Great light combinations. Just that water got in the lights and shorted them out and I’ve been trying to see what could be done about that but couldn’t see where to contact the seller.

 I like the lights and and how they chase. Very bright but color coordination does not match up. When you try one color it's coming up a different color if you use red is coming up green if you use blue is coming up . different color not what you're trying to get and the app is horrible with communicating. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app for different times to get it to catch a signal

UPDATE MAY 2022: Purchased a second kit since I was previously extremely happy with my purchase. Obviously they lowered the product quality. Weather proof cover around the led lights are terrible quality. Wire gauge is higher (thinner wire). I took off 2 stars. From 5 to 3 stars. Such a disappointment!!!April 2021: Its almost like a headlight brightness. I can easily see the light reflection from the road even sitting in the driver seat. Dont hesitate to buy this product. Best underglow material by far.

 Product is good and bright only issue I have is that the length of the cables coming from the box are very short making you place the box somewhere in the engine bay. Hopefully it holds up to the heat and elements of driving..Update.. had one of my light fail so I ordered a second set and when it came it was different then the first no longer do each light connect individually now there all connected in a line. So my easy replacement turned into a full removal and replacement product changed and not for the better before you could not use every light now you have no choice.

I had a problem with one side one week after install on the first set.  They did send a replacement and they were great after that.  Now less than 3.months  later the other side half of the LEDs don't work.  I recommend this particular set to the people who asked where I got them from...however now I'm thinking these are not good for the long run, as I should get years out of a product like this.  Warrenty is only good for 30 days.  If they read this and make it right, I'll change my review, otherwise don't buy.  Many other options on here at a better price point, that may last longer than 2 1/2 months.

 Very pleased with this light set. Easy installation if you have a lift. App can be confusing at first and the Bluetooth connectivity is good. The cigarette lighter switch is nice as I used my 12 volt plug in the trunk for power versus going to fuse block.

I recently had to request a replacement strip because the wire in mine got ripped out and all I had to do was email them. Emma was extremely helpful and walked me through the whole process as well as answered any questions I had. 10/10 recommended

Evan,3.0,2021 6 August,"
It was easy to install, and looks great, but half of my under glow just failed for no reason.I tried turning it on and one of my back segments and half of the right side just wouldn’t come on.It’s great if it works, but now half of it doesn’t.
"
Aaron S.,5.0,2019 22 December,"
Can't speak on how hard the install is, cause I had professionals install it, but as the overall look, it's great. Pics provided of them on my car, gives you option of having it as a solid color, or the multicolored, as well as speeds on the multicolored. Only had these 1 and a half days, but they are great so far and I dont see it getting worse. Definitely will turn your car, or whatever you use it for into a head turner. I got looks from literally everyone that I passed in the popular shopping district near me.
"
Jesus estrada,5.0,2021 10 September,"
I have had this for one week now still in place still has that right bright quality glow! Gotten alot of good comments on my car so far. Definitely worth my buck!
"
WG,5.0,2021 9 April,"
The adhesion on these are on the best but I do give them that they are bright to install your going to need a few hours depending how many people are going to help you you also need to know how to splice wires other then that you should be fine
"
Dominic,5.0,2021 11 March,"

"
Michael Rivera,5.0,2020 14 August,"
I’ve bought a fair amount of different underglow kits. And I will be honest. When it comes to the price and the quality of the light itself it’s honestly unbelievable. Not only that I they also have amazing customer service as I needed to contact them for help and got a reply within hours. I’ve already installed 4 of these same kits on different cars because of how good they are. 10/10 would recommend.

 Love it. Looks great on my 2020 Corolla. Wasn't too hard to install. One of the LED strips was damaged and the seller immediately replaced the exact one within 3 days. Everything works as mentioned. The app is what controls the lights and there are PLENTY of lighting effects to choose from!! Instructions is perfect as well.

"
Luis Javier Perez,5.0,2021 17 January,"
Absolutely loved the product. I cleaned my car with rubbing alcohol first and then stuck on the lights and it hasn’t come off since and the car has been through rain, flood and highway speeds. The brightness is amazing too. And it has a ton of cool modes. Will definitely purchase again for my other cars.

The adhesive is garbage I had to use double sided tape with the adhesive in order for the lights to stick. But the screw-in clamps are a life saver! But overall if you not mechanically incline don’t buy this. But if you are mechanically savvy or you have a shop to go to then yes this is perfect!

First off let me say these are QUALITY lights. The installation was super easy. The app had no hiccups.

"
Kania Brown,5.0,2021 24 June,"

"
Kindle Customer,5.0,2020 22 September,"
The light kit was easy to install and looked great.  The vendor has very quick shipping and an OUTSTANDING Warranty.  My grandson installed the lights and really enjoyed them.  Unfortunately, one of the strips was damaged after installation and when I contacted the vendor they sent out a new light strip immediately!!!  Great support and a great product!
"
Alec,5.0,2020 3 October,"
The lights were very easy to setup, and very bright! The only negative thing about the lights in the adhesive, I took time to zip tie the lights just as a safety percussion, and they work amazing! Great lights, and for the price they're just amazing! I recommend them to anyone looking for a pair of cheap lights that work well!
"
jeff,5.0,2021 26 August,"

"
Mauricio Berber,5.0,2021 4 March,"
I highly recommend this kit because it has a ton of options on patterns, it looks really nice at night, and its high quality. Long gone are the days of installing neon tubes under the car and hoping they didn't break. Overall loved this purchase and the value.
"
Mike,5.0,2020 29 July,"
Fairly easy to install, sticks well but also comes with hardware to clamp it in place for extra stick and strength. You can do almost any color and even do jumping lights. The lights are fairly bright and you can adjust how bright you want them as well. As long as you can figure out how to tuck your wiring I would so far recommend this product
"

I ordered the same kit to use as replacement strips after one of the strips went out and the 2nd kit was different with connectors that weren't compatible so I had to completely redo the entire install instead of replacing the one strip that was bad
"
Anthony Servin,5.0,2020 4 October,"
Customer service is great! I had a couple small issues but the customer service is top notch and they always make sure to make it right. I would 100% recommend and buy again.Lights are also very bright and easy to use with the app as well. Install was simple and the provided hardware helped a ton.

Beatriz Hernandez,3.0,2021 22 February,"
We got these for a 220 A class Mercedes Benz. Adhesive was not strong at all. We had to figure out any other way to stick them. One full strip did not work so it was useless since the back side was way lighter than the rest of the car. Ended up taking these off and taking it somewhere to get other ones that have not given us any problems!!

I would give it 5 stars if it had a better app. The lights look great. So many different chase features. But they need a way to label each chase feature instead of trying to remember what number do what.

I received this in early November and shortly after receiving it I installed it. over the last week (three months after installing)I have had connectivity issues with the light strips. At first I thought there might be a loose wire or something but I have confirmed that all connections are good. Currently I cannot get the lights to turn on and it doesn't even register as a Bluetooth device.

The app has fast and easy connection, and it has 120 color pattern combos. Customer support is great and fast if you have questions or need replacements.IG: @asian.wrx

We have this installed on our Veloster.  We love this kit so much it is our second time purchasing.  First set we didn't have secured properly and it got caught on something in the road at some point and broke.  This time around we have learned from our mistakes and everything is well secured and working great.  Takes a little bit to install but isn't difficult.
"
Gisselle,5.0,2021 14 July,"
So basically, it’s a really good underglow kit. The front part didn’t really reach the edges of the front so that was an issue so you have to kinda just like diy it.
"
Gavin Scott,2.0,2021 10 November,"
The customization is awesome, app control was nice to have and it was a good brightness. Adhesion I had no issues with but I also haven't had for the longest time so, that may be an issue soon. However, after a few days of rain, a whole strip on the side has already went out. At first it started flickering random colors in certain sections, but now, the right side strip has ceased to work. A little bummed that they are already starting to break after some rain.

 Very well packaged and seems to be a very durable product. The leds a super easy to install by someone with limited knowledge and with limited tools compared to some units you may buy. The first set I got had one bad strip in it but they had me another set by the next day so no complaints their. They have amazing color and are very bright I love them would recommend to my friends
"
Cody,1.0,2022 25 August,"
Worked for like a month and then just stopped connecting to my phone. took it out to find that the black box on the controller part was all disformed from overheating which allowed water to get in. When I ordered a new controller and installed that one not even 5 minutes went by and the thing was hot to the touched. Just a defective kit all around.
"
Humberto Cera,3.0,2021 16 January,"
I loved this kit, it looks way better than ones I have used on other cars before. I had it on for about two weeks and then the driver side stopped working. I'm really not trying to remove it all and get the replacement and then have to install it all over again. It would helpful if we could purchase just one of the sections for replacement.

 you’ll need better screws for the brackets it comes with, and you better use all the brackets it comes with if you’re driving a lowered car & or in a state that snows. i loved my underglow but due to a blizzard and me only being 10” off the ground.. it didn’t last long
"
Arthur Padilla,3.0,2021 5 April,"
They fell off about after one day and some rain. I then had to follow up with the zip ties but then they were droopy because it didnt come with enough zip ties to put them every 3 inches. Id recommend a professional install or at a minimum put some super glue down

 These lights are really worth the money. They can be dimmed for a soft glow or turn them up, theres so many functions I never can decide on just one. I wish I could have included more than 1 video. Sorry I was looking for darker area than the lighted area in video. Install was super easy no special tools or anything like that. Very good quality.

One of the brightest underglow kit in the market!! I’ve had 3 underglow kits before from overrated brands but they were not brighter than these. This brand is definitely underrated. You’ll definitely turn heads on streets with this bright underglow kit! The customer service is awesome! They’re here for us 24/7. Highly recommend it💯

Stan B.,3.0,2020 24 September,"
The lights work well. App is a bit strange. Mounting the lights was horrible. Adhesive doesn’t stick well and the self tapping screw mounts will break or are a pain. I wired to cigarette lighter as I didn’t want them hard wired. Cool if you can figure out a good way to mount them but good luck with that. I had 4/6 strips come free in the span of a week (granted with heavy aggressive driving)

 Had a little issue at first but the customer service was excellent.  Jumped right on it and couldn't be happier with the results. Pictures don't do then justice.  These lights are installed on a 2019 Mustang gt Premium show car. Every where I go I'm complimented on these.

Used this light set on a mustang. Bright glow. Speed and brightness is adjustable. Color chase looks good, lots of settings. Quick app download for controls.

 Lights are very bright the two way tape on the back of this is crap doesn’t stick very well I had to mount every 6 inches clamp because they would not stick to the plastic at all even being clean with alcohol would not stick Other than that I’m generally very happy with them other than I was hoping to not have to put that many clamps on

These guys have awesome customer service, I had a few questions about it and they were all very friendly and informative. The product itself, I'm impressed with. There are other kits on Amazon but I'm happy with my choice on this one. The patterns, combinations and even brightness of this are incredible. Would recommend and buy again.

Lights look great I get lots of compliments, make sure when installing clean all areas were the 3M tape will be. Wish there was extra 3M tape to put on the receiver.

The install for this product is extremely painful especially on a Chevy Malibu. Keep in mind there are two different screws sizes one for sheet-metal and one for plastic.
"
CRYSTAL C.,1.0,2022 4 May,"
I have been through four sets of these lights in within a month of installing them and one way or another they stopped working or break. When they do work they work good very bright colors. I love the rainbow options. But for $80 and they only work for maybe a month it’s definitely not worth it. The adhesive they sent with it is definitely not made for the underneath of a car. And unless you have a car lift that can lift your vehicle a few feet off the ground it is next to impossible to drill the little screws that they include in the kit into the bottom of your vehicle.

Hello I received these lights and installed them, they work awsome super bright and stands out from the other $30 underglow kitsI did receive a broken led strip had it replaced and got a new one ASAP but once installed the new one had a few lights not working causing the rest not to change colors, definitely recommend these lights I just got 2 bad sets

"
Adam,3.0,2021 20 April,"
Great hardware and super straight forward and easy to install, not very bright though. I own a relatively small 2Dr coupe and the strips even overlap in some spots yet the light barely bleeds out from under the car when the strips are on at night.

Lights are very bright and super easy to install! The color chasing effects are very cool as well. If anything comes faulty they’re pretty quick to replace it as well. Have had them for a month and they’re still perfect even through rainy Florida weather!

This is my very first time putting in underglow lights and worst experience yet. I have no idea how to even describe this but say wow. I don’t understand how the cord and the light bust/explode. My whole right side of my under light don’t even turn on and most of the lights are burned out. I for sure will look for a replacement or return fee for these lights!
"
Tye Pierce,5.0,2021 6 February,"
By far my favorite underglow on Amazon! Easy install, adhesive could be stronger but the clips help a lot, brightness is pretty bright but I would like for it to be a little brighter.

The lights are beautiful I bought them for my Slingshot. The day of installation my phone can't find the bluetooth link that controls the lights. It was fine yeaterday when i tried them but now NOTHING. Disappointed and will be returning them if Customer Service can't help.Update: reordered and now have 2 sets the only problem is my Bluetooth is only controlling 1 set of the lights and can't download the same app. Anyone knows how to control 2 sets on 1 Bluetooth.

Jeremy Adkins,1.0,2022 29 June,"
This product used to be completely waterproof, sealed leds with no air between, sectioned so each light was replaceable individually and no cheap white caps that lets water in. I bought a second kit to replace damaged lights on my car but it’s not compatible anymore. All the things that made it rated so highly are now gone and it’s the same kit as all the other cheap underglow lights on this website. Don’t expect it to last.

1st & foremost, this is an AMAZING LED. Love the Chasing features. My only concern is that this is my 2rd purchase. 1st one had all the light separated, able to attach, detach individually... the 2nd one, all 1 piece. Disappointed. Now I may hv to remove everything I did before & start all over again. I was hoping it was the same way, so that I could just remove the bad piece & attach a new piece. Smdh ... the only thing that comes to mind is cutting the cable to add the 1 piece I need. That means, soldering wires. UNNECESSARY.

Very disappointed because my lights only lasted 4 months and now will not turn on…. I have never had a problem with them before until one night i turned them off and then would not turn back on. Very dissatisfied with the customer care especially! I have messaged and emailed them multiple times and have yet to hear any response back from them. Other than that, these lights are very bright and comes with a good quality app.

Mason bush,5.0,2021 4 February,"

I have bought 2 sets of these. The first ones worked for maybe 2 months then one side went completely out. They sent me a replacement strip and that one didn’t connect to the bluetooth receiver so I couldn’t change the color and it was stuck on white. Decided to buy a whole new set and before I put it on my car I checked and make sure everything worked right and it was fine and then when I got it on the car one strip in the back was stuck on white and the rest on one side of the car wasn’t turning on at all. I messaged them and told them I wanted a full refund but they told me that they could send a free replacement strip and I told them I don’t want a replacement strip and that I just wanted a refund and I never heard back from them. Not very happy. Don’t recommend at all.

I really didn’t want to leave a review for this, but I couldn’t find a way to contact the seller. These lights worked just fine and everything until I got pulled over for not realizing the left strip flashing blue and red (of ALL colors), then right after they started glitching out all around. I always keep them on the same color but they started flickering constantly which isn’t legal where I live by any means.I checked the wiring and everything is as it should be, no damage, nothing. I would prefer a replacement, but a refund worst case, mostly considering if they were going to crap out like this I could have bought cheap Walmart ones on top of the fact that I had a not so nice police officer write me a ticket for it.
"
The Mahabirs,5.0,2020 11 January,"
Extremely high quality LED kit. Both the brightest and most customizable kit i’ve ever seen. I’m extremely happy with the kit and it’s well worth the money. One request is that they upgrade the app to allow customization of your own modes and sequences, that would make this kit the absolute best!

Lights were installed by a professional for $250.  They are defective and will not turn off.  I took it back to the professional and he could not fix them. The only way to shut them off after all troubleshooting was tried was to remove them from the battery.  Now I have to pay $150 to have the defective ones removed, send them back to Amazon…. and another $250 to have new ones installed.  I’ve only had them approximately 4 months and only use them for special events.  Huge hassle that i have to pay to have them removed properly to get a replacement.

I must say that I'm highly disappointed. I bought these lights back in December and I didn't even install them until now, which is May and on one other strips past the first set of lights they don't work. Work. Aside from that, everything else with the product was great, I literally spent 3 or 4 hours install them. I should have checked them before I'd wasted all that time and doing it.

 Update:10/21/2021Welp, I WAS enjoying  my lights until I went to drive my car recently and it wouldn't start. The battery was very low and wouldn't kick over so I had to get a jump. 2 days later, the battery was completely drained. Nothing worked...key fob wouldn't even unlock my doors. I disconnected the lights just to see if they could have been the problem and sure enough, I haven't had an issue since. Now I have to get them taken off. It's pretty disappointing to say the least.Original Review: The lights look amazing. I had a good mechanic put them on. He zip tied em down so they aren't going anywhere. Of course, the lower the suspension, the more pronounced the glow is. But for stock height on the A7 Jetta, the lights glow beautifully.

They broke just a couple days after installing, the lights flash on their own, and there is a strip in the back that won’t turn off with the others. Cheap

 Lights are very bright, easy to install and customer service is great as well. Overall great product! I get looks and compliments every where I go.
"
Sean G. Todd Esq,1.0,2022 31 May,"
The app does not ""see"" your lights - they don't work.  Period.  Emma with customer support did provide initial guidance on what to do to get them to work. In all fairness, the fixes were rudimentary and already done:  like uninstalling the app/ reinstalling the app.  Emma offered to ship another controller and has not done so to try and fix the issue.
"
Lori,5.0,2020 6 September,"
Great customer service I had a problem with one of the strips they sent me a replacement right away. They are very easy to use and they are bright.

They do not stand behind their product and require you to ship in your faulty strips to get any support. Better off buying from another brand. Lasted all of 24hours and already needed a replacement strip. fast forward another 12 hours and the main unit is now faulty using their install equipment (car charging plug).

"
Kyle C.,2.0,2021 2 June,"
The product was easy to install I found that using double-sided sticky tape for the best but after two weeks of use they will not turn on connect to Bluetooth I mean if you’re paying $70 for some under glow lights I kind of expected more than two weeks I heard there is a warranty on the lights and we’ll see how that goes I guess
"
Emmeline,1.0,2022 26 May,"
I install with a profesional, tuened on only to last 20 mins and then not work, contacted seller for a new one and 0 response and amazon wanted me to send back product when it was disposed of due to not working. Very upset i spent money and did not get to enjoy and no way to get product back

Keith Caldwell,2.0,2021 27 July,"
Product does NOT work as advertised. Lights come on, but Bluetooth does not connect.I've purchased this product twice, two separate Bluetooth controllers, two separate connectors. Lights are hard connected to fog lights, as recommended by documentation. Clean solder joints, no butt connectors.Lights come on, Bluetooth never becomes visible in the app.Steer clear of this product.

SSH,1.0,2022 4 February,"
Seemed like they would be good quality after the reviews but right off the bat the plug in part doesn't work. So after I hardwired it I was hoping it would work then but if by some miracle you get the app to connect to the lights and set your preferences, good luck connecting it again the next time. There's a reason the LED Hue app is rated so low. Not even worth all the hassle they were to install. Very disappointed.

Loved the lights when I first got them. Then it rained and it stopped working. The adhesive came off so if you do install them use 3m tape cause that’s the only way they’re gonna stick.  Can’t get in touch with the seller and Amazon won’t refund the money so I took a giant L with these.

This product is amazing I'm not gonna lie. About it. Super easy to install. The 3m is fantastic. But I thought this was waterproof. Few car washes later (washed by hand) and my lights start bugging out. Like this isn't ok. I had some issues with the controller. They were nice enough to send me another one. But now this issue. Kinda makes me not feel confident about this. Kinda want my money back because of this. Update. Got in contact they were nice enough to send a replacement strip but after one rain storm. I get a call at 5 am from my father saying that my lights were on. I come out and see that it was. I took it off and see that it was all corroded. 2nd pic

The lights themselves aren't that difficult to install if you just plan things out where you want them beforehand. Beneath the vehicle they look nice, BUT and this is the kicker so I've been unable to connect the app to the lights to use all the settings and patterns described in the packaging. So right now I'm stuck on 1 pattern until I'm able to connect. I've tried multiple times to use the app that the package described.2 Stars until I can get something going..

So at first, these lights were amazing. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED them. Then a strip died after 2.5 months.  I would be willing to re-write this review because of the initial satisfaction, if it was replace. But I believe that the strips should last longer than 3 months and that it may be a defect in the kit I receive.

If these were like $20 they wouldn't be too bad. I have owned several under glow kits and I can tell you now, do not get the flexible ones. Mine ripped apart and were dragging for a week until I had time to remove them. Get any that are the solid aluminum rails, they will last you years if installed properly.

2nd time purchasing this. I live these they are great brightness u can go what we color yiu want with dream effect. However this time around was a let down :( not even days later and some of the neon won’t turn off like they say on and the only way to turn them off is to pop yiur hood in screw a battery terminal and disconnect. Kinda sucks to have to do alllll that just for some underglow. Update been trying fir a month but they just don’t work waste of money

First set didn’t work so they were returned, after a little bit of a pain in the butt they got replaced. Easy to put on, good brightness control, no real downside. Good fit for my little wannabe rally car!Update. These didn’t last a year. Only one of the led bars still works at all. First problem was this winter when the back end of the one on the drivers side couldn’t be turned out within pulling the power source. Then the rear stopped working followed by the one I had in front.My search continues for a set of underglows that can survive a northern winter

It was easy to install which is why I’ll give it 1 star. That being said it almost caught on fire and I was forced to rip it all off to keep my car safe. I wouldn’t bother with a review if I jerry-rigged the lights myself but I did EXACTLY what the instructions said to do. I’m not sure if I got a faulty unit but just be careful about what companies you buy car accessories from. Could’ve ended badly!
"
DJ,1.0,2021 7 April,"
Im very disappointed... It was such a EXTREMELY BAD idea to wire the lights all together as 1 long divided (yet wired) 3 peice strip. I orded these lights once before and you could connect them in different ways but now that you cannot connect them at all (because they are wired) it makes it difficult to free style your light set up...SMHIn 1 picture each strip has a connection on the endOn another picture there is only 1 connector with 3 strips wired together

Art,1.0,2021 12 April,"
At first I was in love with these lights, until about three months after installing. They started off good then one day they took a crap. The strips started to get out sync with the app. I contacted the seller and they gave me a few troubleshooting tips which were all unsuccessful. I sent videos to help clarify my issues with the lights so finally the seller said they would replace the strips. I haven’t heard anything in months. I’ve tried reaching out again with no response.

I know zip ties come with and you have to mount but I needed it to at least stay for a week, couldn’t hold adhesive at all. I don’t recommend.

Hugo Estrada Jr,1.0,2020 29 October,"
This product is great. Installation was a little difficult to install, but only because I’d never wired anything before. Still, the installation instructions were easy to follow, and the lights themselves are BEAUTIFUL. Worth every penny.The only reason I’m giving this a 1 star is because the adhesion itself didn’t even last a week before it started peeling. In the picture, the adhesion is still sticking, but the LED strip fell off the adhesion. I was so disappointed given that the adhesion is a 3M strip. It fell off in the rear and fell off in the front.

I bought these a moth ago and it ""was"" really cool before it turned on by itself while I was at work and i realized I couldn't turn it off because the bluetooth stopped working. I literally had to pull the negative connection from the battery to turn it off. It's crazy the bluetooth stopped working so fast.

Lights worked good for about 10 minutes at first try. Then later that night for about 10 minutes. The next day I try the lights and it will not pick up on my phones bluetooth list. I've re-downloaded the app and restarted phone with no luck. Left unconnected for 48 hours & reconnected system with no luck.  Not happy at all
"
Anthony M.,1.0,2021 7 July,"
After installing as directed, the lights lasted 2 days before they broke. The glue on 2 of the strips had already let go, and 5 of the provided attachment were broken. Also, because the attachments didn't fit the strips properly, they were left dangling around after the glue let go.
"
Michael Goncalves,1.0,2021 11 May,"
Lights looked and worked great for about a week. After a small rainfall left side of car didn't work. Then right side faded next day. After 4 days since the rain they stopped working altogether. I'm guessing water got between the silicone. It's a shame because I meticulously installed them to be invisible to the eye

Bought this about a week ago. I cleaned my car with soap and water, followed by alcohol and then stuck the lights on. Wiring was a bit of a pain but was to be expected, however what got me was THEY FEEL OFF THE NEXT DAY. Do not buy.
"
kevin,1.0,2021 4 May,"
The front section coming off the Bluetooth box has about 4 inches of cord. It’s impossible to install without a $20 extension cord. Not happy at all with this set up. Only good I’d say is it’s bright but a pain to do on a car as in their diagram.
"
luis Man,1.0,2021 9 April,"
bought these after a friend recommended the product, but he failed to mention that the LEDs on the whole right side would disconnect from the rest, not physically but electronically. so now i can only control the left side and the right side is either not on at all or it sometimes flashes white.

 I love the brightness, choices of settings/colors, Easy installation process, easy to use app but at a car meet yesterday at a car meet my passenger side stopped working properly. When changing settings only one side changes, when I turn them off my passenger side stays on. (Ended up having to drive home with flickering lights and the risk of getting pulled over/ticketed) I’ve had them for 2 months and they were working perfectly with no problems. I installed them on my sisters car and hers work with no problem. I am not sure how to contact the creator for a replacement so writing a review is my only choice. Like I said they’re a great product and is still working on my sisters car but my passenger side is having a mind of its own.
"
Darryl Thomas,1.0,2022 30 June,"
I did as I was told. Checked the wires before installing. I powered them up in the box and everything worked. 3 months later warm weather finally comes around I go to install and the wires has a short after the first strip of leds. Of course past return policy now.
"
connor,4.0,2021 30 June,"
The 3m adhesive is garbage but it comes with mounts and screws so use the mount on plastics and then for the sides ziptie it and mount with screws to your frame, the brightness is vivid as ever, also the Bluetooth controller if getting constant power (wired straight to the battery) it will die very soon meaning the Bluetooth controller will stop receiving signal but they sell a replacement controller for 10 dollars other than that it's been the best kit I've ever owned

 My girlfriend bought me this for my birthday and after about 3 hours I had it all in place. The hardest part was getting under my car cause it’s so low. The adhesive tape works really well but I would recommend using the clips if you can. The app worked great and connected easily. I love the brightness of the lights and they look amazing. I did have an issue where they stopped working but randomly came back after an hour and work again. I will update if I have any more issues but so far I’ve loved my experience with them.

 I absolutely love the lights. They really were easy to install. To be safe, I actually cleaned all the areas under my car to ensure they stuck well. After installing, the lights were very bright and has so many different options on your phone with the app. I’m a car enthusiast so I go to car meets and people absolutely loved how the lights had the rainbow option and it all changed in a beautiful way. This is a very VERY good product. And the customer service is definitely great as well!

Syme - See Clear/Speak Plain,2.0,2021 18 August,"
My son bought these lights for his Subaru STI, and I agreed to help install.  He said YouTube confirmed slam dunk, sip iced tea install (I knew better).  Ridiculous nightmare routing wires and finding surfaces to attach lights.  Brackets are crap, and who wants to drill holes in the bottom of your car when you live in the salty road winters of the rust belt!  I zipped tied and cursed like a fool!  Then, the power source is supposed to be routed to the lighter?  What kind of mickey mouse setup is this?  His lighter already hosts other electronics.  Plus, the fuse panel is proper sourcing, but only after your buy a proper fuse setup etc etc.  The lights look good on day 1, but don't let you son trick you into believing the install is snap, boom, bang!
"

Last night the lights were perfect I took a couple of pictures for Instagram and made a YouTube video showing how well I had the wires tucked and how well the different lights looked at night. This morning I drove to work, came outside on my break to try to wire the interior lights I also ordered off here. As I approached my car I noticed wires that were very well tucked and secured hanging down loosely. I follow it and it ended at the black connector part, it was also still connected. What came loose was the wire broke out of the connector piece which led to the long led light for the side and the back. The adhesive on that side fell off as well, resulting in it hanging down. This is on the passenger side. The passenger front bumper lights still work as they are still connected to the main controller box, but now my side passenger and back bumper can’t light. I’m very upset right now, I had installed them myself and even had someone who charges 300 to install them check my installation out. I was extremely happy with the brightness of the lights and how they had the color flow, I’m just sad now looking at only side of my car lighting up. Really defeats the purpose of me having them on. If there is anyway, I would greatly appreciate it if I could have one pair of the long ones and the shorts one sent to me. I’ll remember next time to add super glue or something to the 3m tape so it won’t come apart next time. The instructions didn’t say anything about adding extra adhesive, but I’ll be sure to take that extra step next time. I would DEFINITELY give this review 5 stars if the 100% satisfaction guaranteed statement is expressed through the customer service and assisting me with my replacement.

Adhesion of the tape was not the best. But got some double sided Gorilla tape for under the vehicle and stuck the lights to it. Works flawless with the app and has lots of options for moving lights and combos or solid colors. So far so good. I'll update this if they end up suckin

 With the exception of the adhesive script period. These are some of the brightest underglow lights I have had. Easy to install, great shipping, the plastic brackets will come in handy when it comes to securing the lights periods but they do stick well on metal.

Very easy to figure out on the install. Should include toggle switch and more mounts. I ended up using zip ties to hold front and rear in place because no where for screws for mounts. Be sure to get larger zip ties when placing your order. Over all very bright and the led are unclosed in rubber casing. Best I have seen so far. As for the adhesive I recommend sanding and wiping down with rubbing  alcohol for best results. I am very pleased.
"
Glitterest,4.0,2020 29 September,"
The only reason why I'm giving this product 4 stars is because it should have come with extra extensions cord for the underglow but other then that I am Very pleased with these lights, they are very bright and easy to install also easy to connect to bluetooth.

The product itself is amazing for the price. This is my second underglow kit and so far my favorite. It is extremely bright, sticks on as good as it possibly can, and comes with connectors in between the led strip for easy replacement and installation. The product is amazing for the price but the best part is the customer service. I had a faulty led strip and they responded quickly to help me out.
"
Bo,5.0,2020 31 July,"
Way brighter than the Govee brand. And it has 120 moving effects.I can actually see this one in the evening, it doesn’t have to be completely dark like with Govee. Definitely worth double the price of Govee.
"

Lydia,5.0,2020 20 August,"
I love these lights. They’re bright but not blinding and they were fairly easy to put in if you take the time to research and actually pay attention. It’s easy to change colors and I love how it comes with an app on your phone.

Derek Clay,5.0,2020 17 August,"
I bought these for under my Tahoe Limited along with like interior ones and all was well worth the time and money spent! These lights blow away all the others sold on Amazon or the set I had prior these! Be prepared to grab attention and asked where to get them! The pic was just a quick add and don't begin to explain how badass these lights are once lit the 1st time! Buy now if debating and you'll be happy!

Bought this for the interior of my outdoor/camping/off road vehicle, it definitely did what I was hoping it would! Installation was easy, everything stuck in place with the help of the silicone brackets. Not to mention it's super easy to use with the app control on your phone. Lights can be dim or super bright depending on the situation. I highly recommend!
"
Tim,5.0,2022 24 April,"
Loved that the front and rear come in 2 pieces. It fills up the whole section. The sides are long too. I was afraid they were going to be short and look funny like I see on other cars but they are not. They are very bright. Bluetooth works perfect. 120 different color sequences. Adhesion is very good but use the clips or zip ties to make sure they are secure. Very happy with this kit.

 I am extremely happy my KORJO underflow lights.  They were not only easy to install and look amazing....  but the customer service is out of this world!  There were some initial defects once I installed (ehh..  it happens with electronics)...  but I sent an email late in the evening and was thinking it would be forever before I got a response.  NOPE!!!  5 minutes later I got a response and had a replacement shipped....  Fantastic! Fantastic! Fantastic!  If you are not getting your lights here..  you are making a mistake.  Great deal, Great value, Awesome lights, & Amazing customer service!!!!  WOW!!!  Just WOW!!!  Thank you!!!

Logan C.,5.0,2022 5 July,"
I recently bought my first car and wanted to add some under-glow, saw these were the number one on Amazon so I went with them. I will admit it looks very intimidating at first. So many wires and clutter but don't let this fool you it's incredibly straight forward. Took me about a day but after I was done I was so happy with how it came out. I am not experienced enough to wire it directly with the car so I opted for the 12 volt connector. I also ended up using a 4 pronged led switch as well to help me easily switch the lights on and off and it was incredibly easy to do as well. I seriously recommend this as well! And don't be fooled, you don't really need to jack the car up, it might be harder but don't let that stop you from trying.

Updated review. This kit WAS awesome, then it stopped connecting to bluetooth after 3 months. I'm a professional, so I know it's installed perfectly. Bought another kit, and it only connects for 60seconds, then disconnects.  Downloaded app on a different phone, same issue. So disappointed! I'm not going to buy a 3rd kit. I'll look elsewhere.

Krisna,5.0,2021 5 November,"
Ended up installing this product myself and was very pleased about the outcome. The lights are bright and having the 120 options of different light patterns which was exactly what I was looking for. The lights are eye catching and everyone asks me what kit it was and I’m happy to say Korjo. I have not had the best luck because my LED strip has been hit by something to cause them to not work but I emailed the company and was directed to an employee named Emma. Emma has literally been helping me out with timely emails and giving me a lot of respect and understanding. She was able to communicate with me about what happened and then sent out a replacement LED strip within a couple of days. Emma has been very nice to me and is the person you want to talk to if you need help!
"
Brian Hardaway,5.0,2021 23 July,"

 I had bought 2 different sets before these for way more expensive and not even close to being as good as these!!! I recommend these to everyone who asked about them and I always get alot of positive attention with these on. Also it's hard not to drive every night with them on. When cruising with my cousin who also has of set of these on his car, I guarantee you we remind people of the fast n the furious when we're rolling by. Copp these while you can, best price too!

The installation is a bit difficult, if it is just a problem of installation, it is not a big problem. After I use it for 9 days, the light will not turn on. Press red, it will come out blue, press blue, it will come out red, and then it will not come out. worked, I don't recommend it

Amazing product, entertaining as well. Worked amazing and was extremely bright, many fantastic functions specially pared with interior lights. Start up early this morning 30 days later.  showed driver side was very dim compared to the other side come this evening they are starting to flicker.Update: found fault at solder. Repairs it and it's working amazing. I can't express the excitement something so silly can bring. Young and old love the lights.

 These lights are super easy to Install. You may need to do some research on how to run the cables. For my 5th gen camaro I ran the through the back seat into the truck. I placed the Bluetooth sensor in the trunk and worked my way from the back up around the wheels. There is a whole in the botoom of the trunk that lined up witg the center of the bumper. I zipetied the exercise cable to the under side of the wheel wells. Took me about a hour and a half. Be sure to clean your surface really good before attaching the tape side of the lights. Other then that really great product ans awesome results when installed correctly.

 These are fantastic for the price! They’re very bright. I keep mine at half brightness which is plenty! It has so many different colors and pre-set combinations. It’s very simple to wire up. If you can’t do that, you can plug the adapter into your car’s cig charger.The LED strips have a 3m-like-strip on the backside for installation. Once they’re stuck, you have about 4 brackets per strip as a second safety precaution. Luckily the brackets fit over like a glove.6 of the LED lights in one strip stayed on when I turned them off with the app. I could have easily returned the kit for a new one with no issues. Instead I wired a switch to my battery to cut power so they’d turn off. That was easier than uninstalling the kit.I couldn’t recommend this kit enough!P.S.In the picture/video I provided, there are lights in the wheel wells. Those are not apart of this kit.

Got mine in today, was installing it and it worked for an hour or so while I was installing it but I put it on white to finish it up and I go in the app to shut them off and. Nothing. The app completely stopped working so now not only are they stuck on solid white but I have to disconnect them from the fuse/ ground to shut them off.Update, I found that there is an issue between the connection from the harness to the lights but I emailed them and the customer service was very friendly and quickly offered to send a new harness with a control box. Hopefully it resolves the issue so I can be a true ricer

After receiving my lights I didn’t know I had to buy hardware for it because I knew the thin 3m adhesive wouldn’t work. I spent $15 in hardware so I couldn’t mount the lights to later finding out this product was supposed to come with mounting clips but I did not receive them in mine. Otherwise they are nice and bright.

So the adhesive strip was a joke I recommend using 3M tape to secure the strip while installing the clips and screws it comes with!

Having said this while it did work it was pretty dope definitely turned some heads

Within 24 hours of installing both side strips fell off and drug under my car on the interstate ruining it. It was a good product until this and I’m unable to get in contact with the seller for a replacement. I will change my review if they are able to provide me with a new unit. Until then I am very dissatisfied.Update they shipped me a new set almost immediately which I have already put on and looks great! I believe my first attempt was my error as I didn't use the clips they had sent. This round with the clips I doubt these strips could come off if I tried! Very good seller would buy again.

 Let me start this review off with a little backstory, This is my third LED underglow strip for my car, I have had two break on me; one broke with the wire snapping before an LED strip and the second with water getting in one of the led strips on the side. Let's just say I am very careful with buying my third LED strip. And I am quite experienced on installing them.Pros:- Very bright- More coverage (looks more full)- More customization (lots of LED options)- App is user friendly- 3M is holding very well (20 car washes and some snow and rain)- Seems to be water proof. (More on that ↓)- Multiple options of install (Just the stick, or screwing in it)This is the thing I will get compliments on constantly when I have them on and at night, at car shows etc... So far this is the best LED strip I've had for my car, with that being said I have only had it for about a month. My last two broke within the first and second month I will be leaving another review in 3 months explaining if they lasted or not and how they are doing. Now to kind of touch up on the waterproof aspect of these lights, I DID COVER EACH END OF THE LED STRIPS IN HOT GLUE TO PROTECT IT FROM WATER I RECOMMEND YOU DO THIS TOO. They say these are waterproof and I believe them but for an extra measure I added a little hot glue where each wire connects to an LED strip, and I feel it needed it. As for wiring, I chose to connect it straight to the battery and fuse I did not do the 12-volt cigarette lighter option because then you would have to go through the firewall. And I'm lazy. The wiring is very simple and the box has a pretty large range to connect to my phone's Bluetooth.Cons:- Pretty hard to install- Make sure you have places for the lights to go on your car.Granted one of the cons is because my car doesn't have a place on the rear fender for me to put the LED strip without it touching my exhaust. But I feel that this is an issue that a lot of cars will have, I ended up using zip ties and hanging them a little bit further up near the bottom of my trunk, But because the LEDs are so bright you can still see them and it worked out fine. As for the fact that it's hard to install, I've installed three, and this one was probably the hardest, But it was partly because I also wanted to make sure that they are going to last, routing them through the wheel wells under each plastic under belly pan and crevice I could possibly put the wire through. (If this is your first one and you are going to be installing it make sure you do not put it near any differential or axle or moving part of a cars suspension, springs etc) I strongly believe that depending on how you install them is how long they will last, I installed these pretty good hopefully they will last. A word of advice, TAKE YOUR TIME, DO THINGS RIGHT.... It took me almost 4 hours, But at least I know they're in there and not going anywhere. But it wasn't easy to say the least. I will be putting pictures up of the wires routed in the LEDs in a bit. As well as some nice pictures of my car with the LEDs on.AFTER TWO MONTHS:OK here it is, left side broke,  All of the led's including front middle rear did break, There was a few led's that's still seem to light up but they would stay lit even if I shut them off with the app.Now luckily for me and any other buyer they have amazing customer service, After contacting these people with the issue and sending them a picture of the issue they immediately sent a brand new replacement of all of the undergo lights.This is amazing, Not only will I be able to replace the ones that broke but now if another few break I'm going to have a full replacement strip for that side, It is a pain that I have to reinstall them but at least they sent me a new set and were not a pain. Hence why my 5 star review still stands.  I will  Install the new left led strip and give a 5 mounth review.Cool, so it's been a while, and they held up, I think this is a permanent solution for my lights problem, I took some pics and will attach them, I hope this review helped you decide.

 Let's get to it!! The install was a little tricky only because the installation may be dependent on the type of car you have. You either have to connect the hot wire to a fog light or head light fuse and the ground to the ground terminal on the battery. For me, my fog light fuse is connected to the ecu, so that was definitely a no go. The other option was to connect to through the lighter port and that's how I got it. I ran the wires under the car, then under the hood betwixt the battery, removed the rubber gasket that houses the wires inside the car, and ran the wires inside..got em connected and voila! The adhesive is ok, my suggestion is that you get your own or you can use the rubber brackets and screws. I've washed my car 3 times and driven it in rain and the adhesive held up pretty good. I fouled down on the adhesive..I'm happy with it!!!!

This is my second set in 4 months do to a car accident, my first set I loved because there were connectors between every light. It made installation a breeze on top of if 1 section was damaged you could buy a set and only have to change that 1 section. Just received my 2nd set and they are built different then the 1st set. The only disconnects are when you connect it to the power box, the lights on each side of the car are now long wires between all with no disconnect. I’m highly disappointed and am thinking of returning them to find some like my first set...

Bought these in November 2020 and installed in December. Have had these on my car for approximately two months and now one side of them quit working.Edit: Contacted the company and they issued a refund and provided me with a link to order a new head light strip set that works great. Great support even when you have issues.

Incredibly bright with many color changing options. Fairly easy to install, it directs you to screw the lights underneath your car, but I stuck to zip ties instead. I’ve gotten lots of compliments already! Would definitely recommend.

 I had these installed by professionals at car audio shop. They look great. I opted to use the cigarette lighter to power them so that I could use the built in power switch to turn them off during the day. Very happy with the kit. Get compliments all the time.

We had a friend install them because he has done them before and it went very easy because our vehicle had hardware already there for him to fix them to. We went to a drive through restaurant and the person waiting on us saw the underglow lights and loved loved loved them. He said they were so cool.

ZeroPlanet,4.0,2021 5 May,"
Great product but a bit tricky to put around the car. Every car is different so it’s hard to say it’s an easy install. Took me 3-4 hours to put on my Subaru BRZ since I have aftermarket side skirts and my underside was dirty so the double sided tape struggled to stay on even with me cleaning it.  The lights work really well and I love the rainbow effect I would buy again for another car if I wanted underglow. I made a video on YouTube in case anyone wants to see how they look at night and how the app works to control the lights. ( YouTube channel ZeroPlanet)

 Installation was a bit of a challenge.. You will need more 3M tape as a safety net.. Every now and again the lights will show white on the driver side now matter what color or pattern I have them set to.. Although I only typically use the red setting, there are a lot of different colorways to choose from and they are very bright.. You can even see them in the day when it's not too bright out. Love them!
"
Prince Dillian,5.0,2021 3 June,"
Hey there so I'm gonna give my complete honest opinion on these lights. First thing is they're really good, and a head turner! Me and my dad installed them under my 2017 optima in 5 hours it really did take a long time for us to get it done, but when it was done it held up perfectly, no issues whatsoever. Unfortunately the got cut and I no longer have them... I went to get a oil change and the bastards cut my light and I'm really sad because I really enjoyed the lights at night. I wish i could get them replaced or have the people who sold these to me to comment under here to help me out for this matter I literally had them for a month and lost them that fast because of a figgin oil change. Overall these lights are a must get!

I had this underglow for a almost a year now and I recently just had a trouble with one of the strips. I contacted the owner and they sent me a package right away! Their customer service is the best!These underglows are by far the best without being too expensive compared to other branded ones that PERFORMS the same but different ""flow sequence""I recommend getting this! Worth the money and time to enhance your cars appearance!

 I had a defective side out of the box. The company was very quick to respond and sent replacement parts immediately. It did appear to be a fluke or it was smashed in shipping, the rest of the kit has been great. The color options are preset but there are 100 or so to choose from. The colors are bright and vivid, the whole street is lit up under my non lifted golf cart and it looks amazing. Phone connectivity has been 100% reliable too, a issue I have had with others. Very happy customer.

I put almost 1000 miles a week on my truck, a lot of freeway driving, rain, plenty of dirt roads. I have these on almost all the time when the sun goes down. Haven’t had any issues with it so far. I wired it into my running lights rather than direct power. Hopefully they last so far no issues.

He drilled holes underneath and zipped tied it which is perfect because the adhesive would never last even my interior led lights the adhesive didn’t last but my exterior lights love them I can cut them on and off using the app!!!

Amar,5.0,2021 26 May,"
This kit is really good, I don't trust any adhesive but it also came with mounting hardware which i didn't use but seems sturdy enough, I zip tied the lights along the frame and subframe. The color effects are great, you can't see the individual leds plus the chasing  effect is seamless. Don't try to cheap out on those $60 kits trust me it's not worth it!
"
Dan,5.0,2021 26 March,"

"
David Jeffress,4.0,2020 1 March,"
I had the lights installed by a auto electrian so I would recommend that. It was connected to the battery with a switch mounted under the dash near the steering wheel. The lights work really well accept that at high brightness they flicker. Now I don't use them at that brightness so it is ok. If the front lights were disconnected then the flickering stopped. Othewise good quality product.
"

 Kit was super easy to install.  I'm a real Buyer that spent real money (even got the extended warranty just in case)  I did the install myself and I'm not all that handy. The 3m tape would be good if my moldings were smooth and clean, unfortunately mine are not.  So ended up using the clips, which I find keep the lights straighter IMO.  Anyways, I'm very pleased with the results and think they look great!  Very bright, app was easy to set up / use.  A dramatic change for an affordable price.

"
Omch,4.0,2022 12 July,"
Overall, I like the product and customer service is great!  But here’s my story:I had connectivity issues with the app at first. When I plugged it into the cig lighter the app connected without issues. Then I wired it to the battery with a switch and relay. The app didn’t work. I tried changing the fuse (started with a 15amp) and went up to 40amps and then the app came back online. It’s been 2 weeks and the app still connects so let’s see how that goes….The install is not bad but I wish there were more connectors to separate the front, middle and back strips when installing it. It would have been a lot easier like with some other brands. I also wish the led module/controller was further away from the front led strips so it could be easily mounted in the engine bay. It’s so close to the front strip that you have to almost mount it under the car. (In my case I had to extent the wire in order for it to mount in the engine bay the way I wanted it - maybe that’s why the app wouldn’t connect at first???)Other than that they look good and are bright.Would recommend to the seller to use real 3M tape. Korjo recommends their tape to be used for installing with the clips only, whiles other brands with real 3M tape say the tape is sufficient by itself to hold the strips in some areas.  But I would always use clips anyways.I ran out of mounting clips due to the excessive amount of clips that needed to be used on the strips and wires… but korjo customer service was able provide me more at no cost.  Now I have to wait for the clips to arrive (1 week) and re-Jack up the car to finish the job :/
"
dan kim,5.0,2021 3 November,"
I was quite hesitant on purchasing these lights but through the work I had to put in for the installation, it came our a lot better than I expected. They gave you a bag full of screws, zip ties and hold ons for the best protection. The 3M tape works wonders when the surface has been thoroughly cleaned. Unfortunately the 12v plug didn't work so I resorted to having to wire connectors into the fuse box which was a lot easier than it sounds. If you do purchase this item I suggest getting some inspiration by others on youtube to get you great results.
"
Jequar Campbell,1.0,2021 21 October,"
Finding power was the easy part… connecting to the app to try and find the Bluetooth connection took me more time than I thought everything would. I really wanted them hooked up so I spent 4hrs just trying to find & pair the Bluetooth… no luck & now I’m sending this crap back
"
Jason,5.0,2022 27 September,"
The lights are bright. Very straight forward install. The tape attached to the light strips is NOT meant to hold the lights on forever, it’s just meant to assist you while using the supplied clips to attach to the underside of your car

Justin Maloney,1.0,2022 11 July,"
Very good coverage, liked how it comes with 6 strips instead of the usual 4. No issues with wire length for placement and the mounting hardware is perfect, gives you piece of mind they won't randomly fall off as the adhesive is just to help with placement, not for long term use which is why they provide the proper hardware.Only issue is, it is one continuous wire with no connections. If you have to remove front or rear bumper the lights will have to be removed. I ordered the same waterproof connectors to solder in at the front and back so I can easily remove my bumper if needed.App is very easy to use and running power is easy if you have a test light to find switch power.5 star rating if they added more connections. Any car person will be removing their bumper at some point whether it is for repairs, ease of access or maybe you're too low and can't get your alignment without taking the bumper off to get on their lift. In any case, you will wish there was a connector to help with this process when the time comes.EDIT:One side of the vehicle has issues. The lights either won't work or if they start working the lights flicker and unable to hold a solid color. I only drive this vehicle in sunny weather and it the summer. Surprised they failed so quickly.

I have no way to of contacting ypu guys other then leaving a review. So once we can resolve this issue I will remove it and change it toA positive one.  So I bought two sets and only one of them work properly. I installed one one my truck and another on the girlfriends mustang. On her it doesn’t work properly. I have added a picture. The one rear section doesn’t change colour properly. It flickers and also stays mostly white.
"
Kevin,1.0,2022 20 June,"
The rear lights are now staying on 2 weeks after intall, they wont shut off and my son got pulled over by the cops and got a fine because they turned on during driving at night by themselves. I cant figure out how to contact seller as there should be warranty.... pretty pissed offSOOO the company sent me a new set of lights to fix up my boys car, he was pretty pumped. Put new set on, and within 3 months a set was toast again. No damage noticed, no wiring issue, nothing outta the norm can be seen. I will purchase a better set of lights and toss these in the garbage I guess.

Very happy with my purchase!I am 22, this took me maybe 3 hours to install with no tools honestly. It was so easy, the led strips are a perfect length, the wire fit nicely in the wheel well, I didn't have to take any covers off, and all wires are hidden! Connected the wires to the fuse box and battery. Bluetooth connect works well, I can have the lights on then connect to my cars Bluetooth to play music if I please. 120 options are very cool though lot seem very similar. App is easy to use as well. **My city had 2 days of rain a week after I installed them, left work driving home in streets flooded (so the entire under side of the car was exposed to water) and they stayed on right where I put them and still light up extremely bright**Definitely recommended!!

Sg,3.0,2022 13 October,"
I liked the sunglasses. But they arrived with one of the arms bent. I was using these sunglasses for an upcoming destination wedding and didn’t have time to return them. I was able to warm/heat the arm and hinge a little to make it more pliable to bend back in the correct position. They worked out fine but disappointed that the sunglasses were damaged before I got to utilize them. The seller really should consider sending a better durable case for sunglasses. It came with a pouch(soft) in a bubble envelope. Should be mailed in a hard plastic sunglass case or soy more durable to protect the sunglasses.

These glasses are pretty much as advertised with one exception -- the lenses are far darker than what's shown in the product information.  The ""blue"" is dark navy blue, not sky blue, and I had to really look for the peach tone at the bottom of the lenses.  I bought them for a little pastel tint to wear indoors for comfort after eye surgery, and these are full-on sunglasses, dark gradient lenses.

C. Thomas,2.0,2020 19 April,"
These sunnies are super cheap. Not inexpensive, but cheap. They would get 5 starts if I had purchased them at a gas station for 12 bucks. At more than triple the price they barely deserve 2 stars. If stores were open and I could get sunglasses somewhere else I would send these back in a heartbeat.Pros-can’t tell the poor quality from afar (no one will be able to tell you’re wearing junk)-blocks sun-comes with a caseCons-brassy, so cheap looking up close-flimsy and light. In less than a week of gentle wear, they feel loose and will not likely hold their shape (think wobbly arms)-poor grading on the lenses, way too dark at the high midpoint where you will be looking through them. The lovely rose tint is at the very bottom-not even a hint of scratch resistance-the price is laughable100% not worth even half the price.

Great buy, very cute glasses. Unfortunately mine were sent with scratches already on them 😕

Danielle Capelli,3.0,2021 28 January,"
The only complaint I  have about these glasses is that the lenses are not as big I  as I thought they were.  They’re cute and love the color but they’re a little small for my face which I  wasn’t expecting from looking at the pictures.
"
D.J. Clark,5.0,2021 28 December,"
Little right behind my ears but I adjusted them and they are fine.
"

Nobody,5.0,2021 9 September,"
Very cute. Doesn't protect completely but they are my everyday sunglasses. My came immediately out of the box with a scratch on the lens. But I just wanted them so i delt with it
"
Julia,4.0,2020 13 July,"
Sunglasses don’t look like the picture. I was expecting the gradient to be this color. They’re ok but it’s deceiving
"
Mary,4.0,2020 21 May,"
Literally just opened these and there’s only one nose pad 🙄Update: they’re exchanging them and made the process really easy. 😀
"
Kristi,3.0,2020 11 June,"
Honestly, they aren’t that bad, but I feel like I could have bought the same pair from Target or a gas station. For the price, these sunglasses suck. They’re cheap and get stuck in my hair. I guess one pro is that I’ve dropped them a lot and they haven’t gotten scratched!
"
Jessica Crawford,4.0,2020 7 June,"
Beautiful, but not as well made as I would have hoped, especially for how much they cost.
"
Kristy couture,4.0,2020 2 August,"
They are worth the money, stylish , love the rose gold
"
Jim Solomon,1.0,2022 2 August,"
Incredibly poorly made sunglasses. They lasted no time with the best of care. Would not buy them or any other Jessica Simpson product again for fear that everything under that brand would turn out the same.
"
Teri B,1.0,2022 17 August,"
For the price the quality is just not there. Also the packaging that it shipped out in im super surprised it didn’t show up in complete pieces. Did arrive bent

Glasses were flimsy and cheaply made….
"

The part of the glasses that hover over the nose of the human body is broken. I really loved the glasses but are unable to wear them now. 😕
"
Hannah,1.0,2022 7 September,"
Loved these glasses, but they broke after only two months when the side arm broke off the frame…disappointing.
"
Katy Wallace,5.0,2020 13 July,"
I was hesitant about buying aviators but this was the best sunglass purchase on whim. I’ve had them for almost a year and they have held up through three trips to Hawaii, a cruise and multiple jet skiing trips. I’m so impressed with the quality of these sunglasses.
"

Msdawn,1.0,2021 19 October,"
The first pair that I ordered was scratched on both lenses. I did a return and was sent a second pair. The second pair broke within two days. The screw kept coming out and when I would put it back in, the screw was stripped and wouldn’t ever tighten. I threw them out and won’t reorder. I’ve purchased these sunglasses from Belk years ago and they were wonderful. My guess is these are knock offs. Jessica Simpson products aren’t expensive so that makes it even worse
"
Racheal Ann,1.0,2022 25 May,"
Very cheaply made. Unable to tighten to fit my face. They arrived bent out of shape.  Fall off face if you look done the slightest bit.  Not worth the money.
"
MICHAEL BAGLEY,5.0,2020 25 June,"
Bought these for the Wife. Even though the lenses are not Polarized, they do advertise UV Protection. Wife Loves the look and fit...and She is Beautiful !!!
"
Thomas Oliver,1.0,2021 29 December,"
They have completely different lenses then the ones shown in the picture and as this is why my wife picked them out is because she loved the lenses that were shown in the picture so if you want some glasses with some ugly brown lenses and that my wife said were literally worse then the $7 ones she got at jc Penny's than these are the ones for you otherwise I'd recommend not getting these.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 25 March,"
I absolutely love these sunglasses!  Ordered a second pair!
"
Kc,2.0,2021 2 May,"
It looks cute but*sits heavy on the bridge of my nose*sits heavy because it’s too wide*clunky feel comes from the cheap way it was manufacturedI won’t return, I plan on giving away to charity. I’ll stick with the Oakleys.

Nathan Engler,2.0,2021 4 February,"
I bought the ""used-like new"" option. The one arm was bent, the lenses were VERY DIRTY. I guess thats the risk you take not buying the brand new ones, but never had a ""used-like new"" look like these did.... Yikes!

Rebecca Stephens,1.0,2021 29 September,"
Do not buy these.  They are terrible.  They quality of the materials they're made out of is junk.  They lost their shape in less than a week.  I take care of my sun glasses.  Normally, I buy expensive pairs.  This time I thought I'd try something new.  NOT worth it.  These are not worth a dime.
"
Sophea Hang,5.0,2021 20 March,"

Tara L. Tippery,1.0,2021 27 October,"
I'm really picky about sunglasses and these are the only ones I've been wearing for years so I just reorder it on Amazon every so often when it gets scratched up. I just ordered a new pair recently and it was all bent I couldn't even wear them so I had to throw them away.

Jenna,1.0,2021 29 September,"
These are not colored as pictures, they are just dark gray, very disappointing. They are also small compared to the description. I had ordered other pairs for a variety but I canceled after seeing that these are nothing special at all. The $10 sunglasses I got from Walmart are better than these.

"
Michelle Rickett,1.0,2020 29 April,"
The product was nothing like the photo. The photo showed colored lenses (which is what I was looking for) what I received was very plain black lenses and feels very cheaply made. Im now stuck with these because it will cost me money out of pocket to return. What a joke! This is the first negative review I've ever left, that's how disappointed I am in this product as well as the improper representation. I paid a little more than I had planned but got way less! I'm only giving 1 star because the shipping was fairly quick.

One of the arms became loose after about a month of use, causing the glasses to not sit properly on my face and flop around if I bent over while wearing them.  Look nice, but need better quality control.

"
Rory Lyons,1.0,2020 29 December,"
Hinges were busted and creaked when you opened them. One arm came out past center, the other was bent.They really should have been priced at half of what they were, based on build quality alone. These are $15 sunglasses, max.Jessica Simpson’s acting career has fared better than these sunglasses did.
"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2022 29 March,"
Opened package, and the sunglasses were completely twisted and bent.
"
Betty Usher,1.0,2020 1 June,"
I had a problem with the first pair of these that I ordered and returned it.  Now I am having the same issue with the 2nd. pair that a lens easily falls out and I can't get it back into place.  Now I have just missed the return date on this pair by one day and I am very unhappy with this product.

Showed up from Amazon in an envelope. Sunglasses are all bent out of shape right out of the cheap silver case they sat in. I’m afraid to adjust them to actually wear them as they’ll most likely break upon adjustment. Will definitely be sending them back. Don’t waste your money, nothing special for the asking price.

[Ordered this 2 years ago.]For the price, this case has held up extremely well. The way everything is made allows for little to no dust buildup, and to clean everything was fairly simple as removing just 2 major parts. Biggest issue is the front panel not coming off easily which is my biggest complaint due to dust being on the fans, but it's fairly easy to clean up from the inside.

Michelle Welch,5.0,2022 8 October,"
Can't say enough about this case. Has tons of room for alot of stuff. Everything is solid. Great metals used. Firm. No bending.One of the few cases that can fit a GPU up to 410mm long.

This is the second PC build I’ve done running a z590e rog strix and a i9 11900k with a ml 240 aio. And the temps stay around 65C if I push it I’ll only hit 73C. So for the price and your cooling combo, this case is worth consideration. Also RGB looks pretty cool inside and out with this.

Bryan C. Sanders,5.0,2022 16 August,"
This case is big. But it's the truth! Cooler Masters really lives up to their name with this one ""cool."" It looks cool, keeps the components cool, and I'm cool with that. See what I did there? But in all seriousness, it was very easy to build in and I love the way my build is white and black and the RGB makes it all the more better. This is a great case. I just wish they gave 16 rubber and 16 metal screw SSD/2.5 HDD mounting combos instead of just 8. You have four mounting points two up front and two in the back you have to make a choice which two vs. including enough for all four. Trying to find an additonal eight is a nightmare. But I'll live with it I guess.

NICE SOLID CASE ARGB  IS BEAUTIFUL  BUT NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR  CABLE MANAGEMENT  IN THE BACK OF CASE THE CASE CAN FIT A 360 AIO ON TOP IT A TIGHT SQUEEZE  BETWEEN  THE RAM  AND EXHAUST  FAN IN THE BACK  AND WIRE AT THE TOP MAKES IT VERY TIGHT.

Donald,5.0,2022 27 August,"
Was looking specifically for a white case to match the decor so that my son should learn to build his first gaming PC. Tons of room, numerous cable management anchors, and ability to mount fans on the front and/or top.Polygonal mesh design looks nice as well.When snapping the front back on, be sure to tape the power button flush with the fascia so that it fits atop the power switch beneath it.

Omar Tanguma,4.0,2022 20 May,"
My last case from a seven year old build was a Cooler Master HAF model which was also a mid tower but a complete beast of a case. This  current case is about the same price but you definitely don't get as much from a case as you once did. I'm sure the added cost is the RGB fans. Unboxing it felt a little flimsy but I like the front panel design. Once assembled it is gladly much more rigid. It is definitely a smaller case than what I'm used to and space is a little limited so keep in mind if you need extra expansion space like sound cards. or extra USB cards. The cord management bay is also a little tight but workable. I like the power supply shroud which can be used as a shelf to customize your build with miniature figures or whatever people decorate their PC with these days.The PS shroud also has mounting holes for SSD drives or they can be mounted hidden at cable management bay too.The glass is heavy and feels robust, the fans are quiet. I wish it included a rear 120 mm fan, but I added one back there, and added three 120 mm fans on the top panel using the various slots.All in all, it is a good looking case from a reputable brand that is better suited for a no-frills type of build. Internal volume is the only con here so far.

Jonah Hatt,5.0,2022 12 September,"
I was worried about getting a case that feels cheap or bends easily when searching for my first PC build. This case is excellent and feels very quality. I would highly recommend this case.
"
Hank,4.0,2022 3 September,"
it's a great tower and looks amazing.  But, the fan splitter that came with the case had one of the leads dead.  I had to use a separate splitter in order to get all three of the front fans to work correctly.

I wanted to get a white mid ATX tower to frame my PC build - my goal was to build a PC for a blend of work and mid-tier AAA gaming and this case fit the bill, esp when I bought it, the price was still right at $99.Here's my current setup:AMD Ryzen5 5600x (65W TDP)Zotac RTX3060 12GB TwinEdge OC GPU (170W TDP)G.Skillz TridentZ 2x8GB RAM 3200 MHz CL16MSI B550 Carbon Gaming Wifi MoBoWD Black SN750 500GB NVMe M.2 SSDEnermax AQUAfusion 240 AIO liquid coolerThermaltake 550W Bronze 80+ PSUCoolerMaster TD500 mid-ATX case24"" Lenovo QHD 1440p 75MHz LED monitorThe ATX case had to be white because IMHO, a white case reflects light better if you have components with aRGB LED lighting. I didn't want to use a whole lot of power, so my goal was a decent mid-tier rig that was energy efficient with a 550W PSU - so I wanted to go with the newest low TDP AMD CPU, the Ryzen 5 5600x with a GeForce RTX 3060 12GB GPU.Pros:1) The overall look of the case - white and the 3 stock aRGB fans that work seamlessly with MSI Mystic Light.2) The tinted tempered glass with the fractal edges is nice to look at.3) There is room to install a 2-fan 240mm AIO water-cooler on top.4) The magnetic flexible grille on the top is a nice touch.5) Two front USB 3.0 connectors.6) Already has three aRGB fans in the case! The stock fans are quiet and connected with my MSI mobo seamlessly and I control all three on three dedicated fan headers with smart variable fan speed based on CPU core temps.7) When gaming, I am able to maintain 56-57C CPU (steady state) core temp (haven't tried PBO2 overclock/undervolting yet) with slight GPU manual overclock 1950~2000Mhz on the RTX 3060 GPU @65 C max. This is with running the AIO water pump at 58% max speed with smart control at around 2000 RPM (max is 3400 RPM) and the radiator fans on smart PWM control. Standby mode is around 35C.Cons:1) I wish the front USB 3.0 cable connector was longer so it could be hidden better - to me it's a bit of an eyesore that this thick cable sits on top of the PSU bump-out and does a big U-turn to connect to the mobo.2) Two of the stock fans are screwed in, but the third fan on the bottom is plastic-welded in...what's up with that? Kinda sucks if you are looking to reposition fans.3) The dust filter for the PSU fan inlet at the bottom of the case is very flimsy and is easily knocked off if you are careless.4) It doesn't have a front USB-c connector.5) Part of it was my carelessness, but two of the PSU mount holes may have been slightly off-center which caused me to strip two screw holes for the PSU - oh well.

Jay Rocca,5.0,2022 10 August,"
Literally switched from a smaller case to this mid sized tower.It has a good amount of airflow, not too bulky, I put an rtx 3080ti in it, and there's still a lot of space at the front.The only thing that would make this even better is if there was bit more space for cable management, but then again, its not as if i took my time with the back panel cable management.

C. Okamuro,4.0,2020 17 July,"
I had an old Cooler Master Centurion 690 that I tried to re-use in a newer build.  The system consists of an X570 board, a 3900X, a GTX1080, and a GTX2060 Super.  Since it's a production box mainly used for compute, it's frequently at 100%, drawing 500 watts.  While the old Centurion technically worked, it needed too many fans (and made too much noise) to be practical.  The search was on for a newer high airflow case!  While I wanted to get a Phanteks case, I decided on the Cooler Master MasterBox TD500 Mesh Black ARGB (MCB-D500D-KGNN-S01) instead.  It came down to looks (subjective) and price.The TD500 arrived in a pretty beefy box, with no shipping damage.  I got my first good look at the front panel as I unboxed the case.  Well, if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I hope Fractal Design is REALLY flattered!  It's a pretty blatant copy, only marred by the ""Cooler Master"" badging (but, hey, it's their product).  The bezel on the front panel doesn't look nearly as nice as the mesh (which looks great).  The inner frame is pretty nice, staying out of the way for anything you want to do.  Sure, that's so you can pack the thing with exotic radiators and fans, but that's for a future build.  For THIS build, the PSU tucked neatly into the bottom tunnel.  The 8-pin was easy to route, EVEN WITH the motherboard in place.  The PCIe 6/8-pin power cables and 24-pin motherboard power connector route through the passthrough gaskets well.  The case jumpers come through the PSU tunnel passthroughs.  I found cable management to be pretty easy, even without a modular power supply.  The only bad thing, really, is the lack of gather points on the back side of the motherboard tray.  I don't really care about that, though.  You can see what the configuration looks like in my attached photos.  The beveled glass is a neat touch, but it's not really my style (although YMMV).  The worst case feature, from a practical standpoint, is the use of pins to mount the bottom front fan, though I guess they did that for clearance reasons.My main goal was to drop my component temps and noise level.  The TD500 did both quite well, without breaking the bank.  Excellent.  Eventually, I'll stick a massive radiator on the front and some fans on the top.  In the meantime, I'm still happy with my choice.  Recommended

This case was the easiest I've ever worked with. This case is on the larger side when many people want a tiny case. I have cerebral palsy so when building my PC I want room enough to eliminate the need for fine finger dexterity. Also this is a great case to teach PC building to someone with huge fingers the size of sausage links like my fatboy brother.The PC comes with 3 RGB fans preinstalled. The case has a space for a rear facing fan that I highly recommend you get to maximize airflow. Your GPU and CPU temps will love you for it. This PC has an interesting faceted front and glass window that add to the look of any PC you build here. There is ample space front and back, pass through's for efficient cable management if that is your thing. Or not!There is ample room for a healthy sized power supply and a standard ATX motherboard. The standoffs are already installed getting rid of that hassle. Ventilation in this case is extremely good. The power controls and USB's are ample and well designed. This case is a cut above most cheap cases so it is worth its slight premium price point. This is a basic or base line well built quality case. this case earns my 5 star rating.

Lucas Scholes,5.0,2021 7 March,"
I haven't upgraded my own case in about 6 years. It was about time, as I was upgrading my PC parts, and this really was the only case that STUCK out. That fractal design on the front and tempered glass look super nice, and a lot of reviews looked splendid.I honestly avoided most RGB cases, I didn't want to be all ""Flashy"" and have that ""Epic Gamer"" set up, I enjoyed my 2 separate fans up front, that just worked. no set up. but this case made setting up RGB on the reset switch on the front panel super easy. Plenty of different Motherboard adapters for the RGB controller as well, which come nicely labeled. Everything was already plugged in and set up to run off an adapter so I only needed to plug a single fan header in. SUPER convenient, as I was building 3 PC's that night, that was a total time saver, along with that adapter being labeled so neatly.This case was off to great start, It was super easy to work with, had everything I needed set up pretty much out of the box, and it looked pretty sick.I did have to look up a review online to see how to mount my SSD, as the case only came with screws and zip-ties, no manual, unless I missed it somewhere...But that's really minimal.The whole design is very sleek, and the inside is VERY spacious, My current parts a bit big, they took up most of my old case, as I have a asus ROG GTX 1080 ( 3 fans on this GPU, so she's a loooong boi) and I also have a Nocture D15S to cool my CPU, and that's a pretty sizable cooler, but it fits perfectly in this case, I still have plenty of wiggle room, if that's any idea of how much room you might have. I still have space in there.Plenty of spots for cable management with Zip-ties, or twist ties, whatever you use. Honestly really cleans up well back there.The air flow is TOP notch, with those 3 fans in the front, they do a really good job, my PC breathes VERY well with this case,  as there's just a lot of air flow.Honestly, the whole case felt very catered to my needs.Glad I purchased, and I hope if you buy, you feel the same! It's a really great case!Thanks Cooler Master!

CMV,5.0,2020 20 October,"
PROs:-Looks-Mesh front panel-Separate power supply bay-Lots of cable pass-throughs and grommets-Enough hardware included-Price vs similar designs-3x 120mm RGB + controller included-Felt sturdy and solid throughout for 'budget' case-Great cooling options-2 mounting options for up to 360mm radiator, could accommodate a 240mm + a 360mm at same time-will hold a long graphics card (9"" 2-fan pictured)CONS:-Only 2 front USB-HDD cage screwed and riveted - needs to be removable-SSD mounting grommet + pin is neat idea, but in practice cables make SSD pop out of place-Right/bottom side not nearly deep enough for cable management.  It's a real struggle requiring a 3rd or 4th hand to get the metal panel on properly.-PSU filter is clipped on junk & should be same magnet design topOVERALL: I'm happy and will call it 5* because of the features, looks, and price.  Was a pretty easy build but i used a semi-modular Seasonic 650W PSU that isn't very deep.  That left me a little room behind PSU for cable tucking and I only needed 1 modular run from it.  So getting everything installed and all the parts you can see prettied up wasn't difficult.  I like the offset channel top which made mounting the 360mm rad up top real easy too.  I experienced none of the issues I saw frequently in reviews like shipping damage or missing hardware.Biggest gripe/difficulty was the cable management.  Case gives great options to make the area you can see pretty.  Horrible options to hide/route/manage what you want hidden.  The permanently fixed HDD cage ""wall"" prevents excess PSU cables getting tucked there.  The overall cavity for dressing/tucking unused length of wire is very, very shallow and even the most minimal of cable runs and SSD connectors is pushing the back/right side of case making it difficult to close or easy to accidentally disconnect something like a RGB fan 3pin connection.  I used braided white extensions & combs just to look pretty.  But that meant I was in effect managing every bit of the PSU cables behind mobo tray and there simply isn't room to do that well.  About an inch deeper on the right side for routing cables would be perfect.  Usable as-is (obviously) but if you took both side panels off my build, you'd look at one side and say ""wow, how neatly built"" then look at the other side and say ""what happened?""

Kristofer Foster,4.0,2020 27 June,"
Moving to a new rig after 8 years on my current one, I wanted a few things:1) Rubber grommets for the different cords to go through and help it look clean2) Mesh front intake3) Full range of radiator supportThis case checks all of those very well for the most part. However, I use a CM ML360 rad for my Ryzen, ultimately putting the rad at the top (which is also mesh with a magnet screen over that that lays flush), but with the hoses at the back, I could not have a rear exhaust fan. No matter how low I placed the CM MF120 fan (same as come with the rad itself) it was just too thick at the top, closest to the hose. Slight bummer as I wanted the extra lights and flow. So far hasn't been an issue temperature-wise but still disappointing. Hope CM can either give a tiny bit more space in the case, height or depth wise, or even allow lower mounting points for the fan to fit at the rear, or make the rad a little less thick to allow more room.Front fans don't give that much light inside the case but still look nice thru the mesh front. Be aware the bottom fan is held in by plastic pins rather than screws and I have noticed the slightest of buzz/rattling from that (I think). NONE of them have rubber at the contact points to the case, I am getting the CM Halo white fans to replace them (not just for the rubber contact but I think they look better).Only other issue/complaint/suggestion is the PSU fan screen on the bottom is just a thin little sheet held in by a few tabs. It does not slide like other filters but is right where you want to grab the case underneath and then it falls out or could end up bent if you aren't paying attention. Would have liked to have seen a proper sliding screen like other cases have instead of a cheap solution of a mesh patch. Also, why aren't the PCI brackets in back white as well?Overall though I really like the look of this case. The grommets cover the cords well and are located at good heights. PSU shroud pass throughs are great too. Front panel looks really cool with the RGB and diamond design. Front I/O is simple and clean. Glass panel is simple yet unique and not distracting. Lot of airflow options with fans and AIO/loops. Just those couple of things with the PSU screen on the bottom, black brackets at the back, and the limited rear fan room are the only issues keeping it from a 5 star for me.

mikelsworld1974,3.0,2022 25 October,"
Very sturdy case. Not too heavy. Front fans stopped working after 1 week. I even put fan header on different pins on the MB. Funny thing is that the RGB stayed on even though the fans weren't spinning. It was very easy returning the case to Amazon.

I have a ryzen 9 5950x and a 3080TI in it and it runs cooler than my gtx1060 and i7 7700 build. The front is full mesh with 3 intakes and I didn’t even need to add any case fans my cpu cooler(scythe ninja 5) and the three front fans keep the whole thing icy and I have nothing to point at besides how open this case is. Excellent case and the lighting effects are gorgeous as well. Well done cooler master. You really seem to have mastered cooling
"
Chad C,3.0,2022 5 September,"
Was building a nice ARGB all white and RGB filled build, this was a reasonable case for the end product, with a couple corners cut for sure.The filter on top is garbage, it's magnetic, but the super this weak magnets are a joke as it falls off and slides. (Plus on a white case, why is it all black???)The ""filter"" on the bottom is a thin plastic mesh square. Probably 2¢ to make. But is a feature. LolThe glass is nice, but fingerprint prone.And the case itself is pretty nice, even if it's super light and I felt like I might bend it while installing components.One last thing is the basement the PSU sits in is only vented out the bottom, and is non removable without some tools.Overall it did the job, looks nice and is a good size.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 This case is absolutely gorgeous. The installation process was extremely easy. Cable management was perfect and the ARGB fans even included a controller which allowed me to plug the fans (ARGB header) to my motherboard that only provides PWM headers. So yes, as shown in video, this case works PERFECT with a motherboard only having PWM headers. I kept the 3 provided ARGB fans, installed a Vetroo V5 cpu cooler, and 2 Be Quiet! fans (one in back, one on top). The case is ridiculously quiet, granted i installed the Be Quiet! fans to balance out the provided fans. Airflow is great, no issues at all. If you like how this case looks aesthetically, there should be nothing holding you back. I could not recommend this case more. An absolutely amazing, gorgeous product.
"
Mouhamad,4.0,2022 24 June,"
The case is nice especially the mesh front. My 360mm aio just barely fit at the top, I didn't have room for the rear fan. Fair amount of room for cable management but no flat surfaces in the back to stick on my corsair commander. Good case overall
"
Jesse,5.0,2021 19 March,"
I really like the asthetics of TD500 Mesh, and while the front grille was practically stolen from Fractal, it does look good.  The default fans are decent enough and keep my 5900x around 40C at idle coupled with a Cooler Master 360 RGB water cooler.My biggest complaint about the case is the cable management behind the motherboard.  It is extremely cramped and I really wish it was 1/2 an inch deeper between the motherboard tray and the ""solid"" side panel.  If you are trying to use the included RGB controller as I did before fully rebuilding my PC (my old x99 Mobo did not have an rgb controller) you may need a 2nd person to get the side panel back on to the case.  For me it was a constant struggle, as the RGB controller forces a lot of additional wires behind the motherboard.  The side panel is much easier to put on without the hardware RGB controller installed, but it is still pretty tight.My case did not come with the exhaust fan, which I purchased separately.  It is a Cooler Master SickleFlow 120 ARGB fan, and it barely fits.  You can see in the picture that the radiator fans protrude below the exhaust fan, and the width clearance is about 1/8th in.  Thicker fans, like my old (but awesome) Deltas would not fit with on the exhaust mount with this cooler in place.While the radiator and exhaust fan are a tight squeeze, my 315mm XFX 5700xt THICC 3 Ultra fits with room to spare.Overall I do love the look of this case, and am satisfied now that it is complete.  However, the cabling behind the motherboard is cramped, and there are cases (Corsair 4000D airflows, for example) that offer more space to shove cables between the motherboard and case.  If you plan on using the RGB controller included with this case, prepare for a struggle.  If your motherboard supports it natively you will have a much easier time.

Only thing negative is the cable room for psu cables is pretty tight. If not using 3.5 inch drives you can remove the drive bays then this case its perfect wont find better for price.
"
SC,4.0,2020 26 August,"
I'm going to begin this review by simply stating I've dropped a star from my overall rating because of Cooler Master support.The case itself I like just fine. It's decently spacious. I was able to fit a Hyper 212 air cooler in it without issue (also CM,) which I was worried about initially because that thing is a bulky. I had read reviews previously that mentioned the side paneling wasn't actually tempered glass and/or flimsy--but that hasn't been my experience. It seems heavy, tough and I should probably remove the protective film off of it at this point (I'm the worst sometimes.)Building my PC in the case was relatively painless, and I do like the built in space towards the bottom for the PSU and HDs. All in all, I would like to review this case with five stars.However, that said, if you have any sort of ISSUE with your case--know that Cooler Master in my experience is anything but prompt in assisting.I.e. my case came with one of the three fans not lighting properly. It was spinning, so it wasn't necessarily the biggest deal, but like anyone I was hoping to get what I paid for and expected. Not wanting to tear down my entire new build because of one ARGB fan not lighting, I registered the case on CM's website and posted a support ticket to explain the situation and request if they would send me a new one.The reply didn't come until over a month later--where they agreed to do this--but simply asked for my shipping address (which, for what it's worth, was located in my CM profile and registration at that point.) Over another month later, I've now received a reply that a replacement fan has shipped (e-mail addressed to the wrong first name, but hey--as long as they've got the shipping address right...)All in all, a great case if yours arrives with no issues. I'm glad my issue was relatively minor and didn't keep me from actually using my new build. Worse comes to worse, dealing with Amazon support is probably going to be more fruitful than dealing with the manufacturer themselves, as prompt is not a word in their vocabulary.The case itself though? I like. Five stars if you get yours without issue.

Lee the Builder,4.0,2020 30 May,"
I received this case today May 30, 2020 for a build for my grandson.The cardboard outer box have a chunk damaged on one corner but the shipping Styrofoam protected the case which arrived pristine.The case is essentially complete as delivered. Separate in the box was the direction pamphlet, about two dozen sketches of various device installations and no written words. Also in the box I found both the magnetic filter that covers the case top and the small filter that covers the case bottom airway. I assume they were in place at shipping but got loose in transit. There is no fastener to hold them in place.In the case was a plastic bag. In it  a handful of black zip ties and the ARGB controller. In the bag also a couple of smaller bags of standoffs, screws and dowels etc., standard issue hardware extras.In the reviews a couple of confusing notes.It was stated that the clear side panel is acrylic. The manufacturer advertised is as crystalline glass. That is what it is. Earlier/ other versions of the TD500 do have a polymer panel, this one is etched tempered glass.A review complained that the hard drive tray was not removable. Partially true. The hard drive enclosure is also the PSU enclosure. It is riveted in place. Rivets could be defeated if a builder absolutely wanted to remove it but it looks like a structural reinforcement component of the case design. I wouldn't mess with it.On the other hand the riser that supports the trays opposite the enclosure tray support is removable by four screws. With that gone the trays come out and the enclosure becomes available for cable management or some freaky PSU arrangement. You lose 3.5 HDD trays but there's room for  SSD's elsewhere.We have not populated the case yet. My plan is to go all fans. Three came with, I bought one for exhaust on the case back, two exhaust for placement on the top,  there is a fan of course on the PSU, the GPU will provide three and the CPU will have two in push pull. Eleven fans in the enclosure hopefully arrayed to maximize flow.If noise is a problem or my grandson decides to go liquid cooling then this case offers ample room.I'll try to remember to update the review post build.

Henry,4.0,2021 20 June,"
This case came as a bundle with a CoolerMaster ML280 AIO water cooler.I bought a Gigabyte Z390 Gaming X motherboard and ran into problems with the size of the block plus fans not clearing the memory modules.  I removed the fans and mounted the block to the front panel.  Due to a raised metal stamping at the front of the case I could not mount the waterblock with the tubes at the bottom as should be proper. The raised metal kept the block from laying flat in that corner and misaligned the mounting holes.  I had to mount the block with the tubes at the top parallel to the pump which is considered non-optimal for pump longevity.Other than that this case is pretty nice.  The side panel is real tempered glass not just acrylic so be careful with that panel.  Two of the fans are mounted using the usual horribly tight fan screws that are tapped into plastic.  The last fan was held in with plastic clips that were actually good. When I moved all three fans though I had to purchase new mounting screws (or in this case I bought rubber mounts) to hold the fan to the back panel.  The plastic clips were not large enough to hold it in the pre-punched slots.Cable management is nice.  Lots of cable ties included and plenty of places to attach them.  I have a whole bag of extra ties I was given ages ago so I had plenty of spares.I like the case, but the water block plus the case were a minor headache to put together.Beware if using a waterblock to check clearance will be enough when using the block mounted to the top.

Overall, this case is very nice looking and has excellent airflow, and I am happy with it.However, it has one characteristic that I think everyone should know about (but many are not aware of):  It uses the ARGB standard (3-pin, 5V), not the RGB (4-pin, 12V) standard, for its fan lighting.What that means is:  If you (like me) happen to have a motherboard that supports RGB (but not ARGB), you will be unable to control your lighting effects via motherboard.  Instead, you will be limited to controlling your case fan lighting via a small physical controller device that comes with this case (that you can tuck away inside your case, or alternatively link with your reset switch so you can control it via the reset button on the front of your case).  But you will be limited to a relatively small number of lighting styles that can only be changed via physical button clicks, rather than infinitely customized via software.Interestingly, it seems that the ARGB standard is actually more modern (and flexible) than the RGB standard.  However, one should be aware that many motherboards only natively support the older RGB standard, rather than the newer ARGB standard.In case anybody is interested and has read this far:There are a very small number of ARGB-to-RGB converters (e.g., Razer and DeepCool) available on the market to resolve this compatibility problem, but they do not appear to be completely reliable and safe, so I may not use them.Alternatively, one can perhaps buy a separate controller that accepts ARGB and plugs into USB apparently.  (I'm still researching this.)However, bottom line:  For full software control of the ARGB fan lighting that comes with this case, be sure your motherboard natively supports the ARGB standard, rather than only the RGB standard.

 set up took some time but i was half awake after working a grave shift. otherwise it wouldve been a cake walk. the case is sturdy i was leary about the lines in the glass panel but its built real well. the mesh makes this thing breathe super well! i'd reccomend this to anyone who wants a good looking case thats also trying to keep they're temps under control just remember to order some extra fans as it only comes with the 3 in front. I slapped some antec P12s in there and it's definitely a happy camper

Was nervous that I wouldn't be able to top mount my Arctic liquid freezer ii 360 AIO due to the thickness of the rad and fans. However, I was able to pretty easily top mount it with Corsair lpx RAM on my Asus z690 plus mobo. There is still only maybe ~5mm or so of clearance so I wouldn't try it with anything much taller than the lpx in this case.

Once I had the 360mm radiator mounted on top, I could not line up the exhaust fan in the rear to it’s hole. So I had to ziptie it, but overall it worked out fine

The sent a new one in replace of it it took 2 weeks longer then when I originally ordered it.. however when the 2nd one came, it was in perfect condition. As for the case, it was very easy to build even for it being my first build ever. Keeps my 2060 running no where above 70 degrees Celsius when gaming, I only installed one additional exhaust fan, very happy with the purchase despite the lengthy wait.

Daniel,5.0,2020 16 August,"
This is an awesome case for the price. Got this to upgrade my build, I had an old, boring, smaller form factor case that I was tired of. This case is great for airflow, just look it up on youtube and a lot of videos are available where they've compared this case against others for their airflow/cooling capabilities.I removed all my parts and put them in this case. Installing everything was really easy, there is way more room in this case than a small form factor case. Only added difficulty was the additional wires for aRGB, I didn't have those in my old case. Lots of room for cable management in the back and the grommets and holes make that easier. The included RGB fans are nice, slightly whinier than my old Fractal Prisma SL-12 fans but not loud by any means. The tempered glass side is very nice, crystal clear and heavy. Mounting SSDs and HDDs is super easy, there are four spots to mount SSDs and they are simply held in place by little studs that screw in to the SSD and then you insert into rubber mounts. You can mount two HDDs in the drive bay with nifty little trays that slide in and out. If you don't have any old HDDs, you can remove the trays and the right wall of the bay and then you'll have way more room for the power supply and cables. The included ARGB controller is nice since I don't have an RGB header on my motherboard. For greater flexibility I was able to peel the reset switch cable away from the other front IO cables and plug it into the RGB controller. Now I can toggle through the 14 RGB presets by using the reset button on the front IO.

blake,5.0,2021 11 December,"
There really isn't much cons with this case. Looks nice with alot of standard options for cable management. The only issue i had(and it could have just been my case) was removing the harddrive bay. So one section is riveted on so you cant take that off, but the other section is screwed in which is removable. However it was ver very hard to get those screws off on my case for some reason. Either way i suggest you take it off if you dont plan on using standard HDD, cause it gives ALOT more room for cables.Also this fits the coolermaster ml360 mirror AIO cooler for reference. Kinda have to play with the front panel cables cause they make the 360mm radiator hard to work with but all in all wwas able to mount it on top with ease.You can also use the front panel reset switch on your controller instead so that you can control your ARGB fans by just hitting the reset button which i thought that was cool.
"
Matt,5.0,2021 9 August,"
For what you're paying this is a solid case considering you're also getting 3 argb fans along with it. Mine arrived in good shape unlike other reviews have mentioned. The case is fairly light while still feeling solidly built. The airflow of the case is great with all the mesh present on the case. It also looks great with all the lighting when running and really stands out. The design extending to the tempered glass is really cool as well and stands out from other cases with glass panels. The magnetic filter on the top is a nice touch but the PSU filter on the bottom feels like an afterthought. The ssd mounting options are clever and easy to use.The HDD cage being removable would be nice but at this price point isn't a deal breaker. The biggest downside as others have mentioned is that the cable management isn't the best. You don't have a lot of room under the PSU shroud for cable management especially if you are working with a non modular PSU. It's all still manageable and workable though and the front of the case that you can actually see looks great even if things are a bit cramped behind the scenes.Honestly this is a good case with a few small nitpicks that don't take away from the overall quality and value at this price point. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.
"
Joe P.,5.0,2022 12 April,"
I chose this case for the airflow. The fact that is has a very strong and beautiful glass side is fantastic.  The chance that it is white, now that is fortunate, since this was a gift for my 14 year old son.  He already has a nice white, rgb gaming keyboard, so it matches.  I have been building PCs for over 30 years so I know what I am saying when I say this.  It was easy to unpack utilize the space and plenty of fan places.  Everything fits perfect and airflow is maxed.
"
Keith Strickland,5.0,2020 27 August,"
This was my first home pc build so I went with a mid tower case after going through a multitude of reviews which steered me away from micro atx and landed on the Cooler Master MasterBox TD500.  Aesthetically the RBG fans are cool, and there's 3 of them which came pre-installed.  There's also interior lighting behind the motherboard which is neat.  The PSU sits at the bottom of the case with a vent and there's a mesh vent on top in addition to the opening in the rear.  I personally wanted a closed case and not open air simply b/c I fear dust so the tempered glass was ideal.  I can see everything inside and the components are completely enclosed.Given that this was my first build, I had no clue how much space I would actually need for the particular parts I ordered, but I was able to easily fit everything onto my mobo and slot it in with no issues.  Cable management was the only challenge as I struggled to route the 24-pin cable.  Other than that large bulky cable, the other connectors fit into all the available case holes to keep the cords hidden and clean with a tie.One thing I wish I had done is remove the hdd enclosure.  Now that m.2 is a thing, I would have preferred the space dedicated to the 3.5"" drives optional.  I couldn't figure out how to remove drive bays without completely taking apart the case.  Ideally, that would have freed up the entire lower portion of the case for cable management.I'll mention plenty of ports, usb 2.0, 3.2, DP, Wi-Fi, etc.  I'm digging the case and recommend.
"
CJ Adams,5.0,2020 29 October,"
My Review:As you read in the title, this case should cost way more. For the $100 price you get every creature comfort you will see on cases double the cost. It has a spacious PSU basement, removable drive trays because who needs HDDs when you can get ridiculously large M.2 drives and 2.5” drives nowadays, plenty of cable management space, and just all around next level looks. I bought this case first and foremost because it looked cool but when I fit my rig into it I was taken away by how low my temps were, my rig is running a Ryzen 7 2700x cpu and a Radeon RX5700XT gpu, all overclocked, and my temps are like 20 degrees cooler than with my other case just going off the standard air setup. This case is definitely worth the money and should be anybody’s go to when they need a quality case for an air cool build.Pros:- Great Temps- Great Looks- All The Creature Comforts- Ample Cable Management RoomCons:- Side Glass Panel is Not Tempered (the reason for this is so they can do the engraving you can see in the pictures)- Doesn’t Come With an Exhaust Fan at The BackFinal Thoughts:Overall, if the opening review or the title hasn’t hooked you then you must hate having a good PC case. This case is hands down the best case I have ever owned. I mean, it should be considered illegal to spend $200+ on PC cases when something like this exists that includes everything those cases have just with, admittedly, less of that glorious RGB.
"
killian,5.0,2022 14 May,"
The case has plenty of space for all your needs. With its 3 fans in the front and another one in the back (120mm) and one on top (120mm) it keeps my cpu and GPU in the low 40 degrees C. Easy to assemble with plent of options for cabling the Mobo is gigabyte and it controls the color scheme to the fans just fine.
"
Ghost,4.0,2020 10 September,"
Couple things right off the bat, the undercarriage power supply vent cover/filter is a bit flimsy, not magnetic like the top vent cover/filter.  I didn't realize this when I ordered the case, because I didn't care, but the clear side panel is legit glass which is kind of nice.  The case as a whole is fairly light which is also nice.  I had difficulties with power supply wiring once installed - there isn't much room once power supply is installed to add, remove, move cables around.  Plus tucking them around the back you run out of room pretty quick.  Not the easiest cable management I've done on a case, but manageable.Power button is a stiff button, not a soft spring press.  Reset button is very small.  Mounting a 240mm cooler on top was very easy.  I'd prefer more space from the top to the motherboard mount location, I struggled with the 240mm cooler on top to get the CPU power connectors on the board I put in this (no big deal though just do them first) but leaves you stuck if you ever have to remove them from dead power supply I will have to remove the fans from the cooler in order to remove them.  Also on the board I had, Fan connectors are also on the same side....so generally would like more space from the top to the motherboard...this would likely result in a taller case, but depends on where your trade off is.Power supply compartment is a little weird in that it's hard to show off power supply RGB regardless of how your position your power supply.
"
RO,4.0,2020 14 October,"
PROS:- great cooling performance- quiet fans- nice ARGB optionsCONS:- practically no cable management. very minimal space on the back of the case to route your cables and you really have to crush them in order to get the back panel on. the power cables to your 3.5"" drives are especially problematic and protrude far enough out that you have to bend them really hard to make enough room to get the panel on- the back panel is the usual terrible design that's really difficult to get on especially when your cables are going to be pushing up against them- the holes on the top for mounting a radiator of fans aren't recessed enough which causes the screws to make the removeable dust filter that lays on top sort of bulge out and not lay flat. if they made those screw holes even a millimeter or two deeper, it wouldn't be a problem- no front I/O adapter to make it easier to attach all connectors to the mobo at once. have to do each connector individually. this might be more on the manufacturer or the mobo than the case, but it'd still be a nice and inexpensive addition and make things a lot easier- no rubber grommets on the exterior. not a big deal, but would have made hot plugging drives or custom water cooling easier (or possible at all)overall this is a good case for the price point. it's just a bit cramped and might have made for a better full tower than a mid tower.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 13 May,"
This is definitely a great case, although it doesn’t fit my motherboard, it is a little bit larger than the room for the motherboard, asus tuf z590, if u don’t want troublesome and have the same motherboard as I do, maybe switch to another case. I fixed it with a hammer and it looks great!

Mark w,4.0,2021 3 January,"
Used this case for a build with an ASROCK B550m/AC motherboard, stock AMD cpu cooler, and three additional fans besides the 3 included in the case.The glass side great - seems pretty high quality and looks really cool with various rgb effects.I’m not sure about the included fans- they were very easy to set up with my motherboard because they came preassembled and plugged into both argb and pwm splitters that I plugged into headers on the mobo. The colors are consistent and work well with ASROCK polychrome sync. However, they don’t always spin on startup and sometimes I need to blow on them or initiate a fan test to get them spinning. That said, they’re quiet and also easily controllable with my mobo software.Prior to installing my 3 additional fans, my cpu was idling at around 55-60c. Now it hangs out around that same temperature under load, highly recommend at least 1 exhaust fan.Building in the case is easy, coming from a first time pc builder such as myself. Tons of room, included zip ties and hardware, lots of options for placing internal SSDs.Only complaint - My power button on the front panel snapped off with the first press. It’s held on via its frame and two tiny plastic pegs with some kind of adhesive to the front panel. It was a super easy fix - I used some rubber cement on the pegs and it works like new.
"
Kit,5.0,2020 15 September,"
This was the case I choose for my first PC build and I absolutely love it so far. Mine arrived in perfect condition and I have not had any issues with the stock fans making weird noises, like other reviews have mentioned, but I'll update this if anything changes.Anyway, this thing looks amazing. Super sleek and very well-suited for an all-black gaming build. Plenty of room for more fans (I added three of CM's halo 120s) so everything has been sufficiently cool so far (idles around 35-40 and gpu runs at a cool 65 even for heavy load gaming).You can remove the slots for the hard drive bays, which is nice and helps for getting your cables in on the psu, although your best bet is hooking your psu cables up before actually installing it. With it installed, the angle was too weird and difficult to make work plugging stuff in, but again. Just doing that before screwing it in fixes that tiny issue perfectly.Also, the tempered glass (and yes, it is tempered glass if you get the cheaper mesh option on this listing) is veeeeery pretty and I love the cuts on it, really makes the rgb look even more visually interesting.I may replace the stock fans at some point but so far they do the job and they're very quiet! (Although the ambient noise is pretty loud in my house to begin with, so idk).Anyway, great case!
"
Johan,5.0,2020 15 October,"
Building in this case was absolutely no stress, there is so much room for cable management as the PSU shroud doesn't extend to the fans. The hard drive mounts (have no idea what they're called but hopefully you know what I mean) are removable as they are attached to the shroud and bottom of the case (held by 4 screws).Pros:-Spacious, using 3 NF-F12(120mm) from Noctua on the top of the case with a fair bit of wiggle room remaining. Can stick some front I/O cables that I find redundant like the USB 3.0 in the hard drive compartment.-Looks very nice although that is subjective-MB standoffs are pre mounted-Tons of cut outs for zip ties and velco straps which could be used for cable management.Cons:-Hilariously cheap PSU dust filter. I mean, a thin piece of napkin could be competition for that filter-Not a lot of fans but at this price point, you could easily find cases with up to 6 fans like the Musetex Phantom Black. This case doesn't even have an exhaust fan as you can obviously see however, most case fans pale in comparison to aftermarket case fans in terms of airflow anyway and are only there for aesthetic effects.Edit!!: There is a weird clicking noise with the front rgb fans regardless of whether or not you turn the rgb off. It isn't audible with a headset on but it's a good to know
"
Yurika,4.0,2021 9 February,"
Apparently the RGB fans that come with this case cannot be controlled by software unless you have a motheboard with ARGB 3 pins. My mobo unfortunately has JRGB 4 pins and so the only way to control the colors is via the little remote that comes with the case but sadly you can only pick from a few presets that come programmed in it (aka I wanted a solid purple/pink color but had to settle on purple/pink breathing style.)I downgraded from a really great corsair case but I just needed more space so I opted for a mid tower but design wise I really like it. The front 3 fans are quiet and if they aren't, install your motherboard's software to help control them as I have learned. I installed a back fan and installed 3 more fans to place up top for more cooling.Only other thing I hate is opening/closing the back case is very difficult if you do it while the computer's vertical. Have to basically place it on its side otherwise trying to lineup the holes with the closing panel is really annoying. Anyway I'm still happy with the case, I bought it mostly for the design/looks and to downsize from my full tower.
"
Suzanne Rogers,4.0,2020 15 September,"
Let's start with the positives:Great airflow, nice cable grommets to keep stuff clean, the fans that come with it are stellar. Easy to work with. ARGB works well, and provided splitters are handy.The small negatives: Space in back of case is big enough, but with full ARGB makes the back a squeeze once all cables are routed. Not enough screws provided for extra case fans. I've read that the front fans were all supposed to be attached with plastic bolts, but only 1 out of the 3 of them were permanently attached so that was a pleasant surprise. This is all to lead to my main gripe regarding radiators: if a radiator is top mounted with a 360mm sized radiator (and probably a 240mm) it will collide with your ram if the ram if you have a ram height of 44mm so they will not fit together. I was able to mount the rad to the front with the provided long screws in Cooler Master's 360 mm aio, but could not attach all 12 because the bottom fan was plastic bolted on. I ended up using a command strip to keep it tight near the bottom of the case, but am just peeved at the accessibility of the front fans.All said and done, it was a good build and I'm happy with the looks and 30 degree temps on my 10th gen processor.
"
Matthew Waters,5.0,2022 2 May,"
I really like this tower as it is very well thought out and looks gorgeous, but if you try to use a 360mm cooler master radiator along the top, be warned- it doesn't leave much space between your RAM and your fans if you have tall RAM sticks. It'll work, but barely.
"
Franco M.,5.0,2022 2 May,"
This is simply a great case. It looks fantastic, it has a lot of space (maybe too much if you're looking to go small), and 3 preinstalled front fans. By the way, the HDD space can be adjusted at first to adjust the power cables first which is just some genius engineering.
"
MJ,5.0,2021 14 July,"
If you're looking to put together a PC with a white color scheme, this is the case you want.The textured front mesh with the RGB fans behind it is gorgeous, and the etched pattern on the side panel window gives it a bit more personality without being tacky. I like the PSU cutout so that you can show off your high-end power supply but still hide all your messy cables. The illuminated power button in the shape of the CM logo is also a nice touch.Dust buildup in the five months I've been using this case has been minimal. It's also pretty easy to build in, though don't expect to get to anything near the top of your motherboard without removing any radiators you've top-mounted.The only real gripe I have is that the mounts for the two SSDs above the power supply are positioned such that you'll probably have a VERY tight fit for the SATA cables. It can be done, though, with some patience.Very good value for money, and high-quality materials. I can't think of a single white case on the market I'd rather have at this price point.

Well I really am impressed with the thermal performance of this case and it looks really nice with my setup. The only complaints I really have are it is a ""Dust Magnet"" be prepared to give it a good clean it at least once a month if not bi-weekly. My only other complaint is that the pre installed RGB controller only has Flashing RGB not any solid color options you can have it set to a specific color however it will fade to black and then a very bright iteration of the color of your choice. its ither that or unicorn puke so I decided to turn it off completely. I have no clue why they included this trash RGB controller even though they have a nearly perfect controller that comes with many of Cooler Master's RGB CPU coolers.

 So the case is great, has plenty of space, and plenty of airflow. The only minor flaw that I saw in the design was when installing the graphics card, the space to fit a screwdriver is very narrow that it can be easy to strip the screw. Other than that its a really good case that'll keep your pc cool.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2021 23 January,"
The case is made well, however the metal can easily be bent. Other cons incude a terrible PSU mesh filter that continuously pops off, A LOT of cables on the stock fans for power and RGB. Lastly, very limited space between the back of the case and removable side panel for cable management. I often need an extra set of hands just to attach the side panel that is pressing against my cable management. From a trusting brand, I would expect maybe a slide out filter rather than small notches that don't hold it in place.Bedsides these gripes that I've experienced the white is an amazing choice, the glass design flows nicely with the front fan panel. This thing will SUCK so much air if you did what I did and placed a 360 Corsair H150I at the top with LL 120mm fans and 3 Corsair LL 120mm fans in the front. You cannot adjust the fan speed with the stock fans and the RGB on them are sub par. This was my forst build and the case offers plenty of space and nice rubber shrouds to feed cables through. Would recommend.

I'm using this case for my first build, and I do have to say that it is beautiful. However, much to my dismay, it is *ever* so slightly short to fit a top-mounted AIO.I'm using the Cooler Master ML240L and the fans *just barely* don't clear the RAM sticks. I had to take a dremel to the fan shroud in order for the RAM to fit and be seated properly.I'm a little worries that the 1mm gap between the fan blades and the RAM isn't going to be enough. I will continue the build as normal and update this review if my modification worked.

T-H,3.0,2020 21 November,"
the Side panel was an afterthought. Not only did it stick out from the case you could see each fold and detail on the case since the panel was just simple glass no metal frame no nothing.while the Airflow was good the top mesh moves FAR too easily when picking up the case the mesh slid around as i went to tilt it back. this is with an Empty case. nothing in it. another factor to consider, why is there mesh up here?top fans and Rads should be EXHAUST ONLY heat rises and convection means heat will WANT to flow up creating its own airflow as the air expands. Exhausting air through this Point means better cooling. you are working with the natural airflow. mesh up top does what? it cant filter as this is an exit point. there is nothing to catch assuming your intake filters are working. this means this Mesh is ONLY restricting airflow for NO reason. lots of cases have fallen into this.  bottom and front should be intake Rear and top exhaust for a standard case design (there are a few Exceptions!)that being said. for an Air-cooled build. this case does ALOT right. meshed front with big intake space. Basement is Big enough to house bays. which one can remove. the case can easily fit a 35mm 360 rad in front and a 280 up topits a good case to work in for the most partFinal thoughtsthe glass panel should recess to be flush with the case end not stick out.the Mesh top should be Changed out for a more open less filtery option thats built into the case as the front fans should be doing that work anywaysthe Build quality leaves something to be desired. compared to the 4000D airflow this case feels cheep, light and Plasticky the Angled glass designs feel gimmicky.  you are mostly Paying for the Fans. Id bet of the cost $40-50 of it are in those fans.

Overall a very good case, easy to install, good amount of space for cable management.However, the nail on my metal plate near IO shield part popped out, so I used force to push my motherboard in there and put the stand-offs in, which could be really bad.Also the top can indeed fill 2x 140mm fans, but a 280mm radiators won’t fit because the ram spot blocks the radiator.

Jake,4.0,2021 29 March,"
I've got a 3080 packed in here and the power PCIE cables are just barely pressed up against the glass. After all the cables I need plugged in and nicely tucked in the back, putting the back plate back on was a little bit of a struggle. Overall aesthetic is very very clean, building inside was really easy. I feel the main Con is cable space in the back. If I wanted to put in Colorful power extensions I don't think Id have enough room in the back and they would have to flow into the viewable part of the case. However for a Mid-Tower.... Grade A quality airflow, comes with 3 super silent ARGB Fans that have been very effective for me in my build.Since I have a large GPU and I may upgrade to a Full Tower for just a bit more room for fun activities and possible water-cooling.Over all its a great case none the less.

love the way the case looks and feels. Top rad. support is amazing where you can push it back or forward depending on your ram clearance. Cable management is pretty good for the most par. Only complaints I have about it is that the fans rgb somehow don't work, but still spin normally. Don't know why that is, I plugged everything in troubleshot everything to see if I had done something wrong, but unfortunately the ARGB fans don't have RGB. Also, the empty space at the bottom of the case where the Psu and the hard drive cage are located I had to take the hard drive cage out because i wouldn't have had enough space for cable managment. So unfortunately I couldn't use my hard drive, but it's all good because I'm going to get ssds and M.2 ssds. As far as the stock fans I was going to replace them anyways so I guess it's a win win? Just kinda sucks that the stock fans didn't have functioning RGB.

The 3.5"" drive cage is too close to the power supply mounting spot, it is difficult to get either power supply that I have to put in there installed without removing it. I will be cutting the rivets that mount the drive cage in and removing it. It also blocks access for a screwdriver to screw in the bottom front fan, which is why they put plastic fasteners to mount it. If you remove them, you are not likely going to get them back in. The drive cage should have been removable, a lot of people aren't even using 3.5"" drives these days. If the drive bay was removable or the case was about 3"" longer, it wouldn't have been a problem.Even after modding the case to remove the drive bay that was in the way, I had planned to watercool using 2x 240mm EKWB coolstream SE rads, this plan fell through because there is not enough clearance at the top of the case above the motherboard for a radiator and fans. This forced me to use a 360mm rad in the front as a single 240 wasn't going to cut it for a 2080Ti and an i7-12700k. I should have just bought another O11 dynamic XL. I've been building computers for 18 years and this case has been the most frustrating to build in that I've ever used.Update: the 360mm rad and pump wasn't going to fit with the 2080Ti. This case is utterly for water cooling. Get an O11 dynamic, they are much better all around.

Amazing case overall. It was honestly a pleasant experience working with said case, as it's very sturdy, stylish and easy to work with. The fans provide pretty decent airflow and the argb lighting is honestly pretty nice, plus the rgb controller is a plus. Honestly if you find it at $100 it's almost a must buy in my opinion.The drawbacks however are the following, due to having a mesh grille, this makes it a dust magnet. Get used to giving the case a constant cleanup inside and outside. Another nit-pick that bothered me is the proprietary cable used for the argb fan leds, meaning that if you want full control of your fans you have to buy a separate cable to replace the one it comes with. it isn't a deal breaker but it leaves a sour taste. Apart from those drawbacks, this case is a great buy for both usefulness and design.

This case has everything lined up correct for assembly. I didn't have to adjust anything. The quality is great and there were no defects. The 3 fans work great to cool the components. I may still get a gpu cooler but I haven't been thermal throttling with this case yet, so I'll wait a little while. The power button is a little flimsy for my liking. All the fan mounts are slotted for maximum versatility. I wish it came with fans on the top and back as well. ( Mine aren't as powerful as the ones that came pre installed ) This is a great case.

Benjamin Heinisch,5.0,2020 9 November,"
Note that my experience with this case was transferring from a Corsair Carbide 100R, a cheaper and much flimsier case.Overall really impressed. Feels very sturdy but also doesn't weigh a ton, cable management is good with plenty of tie down points for zip ties or cable ties. Fans are nice and quiet and seem to do a good job of keeping my system cool (Ryzen 5 3600 with Hyper 212 RGB Cooler, MSI Armor RTX 2070). I really like the grooves etched in the tempered glass panel, adds a little bit of flair that other cases were lacking for me and I feel it helps it stand out from the rest. The only complaint that I do have with it (and it is a small one) is that the power supply window is a little too short to display the entire label on my power supply (Corsair RM750X) but that really doesn't bother me all that much. Overall very happy.

Amazon Customer,4.0,2020 24 August,"
I was really excited for this case.. i changes from my fractal meshify c to this. Fans are nice. I love the glass panel. The metal side panel, i hate that thing. My psu holder came bent. Baffles me as it that back corner is in styrofoam.. so it was damaged BEFORE packaging... have better quality control please, I should not have to bend things back into place and then have to screw it in for it to be less bent as well. The PSU filter is pathetic. My previous fractal wins in quality by far. But its still a great case and pretty roomy. I had high expectations for the case and i was let down a little but im still mildly satisfied. I hoped for better. For 99 bucks id still take my meshify c(which i paid 85 for 2 years ago) over this. I needed the extra space though as my 1080ti and 280mm aio didnt play nice in the meshify.

Peter ,5.0,2020 4 November,"
it's a great airflow case for 100 bucks. I used this case for my old 4790k and 780ti pc I built back in 2014. it's a definite upgrade from my cheap diypc case I bought back then. some might not like the crystal look but I think it looks good and makes it a little bit more unique. the rgb fans work ok idk if they are the best fans for pushing air so you probably want to upgrade those fans in the future to make use of the ""airflow"" aspect of the case. also be careful not to lose the bottom dust filter for the power supply because it likes to pop out every once in a while. last thing is that it's a bit of a squeeze back by the power supply to connect your cables. tooke a little bit to make everything not too bunched up and connected but it's doable.
"
Ryan,5.0,2021 30 December,"
Great case for a beginner has plenty of room for further upgrades. My concern is that that packaging is only foam and my case was delivered cracked. Its a small Crack underneath the front panel that's is luckily hidden from view. I would have returned it if I had the time to wait, but it was a bargain to get.

 This case was easy to build in. RGB fusion is trash but it did control the case fans without too much difficulty. Also make sure to check your PSU length, as I had to remove the side of the HDD cage closest to the rear and then attach all of the modular cables before sliding the PSU in, and routing these cables through the back was difficult due primarily to the fact that they were all bunched up coming out of the side of the HDD cage, though the cable tie down points made it somewhat easier to route them and keep them low profile.The case fans seem to move a lot of air and I cannot hear anything outside of the case. Coupled with sticks of RGB Vengeance Pro, it looks quite nice!
"
john paul,4.0,2020 7 November,"
Weird periodic noises coming from my PC. It runs silently but then there would be this loud buzzing noise that lasts for a bit. Could be a loose part somewhere on my end but I've checked everything and I have a feeling it's the case. Otherwise, very cool and very airy. Quality of material is okay too good, but not great. The bottom filter is cheaply made and not magnetic like at the top of the case. Lots of area for upgrades. Remote to control front panel rgb fans are going to be inside unless you figure out how to put the remote outside of the case while still connected to the inside parts. The front where you can see the PSU is kind of awkward though. Can't really see the name of the PSU completely.
"
Ryan Redecker,5.0,2021 21 April,"
Case is fairly easy to work in. Pre-installed fans leave a lot to be desired but I was going to remove them to have all matching fans anyways. They used plastic braces to hold the bottom pre-installed fan in instead of screws which makes it a pain to remove and the location of the hard-drive/power supply bay makes it a little hard to get a third fan screwed in without disassembly but not impossible.In all its a nice case only really have minor issues definitely should be used with an NVME storage cuz other storage options aren't convenient, SSD mounting locations are blocked if MB or Power supply is already installed, and frankly you need to remove the HDD bay for cable management.

Dana B.,5.0,2020 4 November,"
Once you've been building computers for a while you start to appreciate simple things that just work. I am a person who enjoys performance over having the fanciest gadgets and this case does deliver. Added some fans at the top and one at the rear and this puppy is staying cool with no water cooling solutions. Really the only complaint I can make is that the cable management set up in the back isn't the best, not bad mind you, but at 100 dollars you really can't complain IMO. There is plenty of room for those who might decide to do a custom water loop solution. Great case, great value, the only tips I would give is to get a fan for the rear and if you can, 2 at the top for a great airflow solution.
"
Nathan,4.0,2021 15 June,"
Like the title says, the case looks great. Very clean looking and the lights are awesome to look at. Fits my 1080ti no issue, but feel like with it and an i10 processor it runs just a little hot in a tight space. I attempted to put a standard 360mm radiator w/ fans on the top for the CPU, but the way it's spaced leaves the case fractions of an inch too short for the center fan to fit, with it bumping into the RAM

mike,5.0,2021 15 April,"
This is the first case ive ever purchased & I have nothing bad to say about it.I like how there are ways to easily manage cords within this case.I like how it had 3 fans already installed on the front.I love the dust protection screens on the front, top and bottom where the battery is. Though the one on the bottom didn't have magnets to make it stay in place like the top one does. but its fine.The glass side can be taken off and on very easily.Overall its a 4.9would have been a 5 if that bottom screen had a better way to stay in place.but seriously its not very important..
"
Hung Pui,4.0,2021 20 May,"
Very happy with this case, however there is a portion that appears to be an area for two slot height vertical GPU mounting that is just a dummy spot that has vents and is not capable of using in this manner without heavy modification. While this feature was not advertised, it's reminiscent to jean or jacket pockets that are sewn shut. Just make the area functional please! Otherwise the case is very easy to use and we'll equipped. Added my own 120mm fans on the top for venting.
"
Lazlo US,4.0,2021 20 April,"
This is probably one of the easiest cases I have working in for a while. Plenty of space for installation and plenty of room for any kind of AIO. Not to mention the system for removing the glass side panel that keeps it from falling off as you’re removing it. The only downside is that for me to have enough room to hide my cable, the 3.5in hard drive cage was removed. Not really too much of an issue if you aren’t using 3.5in drives because there’s plenty of options to mount 2.5in drives all over the case.

My build: ASRock Z490 Taichi (10700k), CM ML360RGB AIO, G.Skill TridentZ RGB RAM, Seasonic Focus PSUOverall this case was really easy to build into and looks nice.  The large side window provides both quick access and full view of the internals.  Wish there was a USB 3.2 Gen 2 port on the front instead of only Gen 1s, also as others have mentioned the PSU/HD compartment at the bottom is a little clunky.The built-in fans are okay (3 pin) though they seem to stall if powered less than 100%, so you'll have to decide when you want them to come roaring on.  Their aRGB connection plugged-in directly and worked seamlessly with my motherboard's header and software.
"
Michael H,4.0,2021 9 January,"
The case is well designed and easy to work with.  There's a good amount of space on the backside for cable management and I did not come across any sharp edges.  The biggest problem I have is the noise from the fans.  All three of the included fans make a buzzing/humming noise that I can hear through my headphones.  It's not egregiously loud but I expected much better from case fans that are $20-$25 a piece.  A quick search in the reviews and the rest of the internet shows that this is a common problem that has been going on for at least half a year.
"
Arn,5.0,2021 30 January,"
This is an awesome case! Amazing airflow, and great looking as well. I’d recommend it to anyone that is looking for a good looking white case and if air flow matters to you. The only thing I wish the back panel was easier to attach. Can be annoying to put back on after wire managing.Edit: I have to knock it one star because of the rgb on the fans. Not the best lighting quality and limited lighting effects on them. All I’m all it’s a good case if you want to not spend so much money on a case with good features. I recommend buying an extra 120mm for the rear. I plan on replacing these fans
"
Matt S.,5.0,2021 28 January,"
Very well designed case. Has a few extras that other cases in that price point don't have such as: ARGB and PWM fan cable splitters, more tie-down hooks for cable management, and support for top-mounted AIOs as well as front and rear. The only down side is the tempered glass side panel is lacking sound dampening (i.e. some type of cushioning), but with today's fan management it's not loud enough to rattle the glass anyway even at full fan power. The only extra I added was a rear exhaust fan, but I didn't actually test it with just the stock fans, so it may not /actually/ be needed. Great case for the money.
"
Loken,5.0,2020 21 December,"
I will put it this way:The case looks fine, utilities were fineThe case fans became audible after one or two months of using so I replaced them with noxtua fans so that's another 140 bucks spentBut it was still alright, until this MF started shaking with the hhd I installed on the storage bracket. At first I thought it was the problem with my hhd so I bought a brand new Seagate one which clear didn't help then I had to lay some soft material underneath the drive to make it less noisyIt's generally an unpleasant experience, next time I would go with fractal design, their build quality is much better trust.
"
Zachary Nolt,5.0,2021 23 February,"
This is a great case for people wanting to build their own computer! The case has a nice power cord shroud to hide the wires in and lots of space for everything you need. Overall the build quality is good the bottom dust catcher is a little annoying since it's a cut out of mesh and easily falls out when moving the computer around and the back panel can be a chore to get on once all the cords are run. The case looks sharp and allows my computer to breathe and does a good job of looking sleek when finished. (Will try to remember to post pictures of it)
"
Chris,5.0,2021 7 January,"
This case is a perfect case for a mid-tower build. I have a 240mm AIO mounted in the front behind the case fans with a single exhaust fan in the rear, and I've never had better temps inside a case. The mesh front allows pretty much the maximum intake and the entire top and rear of the case being cage makes for a great positive pressure keeping dust out of the case. The fans on the front are borderline silent with some pretty cool preset ARGB color options, but a software controller would be much better than opening the case to change the colors. I cannot recommend any other case more than this one
"
T. Gaunt,4.0,2020 15 September,"
I received the first one with a chipped glass panel.  This is plate glass, heavy, and ok, so that can happen with shipping sometimes.  I thought I'd avoid the easy Amazon return and save some planet by asking CoolerMaster to send me a new glass panel.  But the Cooler Master support team NEVER responded to my ticket.  After a week, I gave up on Cooler master support, and just did the quick easy Amazon return.A new one came with good glass, and we really enjoy the look and the ease of use.  Would totally recommend the unit, but I'm slightly suspicious about Cooler Master's support response in the future.

Pros:TONS of airflow, 7 120mm fan mounts mean lots of cooling.Matte finish looks amazing in white.Angled styling and crystalline glass cut a striking image when paired with RGB.Tons of room for cable management, and nice clean grommets.Cons:Basement is not the full length of the case...but it would prevent a 360mm radiator in the front. Not quite sure if this is a con yet but since I don’t use a radiator I’m not convinced I like it.Drive bay frame is not removable without a fair bit of hassle. This was only a minor inconvenience, but an inconvenience nonetheless.All in all I am very happy with the case, and my monochromatic build looks absolutely gorgeous.
"
Paige Suckow,2.0,2020 11 November,"
Don't buy this case if you are looking for proper cooling! The first case that I bought off of Amazon had strong fans that got weaker in the span of a week. The ARGB only lit up twice before dying completely in that same week. Amazon was great at trying to help out with these issues, so nothing against them. Cooler Master however has absolutely horrible customer service. Their customer service gave me the run around for almost a month while constantly blaming components such as my Corsair RM 750X PSU, my ASUS TUF B550M-Plus (Wi-Fi) motherboard, my AMD Ryzen 7 3700x CPU and included Wraith Prism cooler or blaming me for not plugging things in correctly. Cooler Master absolutely refused to admit that their product was faulty and asked me to test the fans individually. The lovely people at amazon shipped me a brand new case that is identical to my first one. The fans are an okay strength and the ARGB works with this one. I am severely dissatisfied and constantly worried about my components now. Lately when I have been doing nothing except for running fan Xpert 2, I have been seeing CPU package temps in the 130 degree F to 164 degree F range. I had to buy three completely separate cpu fans and install them in my case to hopefully keep the temps inside the case from cooking my components. I have no idea why this one tower case is higher on the list than other cases that have airflow as a first priority. The instructions are a bunch of pictures than can be confusing to figure things out with when installing the motherboard or other essential computer parts. Save your money and get a different case. Corsair sells a 220 T tower case that is made out of steel and has a glass side panel for the same price.

 Side panel and front panel looks amazing. Got room for RGB strips on the front of you want more lightsWish the shroud extended all the way to the front of the case.If you want to add 140mm to the front I suggest making new mounting holes because they are currently see to be placed at the very bottom and halfway on the middle openings. Top fans don't leave any room for rbg strips as they are right up against the edge but you can add lights to the bottom. Overall very nice case for the money.P.s. try not to place a big heatsink on there. The noctua nh-u14s 140mm heatsink barely fits with the panel on.

I was a bit worried at first if it would arrive damaged, however when I took it out to inspect the case all those worries were quickly washed away. No scratches, dents, or damaged ports. Everything needed is included where the PSU would normally go, and the cables are twist tied together along the back. It comes with 3 fans and a RGB control hub.  Using this to build a Ryzen 7 3700x machine, haven't built a PC in a little over 7 years so this is going to be a lot of fun for me!
"
Bryan Garcia,5.0,2021 7 June,"
This case is a good case if you want to incorporate lots of fans and AIOs into your build. Only gripe is you need special screws if you want to do a push-pull configuration with a front mounted AIO but they’re fairly cheap screws. Cable management is decent and it’s easy to route your power supply cables since this case uses large cable portals.Added photos comparing the cpu temps at idle loads.Old case: NZXT h510 - 45° idleTD500 Mesh - 29° Idle16° delta with the case alone.
"
Tristen,4.0,2020 20 December,"
Pros: Nice Airflow, three preinstalled fans, and its just a nice case in general.Cons: Lack of space in the back to manage cables.Things to know: The fans run at about 900 to 1000 rpm which is ok if you want it to be quiet and I personally think that the fans look bad and are of poor quality but 3 argb fans and a case for only 99 dollars is pretty cheap. Would put a picture of my built but phone is dead so Ill update this later and add picture so you can see what the back looks like.

Winkie,4.0,2020 1 September,"
honestly i love it i read a lot of reviews about getting a damaged product but mine seems fine all though the cords that already come plugged in are a bit confusing i’m assuming they’re for the fan lights but i have no idea where to plug them in on the motherboard and it’s my first time building a pc and my friends also are unsure of where they go so i don’t have the lights plugged in): the fans work perfectly fine tho! i like how roomy the inside is and how easy it was to take it apart and put it back together after building my pc.

Great case and I love it, but it did come slightly damaged where the PSU goes and the bent metal made it very difficult and a two person job to get the PSU mounted properly because of the damage. Overall it’s great and perfect though! And the glass is very durable my cat scratched it (with the clear plastic still on) and only the plastic scratched not the glass. It also has a lip for the glass to it doesn’t fall when unscrewing.

 The mesh and design of this PC case is superb. The air flow thanks to this pc case prevents any overheating. Btw, im using the noctua nh u12a with gigabyte aorus z490 vision g with i7 10700k cpu. Thanks to this pc case, the mesh and airflow design complement the fan cooler i used.OC my gpu and cpu(5.1mhz) and the vrm never went above 65 degrees celsius. On average its at around 48-55 degrees celsius. So if u want to do some serious oveclocking for 10th gen cpus without breaking the bank, this $100 pc case will complement the cooling thanks to the mesh design and triple fan setup.
"
oprib,5.0,2020 8 December,"
For under $100 this has to be on the top of your list. Looks good and has plenty of airflow with magnetic filters. No great option for cable management but this is also a cheaper case so the backside of your case will be Meh unless you are some god tier builder. Lots of options to rout your cables just not much on the back. Fans that it comes with are ok if you are on a budget but I am a Corsair fan guy so I will also promo those when I can and I swapped them out (even though they cost more than the mf case but 🤷🏼‍♀️).
"
Kop,5.0,2021 20 January,"
Case is of good quality, works well for its intended purpose, I do not have any sort of clearance issues with it, airflow is very open. The only thing that bothers me is the fact that the fans are ARGB rather than RGB, making them unusable with color control software on more popular of or most of modern motherboards, and the fans they included seem to be the cheapest fans coolermaster has, despite the fact that this isn't a 'cheap' case. Other than that good case, not deducting points for the fans since they're not something they have to include for the price anyways.

I'm now done assembling my PC and it was roomy and easily accommodated a liquid cooler. Cable management was easy. It looks very nice with the three included LED fans on front and the solid glass side. It's a nice change that it's white. I much prefer that to the common black case. I ended up not wanting to hassle with the liquid cooler and just put three fans blowing out for good flow. The whole thing seems to stay quite cool and I'm having no heat mgmt problems with my Ryzen 7. Note that I haven't gotten a new graphics card yet so we'll see but I feel confident.
"
Amazon Customer,2.0,2020 12 October,"
Aside from the thermals, I don't understand how this case is so highly reviewed. Some of my issues may be due to a bad unit, but others are just flat out design issues.The PSU shroud can not be removed and the installation opening is too small to run front panel cabling through it. I had to re-route my HD audio and sys fan cables after they were almost severed against the PSU and the edge of the shroud openingThe drive bay can not be removed, so the PSU cables get pressed tightly against the drive bay. This makes cable management an issue and, combined with the small PSU shroud opening, makes it very difficult to remove or rewire the PSU.The feet are uneven, so the whole case can rock back and forthThe front panel headphone jack is just bad. When normally connecting a pair of headphones, the sound comes out as mono. If I press harder, I can either get a stereo signal or just the left channel.All of the front panel IO generally feels very stiff and cheap. USB and 3.5mm devices don't connect smoothly and usually require a good shove.There was a paper barcode sticker on the back of the case. It took a good amount of scraping and goo-gone to remove it.In fairness, the thermals are good and the fans are fine. The fan lighting and control via the MSI app work well. There's just enough room for basic cable management in the back of the case, so it's passable.Overall, I definitely regret buying this case and would have returned it if I wasn't so impatient
"
Nate,4.0,2021 10 June,"
There is plenty of space in this case and has more than enough air flow. The only reason this is a 4 star review is because the 3 included fans stopped lighting up after about 2 days of having the thing.
"
Kyle,4.0,2020 8 October,"
I think this tower is great. The airflow is good, cable management is easy and well thought, the only problem I have is that the hot swap bays for your SSD'S and HDD's is too close to the PSU. I have a fully modular power supply and I really had to wedge the PSU in with all the cables attached. If you have a semi modular you might not run into this problem but it was a bit annoying for me. And no, you cannot take out the hot swap bay.
"
Kindle Customer,5.0,2020 31 December,"
This was my first DIY PC build.  This case stuck out to me because of the three front intake fans, room for a 240mm AIO radiator at top and cable management system. It will fit a monster GPU. the front fans are RGB, but you don't need to use them if you don't want to. Even with them turned on it's pretty modest. The tempered glass side panel is great to show off your parts or if you want to show off your RGB set up. Everything was really simple, and has performed great so far!

There is so much room to work with in this case.  The fans are so quiet too.  Everything is so bright!  I also have a Cooler Master 240mm liquid cooler installed at the top exhaust.  The tool-free HDD cage is nice and easy to access.  The power supply bay is isolated, filtered and is reversible.  I have nothing negative to note about this case.  The motherboard cutout is huge too.  It was easy to set up and very flashy.  Pictures don't do this case justice.  I don't know what the warmth rating is.  This case is very cool figuratively and literally!

This case is such a great value for the price. It looks so fancy and the LEDs are AWESOME! It's clean and easy to put together. Just make sure you got through the instructions before you start since it doesn't have them in exactly the right order for everything (at least not for my build, haha)Love it and especially love how the vent on the top has a removeable filter that keeps the dust out and is easy to clean. Fans are nice and quiet but do a great job.

Daveeeeeeep,5.0,2020 13 October,"
Real glass, heavy construction, sturdy. Case overall is really nice. Only complaint would be to have a few more fan slots but not sure where they'd even put them so its not a very reasonable complaint on my part. The case itself looks nice and very clean, not surprisingly you're able to hide every cable so it has a very minimal look to it inside. Have always love coolermaster products and would definitely buy this again/recommend. Dont know who is still using cd drives but obviously thats not possible with this case just in case youre living in the past.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 24 May,"
Td500 Mesh and ARGB. This is a solid case. The style is personal preference. The etched tempered glass is a nice touch. The fans are a little noisy but I adjust the fan curves and everything is fine. Building is very straightforward with plenty of room for expansion.With 3 fans and a real mesh front, I feel out of the box thermals would be good. I would add at least 1 exhaust fan in the back, though.I think the T500 Mesh is a good buy for first time builders, builders looking to upgrade because of air flow or builders looking for a case that looks different but provides good air flow.
"
Daniel Casildo,5.0,2020 28 August,"
Honestly, I had my doubts because it was basically $100 and there are great quality for cheaper but it shipped earlier than expected and I looked at the case and came perfectly intact. The rgb fans came plugged in to rgb controller, all stand offs were wrapped with the other cables neatly where the psu shroud is, and the cable management is great. Would 100% recommend if your build is more on the higher budget side and want something that looks nice. If you have a lower budget go for a cheaper, good quality case so you could spend the money in other areas.
"
Samuel Quiroz,5.0,2020 7 October,"
This was the case I went for my first build and it came out great. A lot of room for what I needed and excellent cut outs for cable management. Seriously, it was really easy to build with. Great for those wanting to use a push pull configuration in the front. Kind of a hassle to install by yourself but it is possible! Also, I recommend that you don't use any hard drives. By removing the mounts located inside the power supply shroud, you can give yourself more room to store cables if you just wanna to stuff them inside.

Mike Schmeling,3.0,2022 19 February,"
Fan works but top light does not but you don't know this until you have it put together and by then you don't want to start over atleast the fans work.
"
Kyle M.,2.0,2020 4 September,"
great quality, amazing design, and cooler master reliability. 3 case fans alone puts this case above just about everything at this price and they are not cheep fans, the fans alone will cost you almost 60 dollars purchased separately. recommend this case to anyone looks great at an unbeatable price point, beyond that it proforms great. the only complaint is the fan wires are a bit of a rats nest and the bottom of the case has a gap into the back that makes hiding the case fan wires a slightly harder job than it needs to be.Pros:looks amazinggood RGB not cheap flashy lights3 good fans included.good airflow at the priceCons:wire management is a bit harder than it needs to be due to the rat's nest that is the stock fanswire management made ever so slightly harder by hole next to PSU slot,mesh at the bottom of the PSU is not magneticcooler master logo on the front is not easy to remove.EDIT: the fans RGB failed suddenly, CM support is absolutely worthless they don’t reply to you took 27 total support tickets to finally be told they would not replace the fans and I would need to return the entire case, Amazon CS gave me a bill credit of 60 dollars to purchase a set of fans I spend a little more and got a nice set. While this is still the best case at this price point. Spend a little more and get something better
"
Brenda,5.0,2021 23 March,"
This case is perfect for someone who wants a different case. I started off with a Montech mini ATX, but Upgrading my computer meant I needed some more space, This case comes with awesome fans that are really quiet, plus they are cooler master fans that you can buy on amazon for extra fans. I love the design and the case is a quality product. The glass is heavy and durable, and the overall look is incredible.
"
Allan B.,5.0,2021 22 February,"
First time seeing a glass side panel like this, might be a very love it or hate it style, but I love it - This case has great airflow and while the metal and plastic used in the case doesn't feel the strongest, it's fine - not super cheap feeling either.  The glass panel is top notch though in terms of quality. Would easily fit a 360 AIO in the front if I wanted and cable management was a breeze.
"
Alluring,4.0,2020 31 August,"
Pros: cool looks, reset switch, low tempsCons: front fans suck, front panel feels very cheap, psu dust filter is crapOne to two of the front 3 pre installed fans will not spin once the PC is fully booted. I tested all the fan headers and it is not an issue with the motherboard. This problem persists 6 out 10 times I boot the computer. The fans themselves work, but potentially a ball bearing issue. Temps have suffered due to this issue.
"
Edgar Ceballos,4.0,2020 26 October,"
PROS: This system is nice looking, the fans are really nice, and the addressable RGB syncs well with any motherboardInstallation is normal and does have space, however...if purchase bellow $100 is great value and looks (I customized the case to give better appealing white, see pic)CONS: Priced be over $100 it lacks all the features other systems like Lian Li comes at the same priceNone of the parts are configurable or movable

 prosthere was plenty of space to work with, and cable management was good.i like the RGB fans that are preinstalled in it.consno optical drive slot so if you want it. most like just use USB drive or usb disk player.the spacing on the radiator and the ram slot were tight so i end up having to move right between the 2 radiator fans.only 2 USB slot at the front of the case.
"
Chase,5.0,2021 8 February,"
I’ve been using this case for about a week and so far I’m loving it! Front glass and back panel are easy to remove and put back, instillation of my motherboard was easy. The wire management was easy with convenient wire holes. I get great ventilation (3 intake fans, 3 exhaust fans)  only small down side is the RGB lights on the fans only have a few settings. But that’s ok, I found one that goes well with my color scheme.
"
Mason Middleton,5.0,2020 21 December,"
I like the case very much, having the 3 fans at the front and already them accessible to hook up is a great in my book. In this case I was able to fit about 4 more 120mm fans, an Asus Prime z390-A and a Zotac 2060 Super. This case looks really good with the RNG and has maintained a cool state since my purchase. If you have a bigger motherboard this isn't for you but other than that I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!!!!
"
AC,3.0,2022 3 January,"
Not sure if it's just me, but my 3 120mm lighting fans are generating some random noises which I don't know how to fix and it's really annoying. I would have given it 5 stars if they come with better quality 120mm fans

 Great case with lots cooling capabilities and air flow. Specially love the 3 front stock ARGB fans. After 7 years of not building a custom PC, I came back to the game not knowing what to pick for a case. Most cases out there look very similar in design. The Cooler Master TD500 Mesh design is the most attractive unique design on the market.
"
Kristina M.,5.0,2021 27 January,"
I assembled a computer inside this case, which is pretty easy since there is a lot of room. As soon as I turned it on the ARGB fans lit up the inside beautifully. Easy to clean as well since you just remove the front panel and blow off the dust (Tested with the black variant that I also own). I recommended and showed it to my friend which he said he would most likely buy one. Great case for the price.
"
Megan,4.0,2021 6 April,"
Beautiful case. Can't wait to finish assembly and power it up.My only issue is the window for the motherboard. Shouldn't there be a frame of sorts? Or was I supposed to acquire one with the motherboard? This is my first time building a computer, so I'm learning as a go.
"
J. McCarthy,5.0,2021 23 July,"
Love this case. It has lots of features that make for an easy build and cable management - plus it looks really cool! The only thing I wasn't sure about were the 2.5 drive mounts. They are a little different, just a screw peg with rubber mounts, but they work really well.
"
Kota,5.0,2021 7 November,"
Honestly great case, very roomy. There’s more than enough space for upgrades.I just bought the case and handed it off for the build.
"
Jeremy Green,4.0,2021 30 April,"
A great case for midrange builds.  Plenty of soace, decent cable management, and a unique look.  Airflow is solid.  Build quality of back panel area and PCI/PSU are not the best, but worth the price!
"
Ben W.,5.0,2021 28 June,"
Case is super well made, lots of room, and great airflow and decent cable management. The only thing to beware is adding a 360mm radiator on top - depending on your motherboard it may be difficult to insert RAM and manage the upper cables. I still managed to do it, and the PC looks and works great!
"
Ethan,3.0,2020 17 November,"
Though the case looks great I would not recommend buying this product unless you have the full intentions of replacing all the fans with a different brand as these do not provide any cooling for your components. My case also came with faulty fans and upon trying to resolve the issue through amazon the only options they gave were to disassemble my entire PC and replace the case entirely, or they would offer me a 20% discount for my troubles and $20 is not enough to replace all 3 fans. The audio ports are also not ideal, they require a lot of force to plug in and remove equipment and don't provide the best connection. I'm unsure of how long they will last with that kind of ware on the ports like that. The provided room for installing power plugs is minimal and hard to maneuver as well. So keep this in mind while you're ordering this product.
"
Ran,5.0,2021 3 February,"
Tech Jesus said it was pretty good with thermals and this one was quickly available. Was doing a new build so didn't want to wait for ""in stock on---"" items. Running good temps and it's quiet, granted this is also my first time running an AIO so maybe that's why. Good openings for running cables, easily able to remove extra items, like hard drive spacers since I'm just using NVME on mine. Clean case.
"
Taylor,3.0,2020 19 July,"
I love the design and it came without any damage to the product; however, the box did get damaged before it arrived.With a Corsair H100i, there will be a gap to fill with another fan since it supports 360mm worth of fans on the top; also, the RAM (XPG Spectrix D60G) seems to barely fit on the top with the radiator and fan and an ASUS Prime x570 pro. There is a window on the CPU shroud, so keep that in mind if you get a black PS. Lastly, the top dust filter has bigger holes than I expected, so I'll be using fans there to push (move air out)I haven't assembled anything yet, so my only reason for 3 stars is because I was sent a black case instead of a white. I think the black one will do just fine, and with the damaged box and so many reviews about the case getting damaged during shipping it seems safer to keep the one I was sent.
"
Prekay,5.0,2021 9 March,"
Absolutely beautiful. I just set it up today and all my friends are super jealous! 😍 I’m so happy with it! (I added an extra fan to the back, the case only comes with three fans all on the front!) I will say that my power button feels a bit awkward to press, but it’s not a big deal! I love this case! The case is also staying amazingly cool! Awesome!
"
Fitzj,5.0,2021 2 July,"
I bought used and it's basically new. Only the box was a bit beat up but the case was fine and had all the parts in it. The 4000 D is cheaper but this was the same price used so I went for that and I'm satisfied with it and no complaints so far
"
Kindle Customer,4.0,2021 6 August,"
looks great but not enough room for wires in the back
"
Asher Stubbs,3.0,2021 27 August,"
The build quality is pretty good. Instructions are vague and confusing with no written english just pictures illustrating. My main complaint is this will not accommodate a coolermaster 240 cpu cooler with my tomahawk b450 motherboard as it interferes with the ram. Had to do a front mount cooler which is not ideal. The controller that comes with the case for the argb fans is also pretty sucky, not having the selection for the color we were wanting as our mobo does not have argb headers.
"
Tristan Rice,3.0,2020 28 August,"
Let me first off in giving some background I bought this case for my 3rd PC build I liked the front case design, side glass panel, and the the three large fans on the front of the case. I felt that that was ample amount of cooling. Then the build started... the bottom deck for the power supply is very tight for a 750W power supply and good luck plugging any new pci ports after installed. The RGB is a nightmare still haven't gotten all the bugs worked out with that yet two fans are light but one is not and i cannot change the color. They don't really give you anything with the case or support online with troubleshooting with there products. Over all experience ascetically beautiful case strong and sound would recommend an output fan as my GPU does run a little on the warm side but for the money not a bad option but there are way better cases on the market.
"
Trey,5.0,2021 25 June,"
Great case. Lots of cable routes. Comes with the 3 front fans that have RGB, you can use the included controller, or if your MOBO has a connection to control the color scheme. Does NOT have an exhaust fan at the back of the case, no big deal fans are cheap. Great air flow.
"
Jay,5.0,2020 20 June,"
Changed a few things but great looking case. Full diclosure I used my own fans in the pic.Complains:The dust filter for the power supply is horrible. Seen this desing before as cost cutting measure but this is be far the worst.I hate power supply cut outs. I was not about to spend money on a white power supply so just bought some vinyl wrap for $10 and turned out pretty good.Lastly I wish the basement ran all the way across the bottom of the case for a cleaner look.
"
joshua weimer,5.0,2021 21 December,"
Great cooling.  3080ti TUF card stays 60-65c air cooled.
"
Sickone,5.0,2020 24 July,"
This case has great looks with rgb fans and some of the best airflow since the HAF cases of 10 years ago. well worth the money.Edit, this case does not need a filter material due to the size of the mesh, it is easy to keep clean and keeps the dust to a minimum inside the case after 3 months of use (24/7 use) my case has a total of 7 fans in it 3 intake and 4 exhaust and have never had any temperature issues.
"
Dawn,5.0,2020 26 September,"
Absolutely amazing! This is my first PC build and my boyfriend helped me pick out the case. It looks so pleasing, the color options are really nice, and it’s BIG!I didn’t think it would be as big as it is, but I really like it. Tons of space inside for everything I need, and the added zip ties and spots in the back to hide everything are real nice and keep it looking good. I’m really happy with this purchase :)
"
William Rabquer,5.0,2020 26 May,"
To start off I really like the look of this case it really can turn any computer into a looker! It has a solid build quality and an awesome looking side panel! The fans are barely audible and if you can find a good cooler master program to run them they look really nice!My only con is that the power supply shroud is riveted in place and cannot be removed.Besides that for $100 you are getting a $100 quality case as well as a free $50 gift of fans! Highly recommend!
"
Deeply Disappointing Spoon,5.0,2020 27 October,"
The air flow is bae. Three stock fans definitely ARGB and integrated perfectly on my B-550.My favorite part about the front stock fans is that it kind of prevents people from incorrectly mounting the water cooling they often buy, too. It's a bit of a stretch to front mount an AIO in this case, as it is a stretch for the hoses to get from the CPU down to the bottom of the front of the case.
"
Rhett,5.0,2021 12 September,"
I built my first PC in June and selected this case. It took me a couple hours to build but everything was easy to mind and there’s a lot of extra space!
"
Oscar,5.0,2020 30 November,"
Stunning case. Great price and easy to build on. The only con is that if you're using a top mounted AIO cooler then you must install the ram beforehand as you won't have enough space to remove it or replace it. You have to unscrew your radiator if you want to add or remove ram afterwards. No biggie.Love the case. The front fans are great but do make more noise than I'd like.
"
CD,3.0,2021 3 February,"
Loved this thing at first. Looks great, came with 3 fans, was easy to build in... cable management cound be a bit bigger of an area but it works.I didn't get the rest of my build parts in until early January so I was able to use this case until then...Within a month the bottom front fan sometimes stops spinning and I can't figure out why. Seems to get stuck. Cables are all solidly connected, nothing is in the way... it just stops working. A hard blow on it gets it back spinning but for a fan to begun havung issues running at fairly low RPMs on a very low use basis... maybe 3 or 4 hours a week tops... this fast is kind of ridiculous.Other than that I love the case.
"
SkyePanda,5.0,2021 26 August,"

"
Jason Lee,5.0,2020 27 September,"
The case is great, very sturdy, and overall has a great look!The only issue that I have with the case is that it is very cramped and was very difficult to insert some plugs onto the motherboard. Another issue that I had was that I ordered a white case, but a black case was delivered. I was pretty upset upon arrival, but after putting together my PC it looks great!Very affordable and great product for its value!
"
Brian B,5.0,2021 17 February,"
Great airflow rgb fans connect well with armory crate software however it is a pain to connect all the rgb wires and get the rgb working also the wires are really sensitive  so try not to reconnect and disconnect a lot otherwise you going to have to strain the wires  in order for them to work but otherwise great case with good airflow
"
Carlos,5.0,2020 3 July,"
This case is amazing and sexy at the same time. Not a ton of airflow but decent. Make sure that you get a few more fans. Lot of room and lots of space for wire management. RGB is addressable and looks awesome. Tempered glass is thick and solid. Great design and can be opened without tools. Plenty of room inside for water cooling and can support 3 additional fans if using 120mm. Lots of space for motherboard and Graphics card. Very well made case and color is sweet!
"
Finch,5.0,2020 27 June,"
Looks great and keeps all my hardware thermals at optimal levels for over clocking and high end gaming performance. I did have to reroute the USB cables, power button cable, and the audio input cable to keep them out of site but it took about 2 min to hide them. The SSD mount in the back was very convenient and gets an extra 2 drives in my machine.  I rate this 10/10. I would def recommend to anyone looking to get a case with good airflow.

 This box went perfect for the white build I wanted to go for. Matching components was easy and had no problem with finding correct attachments. I will recommend however to purchase the usb 3.0 sata adapter extension. You will have some trouble fitting the large USB 3.0 cable to the motherboard and fitting ssd drives to the proper lacation. Plus it makes for good cable management.

Aaron Preston Aldrich,5.0,2021 8 September,"

"
Whitney,5.0,2020 10 September,"
Love this case was really easy to put together for a first time pc build.Really beautiful and does a great job keeping things cool.Usb ports are in good locations.Only down side (but my fault)  is the my motherboard only has hook ups for rgb and not argb which is what the case has so I can't control light color of the fans. Nonetheless they look great to me so no worries.
"
John Tristan Palanca,5.0,2021 16 February,"
This case should cost way more than it does. Build quality is great and airflow is unmatched. The 3 included ARGB fans work great with Asus Aura Sync and come attached to a 3-1 splitter out of the box. The other plus besides killer airflow is the ease of cable management. Cooler Master really thought this one out, super happy with this!
"
Brandon,5.0,2020 19 November,"
this is one of the best cases ive built in. good cable management great looks great air flow pre installed atx stand off's great build quality for 100 bucks reusable pcie plates  3 great argb fans which are 20 bucks a pop by themselves. only downside ive found is the rgb is confusing too hook up and the instructions didn't really help much for that. other than that amazing buy.
"
Joseph,3.0,2021 22 March,"
For starters this is a beautiful case. That said, the mesh front panel, though can be removed, might cut your fingers trying to take it off. It's a big pain. The only dust filter they give you is on the top of the case... The top... We're your pushing air from the inside up and out... Why? Do I need to filter the air that comes from my pc? Or my room... Answer is my room... That said, it was not well thought out. Ether way I'll make due with some form of custom dust filter for the front. The bottom psu shroud cover does NOT come out. This makes for very tight custom work of water cooling or even getting screws in the bottom front fan.
"
stephen phillips,5.0,2021 2 April,"
This case is great. Lots of air flow. A lot of room in this case, I fit both of 240mm rads in it with no fitment issues at all. Wiring is a bit tight in the back but not too bad. I picked this up on sale but would have paid full price if I had to.
"
Tony K.,5.0,2021 8 June,"
Great case, easy to build with good cable management. I also have a bunch of shredding pets and was a little worried that hair would get past the fans in the front—-that hasn’t happened and it’s been several months running! Highly recommend this one.Oh, and it looks great!
"
Henry Wing,5.0,2021 4 February,"
This case is beautiful, easy to open and put back on, offers a lot of space for add-ons and great airflow. The only bad thing is the distance in the back of the case, they don’t give you enough room to do cable management well so you have to sorta fight to get the back panel on again
"
Argusi,5.0,2020 8 August,"
Used this for my sons first gaming PC build and it was great to work on. Really appreciate being able to remove the drive cage for more room, not that the case is cramped. There's plenty of room in there for extra peripherals. We were going to set it up and see if more fans were needed, but it's keeping everything plenty cool with the stock 3 fans in our configuration. Highly recommend this case.

gilbert,5.0,2020 22 November,"
Overall pretty good. Good airflow, a lot of extra room coming from a H510. I did have minor Glass defects but it’s hard to see at certain angles. Power supply dust filter is not that useful. Also.. rgb fans that are included are 5v / 3 pin did not work with my mobo. (Msi b450 T max) Had to get a converter to work.

Great case with LOTS of airflow and room to work with. If you don't care or need a disc drive or a ton of HDDs then I would get this case. Will replace the top 2 140mm i currently have with 3 120mm ones soon. Getting great temps while gaming or when mining overnight.
"
Heather Wiese,5.0,2020 25 October,"
This case is fantastic!! Tons of room for my fans, I only air cool so I am running 6 case fans and two fans on my 212 evo cooler which fits comfortably. The Tempered glass makes a good seal for air flow and I love all the room for cable management. Those looking for a good air flow case on the cheap should start here.
"
Emanuel Pergjoni,5.0,2020 19 November,"
Bought this for my new pc build, overall great quality case, a few things to note is that it doesn't come with an exhaust fan so I recommend buying one or moving one from the front to the back. Also if u do not set a custom fan curve at idle it is very quiet but when gaming they seem to speed up alot
"

Alex,4.0,2021 3 January,"

PROS*3 Pre installed fans*Nice mesh dust filter for the front panel for airflow*Okayish magnetic dust filters on the top of the case and on the PSU intake twords the bottom.*Sleek, Clean look*Easy to install and take off side panels.CONS*Good lord the cable management room on this case is non existent, trying to fit a basic ATX PSU was what caused me to write this review in the first place, theres no room for cables.*Case fan names aren't specified anywhere and dont move much air at all.*no support for 140mm exhaust fans.OVERALLDecent beginners case, itll stress you out but itll keep all your parts together and it wont suffocate them. If you can afford it an extra 100 or 50 bucks can get you a better case.

Fantastic case, looks amazing. Fit Corsair liquid cooling, Z490 Intel motherboard, asus TUF 1660 super 3x fans, rgb Corsair RAM 8gb x4 and Corsair 750RX power supply in it. All fit well, though I had to make an adjustment to fit both rgb RAM and the liquid cooling. Looks incredibly sleek. Recommend if trying for a build using a white case.Packaging was nice.Chords are high quality and aesthetic.Everything you want from a case.

I purchased this case for my very first pc build. This case has a great stylish look. The front rgb lights come pre-installed. The only minor thing I didn't like about the case was the space for cable management was a little tight. But that could have been a result of me being a novice pc builder. I highly recommend this case to everyone.
"
Ryan,5.0,2020 6 October,"
Looks great, I did not have any issues with broken parts when I received it, easy to clean. Cable management was a little snug, but I built my first computer with this case so I probably could have routed the cables better. If you are looking for a case for a white pc build I think this is a great choice for the value.
"
Kevin DuVall,5.0,2021 5 March,"
The case looks really cool and clean. I am very particular with things, so I can tell some of the plastic isn't the highest quality and the fans maybe aren't cooler master's highest quality fans either. However, for the price, this thing is awesome. I can't not give it 5 stars overall.
"
ANDREW,3.0,2021 7 February,"
This is a decent case that I bought only because it was the only thing in stock. While the airflow is good, it has some design issues:The case is on a cramped side. It could have been a few inches longer / wider for easier access.The PSU area is very difficult to get to.The PSU air filter is a flimsy mesh that doesn't have a frame, making removing/installing it a painThe top mesh filter is held magnetically. This is fine as long as one doesn't have a cat that likes to jump up on a computer.The front bezel connectors are left as individual plugs, making connection to the motherboard a bit of a hassle.
"
Mary Ellen,5.0,2021 9 May,"
Love it! Fits my comments nicely and and the mesh looks amazing, if you get the asus prime x570-pro it will hid half of the top metal bracket but other then that it's amazing. Has nice room for cable management if you know what you are doing.
"
walker Rowcliffe,3.0,2021 11 December,"
Case is really nice and the white has held up. Roomy, only thing is the glass side panel scratch so easy
"
J,4.0,2020 20 December,"
Not a bad looking case with RGB fans included. The airflow is good I have a rtx3070 and Ryzen 5 5600x and it never gets hot. I do have total of 7 fans so that helps as well
"
Patrick W. Lamar,5.0,2021 29 April,"
This case looks super nice.  I know that some people have complained about cable management but with some time and patience I was able to have a tidy install.  Additionally the cooling in this case is amazing and has very good air flow.
"
Kris,4.0,2020 22 December,"
This was delivered and it was wrong color. It is not black, it was white! Matches my son's PS5, so we kept it.My son was building a gaming computer and this case fit his rtx 3070.
"
Gary Christian,5.0,2020 7 November,"
This was a great buy for the price. It's easily accessible with install/cable management and has plenty of room for whatever. The fans are a tad bit noisy but they're not terrible overall and they keep the temps pretty low. The aesthetic of the entire case is very impressive, especially the rgb lights included on the fans.
"
Lilian Vargas,4.0,2020 25 June,"
came in impeccable condition however I didn’t anticipate it to be so large. I should have checked measurements for how big this case would be, it is beautiful and keeps my pc very cool to the touch however if I had done more research I probably would have opted for a smaller case.
"
Johnathon ,4.0,2021 25 May,"
Not a lot of space for cable management
"
zdsorenson,3.0,2020 1 October,"
Won't fit my mother board and the screws to remove parts to allow stuff to fit are nonsensical non-standard IDK but I will update when I can make my computer b/c right now I can't b/c my motherboard won't fit into this thing and there is no clear screwdriver that I can use to take the case apart.  Idk wtf screws they used on this thing but they clearly aren't standard and I've not been provided a tool to unscrew them.Update, I was being sorta dumb and frustrated, leaving old stuff for context.  Case is decent but I/O shield is hard to fit if pre-installed stand off gets in the way and an adapter screw comes with case but is very unintuitive.
"
Wren,5.0,2020 23 September,"
So pretty!! It does need some additional outtake fans, as the 3 in the front are all I take. It’s really nice that the case comes with 3 rgb fans included and already installed. There’s not a bunch of room for cables in the back, but it’s enough. I love the design and the mesh front and top. Very good value!!
"
Mike s.,5.0,2021 2 October,"
great case. love that it came with fans and rbg light controller
"
Dogebass00,5.0,2021 1 July,"
its a great pc case and other than the fact it had limited instruction is was fairly easy for someone doing their first completely custom build. 10/10 would recommend to the next person.
"
Jay Bizzel,4.0,2020 5 August,"
The case is fine. It was a bit of a pain in the...butt. The compartment for your power supply drives etc...was a bother to mess with otherwise it's a nice unit. 29'th build on my end and this one was difficult. Maybe I'm just gettin' old IDK
"
Kurt T.,5.0,2020 6 December,"
If you are looking for a beautiful tower with amazing lightning and rgb, then this is the one to buy. For less than $100, you can't beat this tower! The only thing I can say negative is the dust gets in too fast but it's not hard to remove once a week.
"
Bryson Bergquist,5.0,2020 26 December,"
Absolutely love this case, it's got holes where you can stick all your cables through from the backend to the frontend of the case. Very easy to take apart and put back together. The 3 pre-installed fans are very convenient and easy to plug in to the motherboard. Awesome Cooler Master product!
"
Spencer Jones,4.0,2020 8 August,"
Overall I love the design. I’m new to PC and everything seems to be functional. My biggest reservation is that the top fan does not light up, which I picked this product for the lighting aesthetic. So that has been very frustrating and disappointing for me.
"
Tom Baldinger,5.0,2021 28 March,"
Fits my Gigabyte B450 Aorus Elite V2 motherboard great.Only problem i had was with using my 360mm AIO in the top it was to long to have a fan in the rear of the case. Other than that everything fits perfect
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 4 October,"
The fans look great when they're powered on, and the mesh front and top make the entire PC super cool (both temperature and looks).One thing though- the cables for the fans can be a bit confusing. I personally didn't use the physical controller, instead plugging the fans into an ARGB header on the mobo.
"
Robert,5.0,2021 31 January,"
Well it comes pre assembled. Bought for a build I'm working on now. Still lacking parts, mainly a GPU. In no rush. Will post pictures when the build is completed. Going for a white/black/silver build and paired with the asus prime z490a it should look decent.
"
Rheyne,5.0,2021 22 June,"
Excellent view of the inside of the case, and excellent cable management options at the back of the case. Makes your components appear more threatening than they actually are, according to guests.
"
Drake,5.0,2021 20 September,"
No complaints. Looks really cool. Nothing too crazy to complain about
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 7 September,"
Love it! Has all the output I need for the perfect gaming case!
"
Seamus McDermott,3.0,2021 19 February,"
Kind of a pain in the arse, but the front case fan (lower one of three) fails to start after only one week.If you go to the Cooler Master site, they have a warranty of two years.  Getting warranty service is as easy as pushing a Buick with two flat tires across a gravel parking lot.  The terms make your eyes glaze over.We know the fan is getting power, and it runs if you spin it with your finger.  It just won't start by itself.After less than a week, this is very disappointing.
"
winnieyiyi,5.0,2020 11 December,"
I bought this case for my new PC build and it's been nothing but fantastic ever since it arrived. The quality is very nice and there's really great airflow. I fit a Gaming X Trio 3070 just fine so you can fit any GPU you want in here.
"
Mia Bruzenak,5.0,2020 16 September,"
I absolutely love it!! I did not put it together, but my boyfriend did and he completed it so quickly! The colors are beautiful and I never feel any heat from it. The colors do turn off when the computer is off which is a great energy saver. Very esthetic and worth it!
"
Samantha Verna,5.0,2021 2 September,"
I had my friend assemble it for me. I love the outcome
"
Danial Hallock,5.0,2020 24 May,"
I ordered the white case the day it came out, and unlike the black case it did NOT arrived damaged, nor do the concerns about the glass being cheap appear valid.  It did not, however, come with a rear fan.Otherwise, the reviews on the black case being easy to assemble, yadda yadda translate well to the white case.
"
Agustin Marquez,5.0,2020 25 June,"
I love this case! (TD500 Mesh White ARGB) It's amazing with plenty of space for cable managing and even more space if you remove the hdd mounts located at the bottom of the case. The fans do their job while looking great as well. The tempered glass is beautiful. Overall i am very happy and pleased with this purchase.
"
Jacob Herrman,3.0,2020 17 August,"
This case was easy to assemble and offered a lot of great cable managment opportunities. Generally this is a solid case for the price. However the biggest complaint I have with this case is related to the front panel. This case's fans can vibrate your case, because they do not come with any anti vibration pads on the screws. While running my case at certain fan rpms i can gear a loud vibrating noise coming from my case and even feel the front panel vibrating to the touch. I can generally run my case fans at a low rpm, since the case does have great air flow. However this is still something to keep in mind.
"
Mia,3.0,2021 14 July,"
I bought this case for my step son. He loves it and is very excited about his new case. My only issue with it so far is that they do lie on the listing. It has an acrylic side panel, not tempered glass. Will be reporting the listing for false advertising.
"
Levi,5.0,2021 15 February,"
Super easy chassis to work with, great for cable management The standoffs and fans came pre-installed. Quality of product is nice and the airflow is awesome. Glad I went with this case cause it functions great and looks even better.
"
Coty Wheeler,5.0,2021 20 June,"
Excellent Product. Came right on time, and it was able to fit of my MSI and Corsair tech inside the whole case. would strongly recommend buy this case.
"
FLOFCT,3.0,2021 22 June,"
I bought 2 cases had to get them replaced RGB lights did not work in one and the other 2 very dim and one dead.The replacements worked for 6 months and LEDs stopped working.FYI if the leds don't work you have remove all the components and send it back, they will not send out replacement LEDS. very poor support. Not recommended
"
Ayrton Emil Sanchez,5.0,2020 24 July,"
This is a great case, it looks great and works perfectly, has great airflow and a lot of space for everything, for the price this is the best you can find. The only downside of this case is the dust filter for the power supply is just a cheap thin metallic layer can be lost easily.
"
Daniel Mateo,5.0,2021 13 July,"
Very good fans, the rgb looks very good, and the air preassure is correct, is big enough and have good wire system

Tyler Nguyen,5.0,2020 9 September,"
Bought this CoolerMaster case to only find out that during assembly it did not fit my CoolerMaster MasterLiquid ML240L RGB V2? Would have assumed that all the CoolerMasters are compatible with each other so it took nearly 2-hours of improvisation for this to work. I used PC part picker as well!
"
Apex Azriel,5.0,2021 15 April,"
This case was easy.  Had good airflow and cable management design.  For a basic, 2021 computer component build it was stylish and provided a good form for both air and liquid cooling options.
"
Faith,5.0,2020 6 October,"
Guys, this will hold a fat coolermaster cpu cooler, and not even get close to touching the glass and a big motherboard, a rtx 2060 super 8GB OC. has bill and teds excellent adventure airflow from the front. If you also like rgbs on your fans, this is your tower!

 It was really easy to build in. I received this case in perfect condition with all of the hardware and paperwork included.I mounted the coolermaster rgb controller on the back of the case which made it easy for me to access.
"
Thoeuth Chum,3.0,2020 30 May,"
This TD500 Cooler Master Case Mesh is a very great case. It has a somewhat acceptable moderate amount of airflow, a little bit of rgb for your rig if it doesn't have it, and a decently large interior for a Mid-Tower case (In my opinion). Everything in this whole case seemed good so far until I switched it on for the very first time and found a small imperfection. One of the led's on the front panel fans didn't light up. It was a very minor mistake but somehow still irritates me. I know I could just replace it or return/ get a refund but I already assembled my computer, therefore I would not like to go through the process of disassembling it.
"
Anonymous Cool person,4.0,2020 30 September,"
This is amazing! It looks so cool and has great airflow. The only complaint I have, and is the reason I wrote this is because I ORDERED WHITE. I RECIEVED BLACK. WHY?!?!???!?!?
"
Brendan,4.0,2020 11 November,"
RGB didn’t work on the preinstalled fans so I had to wait another week for my fans to come in the mail to complete the build
"
Karmen ,5.0,2021 12 April,"
I love it <3 It did not come damaged maybe it's not a sender problem but a carrier prob because it was well protected (i dunno) But highly reccomend, air flow is excellent.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2021 22 January,"
Great starter case, however fans are a little loud...maybe due to poor quality bearings. Nonetheless happy with my purchase.
"
Carlos,4.0,2021 23 April,"
it's Great!
"
BradE17,4.0,2020 18 December,"
Quality case, doesn’t look as good in person...kind of cheesy. Other than that it has great airflow and cool looking fans.
"
Leo_10,5.0,2021 14 August,"
I love it, it looks and performs amazing. Thanks cooler master.
"
alonso29,4.0,2020 16 May,"
Good case for the price. Some of the flaws include the cheap quality dust filter for the power supply and the fans included. While not excessively loud by any means, the fans do make more noise than expected.
"
John Kusluski,5.0,2020 27 November,"
Very high quality pc case. By far the nicest I’ve ever built in. Comes with 4 fans already. My gpu and cpu are 10 degrees Celsius cooler than they were in my last case, and it looks good. Highly recommended.
"
River,4.0,2020 1 December,"
my only downfall with this case is one of my fans came broken and does not light up like it is supposed to
"
Nichole,5.0,2020 16 May,"
I looked at so many gaming cases and this one caught my eye. It has AMAZING cable managment creating a super clean look. The RGB is very bright and theres a button to change the color patern. Such a killer deal with the 3 fans included. IM TOTALLY IN LOVE AND SUCH A GREAT PRICE!!-GamerGirl

Jeremy,5.0,2020 22 July,"
Loved building with this case! Spacious easy to navigate plenty of tie downs and routes for cable managment. Super easy & intuitive. Screws stay with the panel when you take of the sides so you can't lose them lol plenty of spare parts screws, ties, etc... 10/10 recommend
"
Christy,5.0,2020 5 November,"
It didn’t come damaged, very gorgeous, seems sturdy so far and airflow is nice! The only con is not much space for the cables in the back, had a hard time getting it to shut. Most importantly, my baby approves c:
"
Orlando MaRTINEZ,5.0,2020 11 September,"
I'm very happy with this case and have no complaints at all. There is plenty of space and the front fans are very nice. Cable management is easy as there is plenty of space. Overall case looks great and price is very fair.
"
Danielle GIl,5.0,2020 23 November,"
I love everything about this Case.  The color, the quality, the price, the fan lighting.  The airflow is perfect, and the mesh front is great. I couldnt ask for a better tower.  I recommend to anyone.
"
S1lence1,1.0,2022 21 September,"
This case has been horrible. The fan controllers dont work, theres zero space on the back panel for cables or ssd's. The front usb 3 ports work so slowly they arent worth using. This is a box with a power button and the mfgr doesnt respond to requests for help. DONT BUY IT!
"
Eli Kimball,5.0,2020 20 June,"
Finally decided to upgrade from my cramped  old tower. Couldn't be happier with my purchase.  The white is very sleek, tempered glass panel is easy to take off, and the back comes off as well for cable management. Tons of space for future hardware upgrades and additions.
"
Cody Clement,5.0,2021 4 June,"
Although the back panel was small when it came to wire management this was my first ever build and it looks amazing

"
KasprG,4.0,2020 30 September,"
Great case. Only wish I could see the psu. An opening to expose an rgb psu would get this case five stars.
"
Donald Green,5.0,2020 15 July,"
The space in the case is enough with a little extra. And plenty of air flows and fans in the right places. Highly recommend and totally worth. Im really happy with this investment and the people I hired to reassemble my PC for me also thought so too.
"
Rosendo Espinoza,5.0,2020 13 September,"
Great item, comes with 3 fans, not specified in item description but there it is. Comes in awesome packing, high quality and with alot of space inside. The magnetic mesh on top is very cool and keeps the dust away efficiently.
"
Paul,5.0,2020 23 October,"
Awesome case for the money! Excellent airflow and easy to work in.  Note: I did upgrade the fans and used the RGB controls off the mobo rather than the RGB controller that comes with the stock fans.

"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 23 May,"

"

"
Alizay Adamson,5.0,2020 16 June,"
Looks exactly like the picture and even better in person. I plan on adding more ARGB fans but even with just the ones it has it looks great. I was easily able to hide cables and there's tons of room for upgrades. Highly recommend.
"
Aaronel Haro,5.0,2020 6 September,"
I chose this instead of lian li mesh one simply because it was available and it didn't disappoint. One of the best values in the $100 segment imo. Better than the fractify c mesh for sure tho.

"
Richard,3.0,2020 28 October,"
Everything is great and nice on this case it’s awesome and the glass panel design is sleek and stylish however it only has 2 USBs on the front I wish I’d have noticed this before I bought it. That’s the only shortcoming if that isn’t a big deal to u then you prolly won’t mind but I can’t see designing a case without at least 4 USBs in the front.
"
Shawn Tucker,5.0,2020 30 May,"
Second build. I found this case to be fantastic. It was easy to build in, fans were prewired and worked, and looks stunning in white.The glass side panel looks great with the etching, and makes lines really stand out.

"
Destiny,3.0,2021 28 February,"
It was easy to assemble, but if you don't know a thing about wire management.. I suggest you learn. That's all this case allows. And where the power supply screws into the back it was dented, so I was only able to get two screws into the psu.
"
Butchee,5.0,2020 20 December,"
Nice and spacious. Able to fit 3 fan aio on top no issues. Wire management is solid. Fans are quite enough.

"
Crystal,3.0,2020 24 December,"
For my first pc build, I really liked this case. It’s a nice size and very pretty but there’s only one drawback, I didn’t receive the RGB controller that is supposed to come with this case. This case could have been a lot better if it came with the controller as it was supposed to
"
Luis Neris,3.0,2020 11 December,"
El case está muy lindo y es por su tamaño es fácil de trabajar en él. El problema es que llevo ya unas 3 semanas con él funcionando y los abanicos frontales están haciendo un ruido constante. El mismo se detiene cuando pongo la mano y hago algo de fuerza. Creo que deben estar algo sueltos.
"
Chew,4.0,2020 18 July,"

Ordered a white one and they sent a black one instead. 3 RGB fans on the front, middle RGB fan doesn’t work.The color black has grown on me and the RGB fan I don’t care anymore since I plan on upgrading them in the future. Nevertheless, I’m not satisfied or happy with the transaction, and returning it is just an inconvenience.Plenty of room for installation and good airflow

steve kennedy,3.0,2020 28 July,"
Functional case. Fans are too slow. Horrible quality on the front I/O panel. I can actually connect a USB cable backwards with little to no trouble. Rest of the case is just cheap but I knew that. It does work but I am replacing the fans. I would get the Lancool 2 mesh over this. I have one  ordered.

My son waited to buy this bc the rate went into effect on 10/11. He likes the case. Got everything. Loved into it. Does not like that fan lights do not have more controls and can’t control them thru the computer but instead the attached control to them.Anyways, item came in a big cool matter box with all kids of marking and labels. Yet, there is no UPC  code on box anywhere, inside, out, under labels, anywhere! And you need to attach the original UPC and send along with form. Well if there isn’t one what do the want?? Looked online and found this has been an issue with others and they had no resolution. Not sure if I will get anywhere with support when I can call them next week, not holding my breath, but this is not ok. Do not buy if you want the rebate at this time.

Mariel,2.0,2020 21 September,"
This case is authentically gorgeous. I loved that it included the RGB fans built in already and I didn't have to pay for them as an add-on. I had extremely satisfied with this case until a couple of days ago when the power button stopped working out of the blue. I realized this after I spent several hours trying to figure out why my PC wouldn't turn on. It is a big disappointment because this case looks awesome and I thought CM was a reputable brand. Had to return it after waster over 12 hours with it.

Bri Guy,1.0,2021 29 March,"
Overall, I like this case. The only problem I had was unfortunately a big one...the RGB doesn't work properly on the fans. Only two of my fans light up, and these two look ""messed up"" (see image).I have contacted Cooler Master support multiple times, but they have not responded for over a month. What's worse is that my friend got the exact same case and is experiencing the exact same problem. At first, I assumed the fault was mine and that I just needed to fix the wiring, but after many hours, I was not able to fix the issue.It would be nice if I could at least get a response... unfortunately, I have to give this a negative review.Had to update my review to a one star because now my USB drives are dropping out too. Still no word from customer support... cool.

I ordered this case new from Amazon. And there I was waiting patiently for all the parts to arrive. Once all parts of build were there, I got so excited on a weekend night (Friday) to put my gaming desktop together. And guess what. I open the box of the casing, and there is the casing but no screws / standoffs, nothing to mount the motherboard with. The paper that came with the box showed that I am supposed to have the hardware with it, but no hardware at all. You can imagine the emotional roller coaster. And this was past 7 pm so if any local computer stores who would have carried the screw kit were closed. Well basically i got 'amazon balled' if you know what I mean. And on top of that after seeing the case, i was like this is NOT a 100 bucks case. This is more like 55 bucks case, as the material is very flimsy and the cable routing is horrible.

Troll Monger,2.0,2020 13 November,"
The biggest draw back for this case and why I wouldn't buy it again lies in the PSU shroud design. Very, very tight PSU design, spent countless hours trying to fit power connectors through holes. If you have a modular PSU with a decently sized GPU and CPU cooler, steer clear from this case, as you will pull your hair out trying to fit and connect things. Not worth the time or hassle as this price point.

Jason Roberts,1.0,2021 4 June,"
This may be a decent box, however, I haven't got the build complete. The three pin fan connector does not easily fit on the standard 4 pin fan header. I mangled 2 headers and the plug and still haven't got it hooked up. In fact, I wouldn't even know it was the fan plug if I didn't look it up on youtube. Instructions are garbage. Probably end up sending it back over the stupid fans, which according to reviews run full blast until you set them in the bios. I wouldn't know, they wont plug in. Either way it's just a BS set up for something that should be a no brainer plug and go.
"
Nicole,1.0,2021 19 May,"
DO NOT BUYFirst few months were fine and then everything started to break. USB ports in the front are wonky…I can deal with that but it’s annoying. And now my fans in the front started to break down. They make horrific noises even when the GPU is super low with no programs launched.Their support didn’t help. They told me that I should have emailed them earlier because now “I’m out of warranty” since I bought it 4 months ago. I told them my problems didn’t start until this week and they told me tough luck.Now I have to buy a brand new case and rebuild my pc. So annoyed.

Upgraded my case to this. Plug everything in turn on not posting. Debug error says cpu. After a few hours of trouble shooting I finally unplugged the hd audio and bam it posted. So I’m thinking the HD audio circuit board or cord has a short and shorting the board out. Not happy with it but I don’t need the audio or mic jacks in the front.  So beware if you have this error try pulling that HD audio.

Robles Junior,1.0,2020 18 September,"
I've had this case for 3 months now and I am disappointed in the quality of the fans. They are loud and buzzy. I contacted the seller to send it back for a replacement but they said to contact the manufacturer. That's unfair as they were the ones who sold it to me not Coolermaster. Regardless, they are the sellers and need to replace parts or products as need be.The fans suck but they look good. The case overall is great. I am leaving the one star due to the customer support I received, the loud fans and the bent USB Port on the front.
"
Bo Yang,2.0,2020 30 June,"
The fans are sooooooo noisy. I have to unplug the fan power but just keeps the led on.Not bother to return it as I would have to go through all those again.The noisy is quite disrupting, totally unacceptable.Even the GPU's fans at full speed is better than those three fans,

 one of the fans was making a very faint noise out of the box and after the first week it was very loud and I didn’t want to disassemble everything in my build to return it. I wished I had returned it straight away. Also the mesh is what you see in the picture and not the fine kind that will catch dust (It’ll catch a rice grain but not lint/dust)Listen to your fans, before assembling your build.

"
Sean Staake,2.0,2020 19 September,"
selling this product without the controller needed to adjust the rgb settings is absolutely dumb. now im getting a case that appears to look amazing yet without said controller its an awful yellow light on the fans.
"
David S.,1.0,2020 14 December,"
Honestly, if it's at MSRP I would consider this case at all. Three out of Nine Motherboard Standoff Screws were stripped, I couldn't remove it after screwing them once unless I used a piler to secure the back side. VERY frustrating experience. Also the rear side of the case is a bit tie, if you have run a lot of power cables to the back or a RBG hub. It won't close at all. I am using M.2 I don't think it would close with 2.5 SSD.
"
Llocsird'o Ttam,1.0,2022 30 January,"

Upon arrival and after speaking with a representative at Amazon through chat, I was told to contact Coolermaster.com and to inform them directly about product. Two of the three front panel fans led lighting are not working. I was unable to contact anyone on the website and am not happy to have paid for a defective tower. :( Beware!
"
Not A Hacker,1.0,2020 6 June,"
Metal case around power supply and hard drives make it impossible to actually hook anything in. The wires that are already hooked up aren't labeled at all so unless you know exactly what you're doing you're screwed. I'd send it back if there were any quick replacements. DO NOT BUY THIS. I've literally never seen another case with this blockage, makes.ot impossible to snuggly fit any cables into.
"
Bryan P,4.0,2022 23 May,"
Very nice looking case with great airflow. However, I have to dock a star for a couple flaws.1. As others have pointed out, the back side doesn’t leave much room for cable management2. The top feels too low, to the point where if you have a radiator on the top of the case, you will need a slim fan because a normal one won’t fit next to the RAM (see picture)
"
Anthony Moser,1.0,2020 27 June,"

This case comes with terrible install instructions. A word of caution, the case has no location for  a DVD Drive. so the mother board comes with a DVD to install drivers. You have to hook up a DVD on the outside of the case to install the motherboard.

The temps of pc components are outstanding. The mesh design of the case with the provided fans works well. Add one more fan for some more evenly distributed airflow and you will be very satisfied. The looks are great, its very aesthetically pleasing. The case is very easy to build in, decent cable routing, and plenty of space. As with any products there are some manufacturing defect for some products, but I haven't seen any myself, so of course your mileage may vary. I can solidly recommend this case to anyone looking for a mid tower, ATX case with good airflow, and great looks.

don’t expect the rgb fans to work at this good of a price. the glass is beautiful and case is 10/10 with very nice material & easy to remove panels. great buy, just replace the rgb fans :)) fans don’t spin at all and the rgb on the fans doesn’t light up. overall if you’re looking at it, and are building on a budget, look no further, great buy.

"
Jennie,3.0,2021 27 January,"
As I mentioned on this review title and as you can see on the picture I uploaded, the only thing to complain is the first fan is not operating well. Therefore, I did not give it a 5 star.After I assembled my desktop computer, it worked fine at the first couple hours and then it stopped working. I had tried to check all of the cables and wires, and they all worked well and connected well. Then, I tried to use a pen to give it a force, and the fan would start to spin again. Several hours later, it stopped again, and I had to open the case and use the pen to force it to spin again. I repeated this process over and over again. Finally, it ended up with being tired to do it to make it operate, and I gave up.I am not 100% satisfied on this desktop case, I did not return it for a refund for two reasons:1. It's so heavy and it's inconvenient for a return.2. I spent an entire two days to assemble my desktop computer before I found out the fan was not operating properly. Therefore, it's not worth for a return, and I will let it go.
"
Sherri L Williams,3.0,2020 8 December,"
Overall the case is nice but it has one serious drawback and another issue..... Managing cables for larger power supplies that do not have flat cables (even fully modular ones) with the hard drive bay installed is a NIGHTMARE! The case switch button broke after only a few weeks of use. I had to super glue it back into place because the switch button is cheap plastic that is thermally attached. The fans look great, there were no sharp edges anywhere in the case, the tempered glass is beautiful if you want to show off a nice build. Overall I give this 3 out of 5 stars!
"
Zachary Cobb,2.0,2021 9 March,"
Let me start off by saying that I genuinely LOVE this case!  It was easy to build in for a first-timer and it looks amazing in my opinion!  The problem is the fans/fan hub that came with my example.  I purchased the TD500 Mesh, which states that it INCLUDES three ARGB 120mm fans and an ASUS Aura compatible ARGB fan hub.  The product gallery also includes photos of the newer mini-ARGB controller from Cooler Master.  What I received were 3 unmarked ARGB fans and an older, simpler-looking fan hub controller that only has one button to control the color of the fans.  I purchased this case specifically because it was supposed to include 3 ARGB fans and a fan controller that works with Aura Sync, and that is not what was included with my case.  The fans are ARGB, but only offer 14 basic lighting options.I LOVE the case and the fans function as any other ARGB fan would, but they are NOT Aura compatible, and that is the only reason that I'm even writing a review.  Save your money and buy another case you like for $60, then spend the other $40 on a 3+ pack of 3rd party fans with a decent controller.

This item I ordered was a Christmas gift for my grandson who lives out of state and just he received it on February 5, 2022 and it is damaged and bent. Why can't it be returned or replaced?

Fans and controllers were broken. The fans didn't light up at all. I guess Cooler Master just kind of forgot about implementing any kind of quality control. What makes this even worse is how Cooler Master's support has not responded to my support ticket for a month now because their ticketing system is broken. This wouldn't be a big deal if there were other avenues to get support, but there are none. Cooler Master will not answer phone calls, so I am just left with a broken controller and three useless fans.

Maybe I'm just unlucky but I always have problems with the audio jacks. My last cooler master case's microphone jack didn't work right out of the box.  I checked all the front panel connectors and even swapped out my motherboard.  When I got this case the audio jack didn't work and again I checked my front panel connectors and they were all in the right spot.

Got this to host my new AMD build, after 8 years on a Dell intel.So far it is great; there is a big glass window but I don't care, since it sits on the bottom of my desk. The cable management is great; and you can build with confidence that your cables are out of the way and tucked correctly. What is missing is some supports for SATA SSD; I had to improvise to install those; but nothing too hard.The fans in the front have a large airflow; the only downside is the top: the flimsy magnetic grille is moving easily as soon as you touch the top or put something on it; I would rather prefer a static grille like the front one; not sure why they made that magnetic grille.

Not a great photo, and it's still a build in progress, but I really love this case.  No issues or defects, but I do agree with other's that the cover for the PSU feels pretty cheap compared to the rest of the unit.  The directions aren't the best, but if you can follow pictures, you will figure it out.  Keep in mind arrow = positive (had to look that up).  Wire management was a HUGE improvement from my older case, so for me this was just a great case overall.  Only wish it had Razor Chroma integration like the Coolmaster Wraith Prism that came with my processor.

 Not a bad case but they did cheap out on some stuff to get it to this price point but solid for first time builder and it actually looks pretty good. Do note you will not be able to fit a 280mm radiator on top with some ram types. That was the most disappointing thing for me I really wanted to mount my radiator on top but it wasn’t fitting due to my ram size. But it was easy to take the front off and replace the front fans with the radiator fans and putting it all back together I was really surprised by this and it’s nice to know cleaning it will be a breeze.

T. Orna,4.0,2021 5 January,"
Overall, the case is very nice.  This was my first time building a PC, and everything went smoothly.  I like how the USB and Audio ports on this case are angled on the top so you can reach them easier.  The case is large enough to fit big CPU coolers like the Dark Rock Pro 4 I have in mine.  The only downside is the front 3 case fans that are provided are not totally quiet.  There is a constant hum.  I can only hear it if the room is quiet, so it isn't impossible to live with, but it is the reason for a 4-star review instead of 5.  Overall, I'd probably buy this case again, but you may want to consider replacing the front fans with premium ones if total silence is important to you.
"
Edward S Cox,5.0,2020 25 September,"
I used this case for my first build, it was very easy to assemble. I was kind of shocked how easy it was, I don't know if it was this case that made so easy or that I had it built up in my mind it would be hard. Anyways I have a total of 6 fans in this case and never is this case hot! I am playing games at highest setting and my temp levels are still at normal. It looks so cool as well. I'm not one of the gamers that has to have their computer lit up so you can see inside, but the lights in the front around the 3 front fans has some cool light combinations. The tempered Glass side is very durable and made out of quality product. If you are looking for a case that has amazing ventilation, super easy to assemble, amazing cord management and that looks and cool, buy this one.

Woke up in the morning to find the tempered glass just exploded and sent glass everywhere overnight. No idea what happened as I've babied this panel whenever I took it off and it had no damage to it. only a couple months old. Kind of ridiculous and I had to deal with glass everywhere first thing in the morning, glass splinters and all.

Was super easy to put all my components inside it!

This case is phenomenal, an excellent purchase, white color gives you the opportunity to create something different from the conventional black case.Pros:-. Large size for a Mid-Tower.-. ATX plate fits perfectly without problem.-. Includes 3 Cooler Fan 120 Airflow ARGB, which generate a good airflow.-. Cable management is comfortable and with enough holes to pass them.-. Includes a mini hub to control the 3 Fan Cooler Included.-. Tempered glass is excellent with fractal details.-. Includes two internal bays for 2.5"" or 3.2"" drives.-. Supports 4 2.5"" drives installed on the back or front, using included rubber mounts.Cons:-. They only include rubber support to install two 2.5"" disks, if you want to install more you must locate some rubber bands similar to those included since they are not sold as accessories.-. The bottom mesh ( PSU ) comes off easily, does not have large fasteners and is not magnetic.Note : In my case I used 4 small neodymium magnets to hold the mesh securely.

Kane,5.0,2022 6 October,"
When i was looking for a case my criteria were mostly: cheap, chonky, and customizable. I was really trying to find one that could easily be taken apart for painting and this one was perfect! you can almost completely disassemble it! I was able to paint every part of it just the way i wanted to and it holds all the fans i wanted to put in it! you can get 3 fans on the top and front and one in the back : ) plenty of room for a 360 AIO and i think it holds maybe two or three of the big hard drives? the only place its lacking in space for me is where the cables go in the back, the back panel sits so close that im not able to get it on cause of how chunky my power supply cables are : ( other than that its absolutely perfect!
"
SSG Daley,4.0,2021 13 August,"
First off I'm not going to complain much considering we were looking for a cheap case with some fans. And that's what this is. The build quality is good but not stellar. It looks good and holds all we want. Probably the complaint is the fan RGB setup. They are connected to a push-button cool master controller that you cannot get outside the case. So you have to open the panel to click through the colors you want then put the glass back on. Pain in the butt. I would recommend undoing it all and going into the motherboard direct or get an RGB fan controller and plug them in that way. That's probably what we will do. Or buy a cheaper case and spend the difference on some good fans. But overall they run well, fast and quiet. It works as advertised. We had no sizing issues of installing components etc.

Absolutely beautiful! Sturdy, durable!I love the fans in front also ! It looks so pastel with the mesh ! Love love love !
"
Frank D.,5.0,2022 29 June,"
I came completely for the look of the case, it is beautiful. But here's some cons. First, the material can be better, I mean, just a magnetic duster on top is bad. Second, the back of the case can be a little more spacey, a thick cable for MB power can take up the whole space. And last but not least, it would be better if there's a plate for the motherboard connections. I have a prime z690 and there is a huge opening for my motherboard connection where something like hair or dust can easily get inside.

This case is roomy, easy to work in and has excellent cooling capability. Seller had it on the way immediately as a plus.Slapped a 360mm radiator in it and a behemoth RTX 3060 card inside. Really showroom glass build perfect for those spendy little light shows you bolt inside your P.C. I think I spend as much time staring @ P.C. as I do monitor.  More than I expected, Very clean nice build foundation.
"
Christopher McGill,5.0,2021 5 April,"
I needed something with a lot of room, it’s great. The fans it comes with are supper thin and cheap and are through aways, and the front ventilation is cheaply made. But other then that is perfect.

Matthew Perry,5.0,2022 21 February,"
I loved this case, keep in mind that you need to buy 3 extra fans. I had their liquid cooler so I just needed one extra fan and I was set!  great case.
"
Carmelo Ildefonso,5.0,2021 15 March,"
For $100, this is really one of the best and nicest looking airflow cases on the market. I've built three different PCs with this case and there are images of two of them here. It comes with three pre-installed ARGB fans and has plenty of room for all kinds of cooling possibilities. The front panel mesh and the magnetic dust filter on top keep this system nice and clean inside, and the engraved tinted glass side panel looks really nice with the right lighting, with plenty of room in the back panel for cable management and extra accessories. There's also a dust filter for the PSU that's a little hard to put on and keep in place, but once in place, does its job perfectly. Obviously it supports a ton of radiator space for liquid cooling and there's even a company that makes a custom distribution plate that I could have used here. It might not be mentioned a whole lot on Internet reviews but I think the TD500 Mesh is destined to be an instant classic for first-time liquid coolers and regular builders alike.

Lou Pell,5.0,2021 13 September,"
Buying a case for my new build was probably the hardest decision I had to make.  There are so many great cases out there, especially at this price point.  Ultimately, I went with the Cooler Master TD500 Mesh because it included 3 front intake ARGB fans but also because I really liked the look of it.  It wasn't over the top but had enough visual flair to make it look rugged and stylish all at the same time.  I love the tempered glass side-panel, and the mesh front looks fantastic while appearing to provide great airflow.  It is also a breeze to remove dust from the front of the case.  The underneath dust filter for the PSU leaves something to be desired however and is probably the worse thing about this case.  It is very flimsy and annoying to work with.  A magnetic dust cover would have been nice.  An included ARGB and PWM fan hub would have been nice also as I ordered one separately from Cooler Master.  It only cost me around 17 dollars though.  Overall, a great case and I am glad I went with it.  I would most definitely recommend it to anyone looking to build a quality PC but doesn't want to stretch their budget towards 150 or more.  I paid this case around 110.  I believe it should retail for around 100 dollars but I have seen it go for more online, even Amazon.

 Purchased 'Used - Very good' and the case was literally brand new - never used. That is what has me the most impressed. Though, the case is very nice as well. Came with controller which I was unsure whether I was going to receive or not. Only my second gaming case so I can't compare it to anything else. The quality is very nice. 10/10 overall thus far.EDIT: Still love the case, but it claims to be able to mount an AIO ""Up to 360"" on the top. Trying to mount an AIO on top will result in RAM and the radiator touching.

Couldn't get motherboard installed with radiator in case ram modules were too rall and heat sinks on an asus  maximus xiii were too  tall too, took radiator off installed motherboard then radiator fit although no clearance between fans and components, would have to completely disassemble to add memory case needs to be about 2 inches taller, even without radiator screw holes didn't line up well with case mounting points not conformining to ATX  form factor verywell. Would be an impresivecaseif this fit better

"
Emmanuel,5.0,2021 24 May,"
I got this tower after seeing how nice the case looks, did not disappoint! There is mesh everywhere! At the front, above, and below. So airflow is one of the best out there. Enough space in the case to support my 3090 as well. In the back it was also pretty easy to use for cable management, I wish there was a bit more space, but when compared to other cases, I can't complain. This also comes with 3 front case fans, but I threw those away to be replaced with some corsair ones instead. Highly recommend! Especially if you're a very strong believer in airflow

Color, quality and ease of use is fantastic. Cable management depends on how good the user does it and it has 3 more spots for system cooling fans.
"
D. Orders,5.0,2022 21 May,"
Really like this case. Some have said the power supply was blocked by the drive cages, which is true but they are not needed and easily removable. There are mounts for 2 SSD's in the main case and you might be using NVMe drives anyway. Some pluses, all the screw posts for a full size ATX board are already installed and every bit of hardware you might want is included. A couple very minor negs, no PC speaker is included (you can get a half dozen for less than $10) and the manual is tiny and hard to read (download the PDF copy which is easy to read and navigate). Last, while 3 front fans are included, there is ample room for 3 more on the top and one in the back that are not. Seems like in a full size ATX case at least the rear fan would be included.As noted in the title there are no front drive bays but with external DVD drives less than $20 and all software downloadable I'm not sure why you would want one.

 Un excelente case, hice upgrade de mi viejo case de poco más de 10 años en donde me era prácticamente imposible hacer algo de cable management. Con este case de Cooler Master fue sumamente sencillo hacerlo, trae todo lo necesario en accesorios para habilitar RGB y los ventiladores, tiene dos USB 3.1 frontales y HD audio, así como los botones de encendido y reinicio.Pase varios días viendo reseñas y todas decían cosas muy buenas de este modelo y por el precio se me hizo un win-win, la mejor reseña es la de Gamers Nexus.Por fin un build limpio sin cablerío en el frente :D!!El panel lateral de vidrio templado le da un aspecto increíble con las marcas que coinciden con el mesh frontal, el cuál es único y se ve genial.Es un deleite verlo en acción, además que la ventilación es increíble, solo venía con 3 ventiladores frontales RGB pero no tuve problema ya que contaba con 4 PWM Artic de 120 mm así que puse uno en la parte trasera y 3 arriba, debo decir que bajaron considerablemente mis temperaturas al jugar o minar bitcoins, unos 10 grados celcius en promedio.Llevo un par de semanas usándolo y debo decir que los filtros de polvo hacen un buen trabajo, recientemente tuve que abrirlo de nuevo para re acomodar los cables de la GPU (usaba 1 cable con adaptador de 2 salidas y decidí colocar 2 ya que mi GPU usa 2 de 8-pines c/u y vi que reducía el calor en el cable y mejoraba rendimiento) y el polvo dentro era prácticamente imperceptible, eso sí afuera si hay que estar limpiándolo constantemente, es un precio que pagar por una excelente ventilación.La fuente de poder se coloca en la parte de abajo y yo recomiendo que la coloquen con el ventilador hacia abajo, tiene mucho espacio, solo no pongan su computadora sobre una alfombra... cuenta con filtro de polvo en la parte de abajo también.El filtro de arriba es magnético así que es sumamente práctico y sencillo el proceso de limpieza, el del panel frontal se puede retirar con cierta facilidad para hacer mantenimiento también.Le puse 3 SSD SATA sin mayor problema, trae espacio para 4 pero también trae bahía para discos mecánicos que igual se pueden montar SSD ahí.Llegó antes de la fecha programada y en excelente estado.

Es un excelente gabinete.En cuanto al diseño es perfecta, todo está muy bien pensado para realizar un manejo de cables impecable, los slots de HDD y SSD son bastante prácticos. Y el espacio y tamaño es perfecto para incluir hasta una bomba de enfriamiento líquido costumizado.En cuando al producto por el exterior, es realmente bonito, el cristal templado y el material es de muy buena calidad lo que igualmente ayuda a tener una disipación correcta de calor.La regilla ""mesh"" de la parte fronal aporta mucha entrada de aire y lo mejor es que el equipo si está muy bien protegido del pelo y polvo.Actualmente tengo 2 mascotas y tenía que retirar pelo y polvo del equipo cada mes, ya que realmente se llenaba de conejos de pelo atascado, y ahora con este gabinete el pelo lo retiro solo de las regillas, ya que por el interior todo sigue bastante limpio.Por lo que es un muy buen agregado este frente ""mesh"" en comparación a la versión normal que tenía un cristar al frente.Quede muy feliz con mi compra.

My first build, done in 45 mins.This case is incredibly well designed, cable management is a breeze with it and everything aligned perfectly.Looks great too.Comes with the three fans in the front pre-installed and comes ready to plug straight into you MB.My only niggle is that is doesn't come with a rear exhaust fan, but I just picked another Cooler Master ARBG fan from Amazon, no drama, would have just been nice to be included.The glass - 4mm thick tempered glass! No worries of it being smashed easily like a lot of the cheap cases.For what it is, it's a great price. I would have happily paid 50% more for this.Definitely recommend

 Cercherò di descrive al meglio quelle che sono le mie impressioni ad una decina di giorni circa di utilizzo.Parto dicendo che la spedizione è stata abbastanza veloce ma questo credo dipenda più dal negozio che da altro.Dimensioni veramente generose per questo case, finalmente un case dove non si sia costretti a vedere il proprio hardware tutto striminzito in spazi angusti. Ce ne sono altri, certo, ma costano di più!!In questo case infatti è possibile montare in top un radiatore da 360mm, in effetti il mio è anche più lungo (400 mm ) e ci sta perfettamente. Vi posso assicurare che questa cosa non è affatto comune in case di questa fascia di prezzo.Trovo che il suo design sia assolutamente fantastico. La parte frontale con il suo motivo poligonale unita alle 3 ventole argb donano un look veramente accattivante.  Il pannello laterale in vetro temperato invece ha delle scanalature veramente ben fatte che danno un senso di movimento che onestamente apprezzo veramente tanto.  Chicca che ho apprezzato veramente tanto è il logo della casa in metallo sul frontale che ricade perfettamente nel centro della ventola posizionata in basso. Al tatto è stupendo questo logo.Il pannello frontale è dotato di due porte usb 3.0 un tasto reset due jack per cuffie e microfono ed il tasto di accensione esagonale bellissimo che il cui feedback alla pressione non mi piace affatto.Case che secondo me permette al flusso di aria di circolare perfettamente. Infatti a dispetto del mio vecchio case noto temperature più basse anche di 3 o 4 gradi.Questo case supporta schede madre di dimensioni ATX e mATX.Arriva dotato di un filtro magnetico anti-polvere sulla parte superiore ed uno non magnetico montato nella parte inferiore (dove si trova l’alimentatore) che trovo un po' scomodo ma nemmeno più di tanto dato che non ci si mette mani praticamente mai.Un’altra cosa che mi è piaciuta particolarmente di questo case è che le feritoie dalle quali passano i cavi provenienti dal retro sono dotati di copertura, cosa che trovo veramente carina e assolutamente inaccettabile che in case di questa fascia di prezzo non siano presenti ( cosa che accade fin troppo spesso).Nella parte inferiore della scheda madre i fori per far passare i cavi sono 2, posso assicurarvi che rendono il passare dei cavi molto agevole rispetto a case che ne hanno uno solo.Lo spazio sul retro è abbastanza ampio da permettere il passaggio dei cavi senza particolari difficoltà a patto che abbiate montato tutto con un minimo di attenzione.Sempre nel case troviamo un alloggio per 2 dischi di archiviazione compatibile con dischi sia da 2.5 che da 3.5 pollici. E’ ovviamente possibile montare altri dischi 2.5 pollici anche sulla parte posteriore del case.Le 3 ventole in dotazione, tutte argb e comandabili via software,  mi sembrano delle buone. Tutte pwm (4pin) molto silenziose a bassi e medi regimi e devo dire che spingono bene l’aria.Mi sarebbe piaciuto solamente che il vetro temperato fosse scuro, sarebbe stato veramente il top per me.Mi sento soddisfatto da questo acquisto e lo consiglio anche perché a questo prezzo (95 quando l’ho preso io) è difficile riuscire a trovare di meglio secondo me.Vi allego un po' di foto a fin che possiate giudicare voi stessi per quanto possibile farlo per mezzo di foto.Perdonatemi se non sono proprio di qualità eccellente però :(Se questa mia recensione vi è stata utile a chiarire qualche perplessità battetemi un like, è una cosa che mi fa piacere 😊

Attualmente ho dentro una 3080 TI e raffreddamento a liquido per la CPU. Essendo non molto alto ho dovuto mettere il radiatore dietro le ventole anteriori il che limita un po' l'airflow e il calore stagna un po' sotto la gpu che cmq sta a 70 gradi in 4k mentre la CPU sta attorno i 40. Esteticamente fa la sua figura e anche come solidità non c'è nulla da dire, è un ottimo prodotto.

I've read through the reviews and the negative comments referring to cheap build quality are mostly because of USER ERROR, its made in china...what do you expect for 130 bucks? you will strip/crossthread screws if you aren't careful, you must have a light touch, if these guys had experience working with tools, and tinkering, there would be no issues...I've encountered none so far, just note the chinese threads in the standoffs, like I said be gentleA 240mm rad fits perfectly on top, someone had an issue here and blamed it on the case... id confidently say that you can fit a 360mm up top as well...there is just enough room with my Z490 GE Wif and trident G skill DDR4, there are 3 concave rails running along the top of the case, 1 rail closest to the back cover is for 120 mm rads, the other 2 rails are for 240 and 360mms, it is a little tight to the fans however it fits fine, if anyone else has a problem its no big deal, get a file and remove enough material on the fan shroud for fitment, files work one way also don't put pressure on the backwards strokeAs for the stock fans, I did some quick research on reddit, cooler master sent an email to someone saying the fans aren't sold retail and its closest the MF120R A RGB, which you can get in a 3 pack.  some of the stock fans have been reported to have a ticking noise, some not, sometimes its a gamble with manufacturing. They are weak fans, so changing them out would be a good future upgradeOverall I like the case, cable management is a little roughEDIT 1: I assembled the case and managed the wires, minus the GPU because well you all know.., but it came out great cable management is a little rough but look at it this way, your next case will prob have better cable management so you'll be good at it, this is a good case for beginners who want a dope looking case that has good coolingTIPS: -try to avoid zip/cable ties, use twist ties or Velcro straps your pc doesn't go down the road lol-USE PC PART PICKER.COM (top right corner switch to Canada)EDIT 2: Oct 2nd 2021spec list-MB- MSI z490 GE WIFIRAM- 16gb trident G skill RGB CL-16 3200AIO- H100x corsair ""240mm"" (skinnier than real 240mm)SSD- Samsung QVO 1TBCPU- I5-10600KFGPU- 3060 Zotac twin edgeDuring a CPU stress test at 100% usage max temp was 60 C, on idle its about 29 CGPU on idle runs 28 C with 1320 rpm (60%) fan speedThe front case fans are ok, no noises, but I can tell they are weak

Amaki,2.0,2020 6 September,"
Pros:1> The airflow is decent and coming with 3 front fans is really nice.2> The RGB comes with adapters for the different types. Only preset patterns though.3> Big and fits all the common parts properly. 320mm GPU fits quite easily. No comment on radiator support since I don't use those.Cons:1> The screws aren't well made to size and about 70% of them were really difficult to screw into the motherboard standoff screws.At one point, my case was rattling when I turned it on and after a lot of troubleshooting, I found out that I hadn't screwed in one of the motherboard screws all the way. You might think that's just my mistake, but this happened because it was extremely tough to tighten the screw further than I had already screwed in. I seriously doubt I'll be getting that screw out later without the motherboard standoff coming off with it.2> The front panel feels a bit cheap and is not completely tight so it creaks when you push it around a bit.3> Some of the motherboard standoff screws were over/under tightened. Some just weren't tightened enough so I just tightened them myself and that fixed that. However, 2 of them would spin in their hole when you tried to put a screw in them, so I had to hold them in place with pliers while unscrewing to get the screw out of it. Luckily, they were on the side with space beside the motherboard, otherwise I might not have been able to remove the motherboard without breaking something.4> As noted in Gamers Nexus' review on Youtube, the bottom front fan doesn't use normal fan screws so it was extremely difficult to replace it with a third-party fan.I would not recommend this case over the similarly priced Phanteks P400A RGB. It's actually unbelievable how much better built the Phanteks case feels in comparison to this Cooler Master case.

Snake_Train,4.0,2020 17 November,"
Pros:- Fairly sturdy- 3 included (rgb) fans- Three dust filters (including removable front panel)- Decent room for cables and routing in the back of the case- Mounts for 4 SSD and 2 HDD (or 6 SSD)- Option to remove HDD tray to allow more room for longer PSUCons:- Top radiator support is iffy unless mounting a 120mm cooler, minimal space between top of motherboard and ceiling of case- Bottom PSU dust filter is cheap and easy to damage- My case came with two motherboard standoffs already stripped, had to replace themOverall my experience has been great and I personally love the looks of this case and I think the price is definitely worth what you get. Mounted my 240mm rad in the front due to the struggle of space up top.

Me gustó mucho éste gabinete porque tiene una  excelente ventilación, cuenta con 2 compartimentos para guardar todo el cablerío, uno en el lateral y otro abajo en donde va la fuente de poder además de una ventana en la parte del procesador que facilita mucho instalar un enfriamiento líquido o de torre.Es muy espacioso, ya incluye 3 ventiladores con rgb en el panel frontal y tiene espacio hasta para un radiador de 3 ventiladores en la parte de arriba y otro ventilador más en la parte de atrás.Para conectar el rgb de los ventiladores lo puedes hacer de 2 maneras, conectarlos directamente a tu motherboard y controlar la iluminación por software o mediante Sata y un control que viene incluído así que no te preocupes si tu motherboard no tiene las tecnologías Aura Sinc o cualquiera de esas tecnologías que sirven para controlar el rgb porque de todas maneras lo puedes conectar sin problema.Tiene además ventana de acrílico para lucir los componentes y el corte diamante con el que está diseñado el gabinete lo hace ver muy pro 😁

Tutto sommato un ottimo mid-tower capace di assecondare più o meno tutte le esigenze.Dopo due giorni passati a provare varie configurazioni hardware, queste sono le mie conclusioni:PRO:- Design accativante e discreto allo stesso tempo- Buona qualità dei materiali, ho avuto case decisamente più costosi ma con materiali di qualità nettamente inferiore- Il pannello laterale in vetro temperato offre un ottima vista dell'interno ed è molto comodo da rimuovere- Arriva fornito di tre ventole RGB- Nonostante sia un mid-tower, è possibile montare un radiatore da 360mm, sia nella parte superiore che dietro al pannello frontale- Non ci sono problemi di spazio per quanto riguarda l'installazione della scheda video- Gli alloggi delle memorie di massa, situati sul retro del case e nella cover del PSU, aiutano a mantenere un interno molto ordinato- Il design semplice e compatto favorisce un ottimo airflow- prezzo molto interessante per quello che offreCONTRO:- Le ventole sono un capellino rumorose- Montando un radiatore da 360mm nella parte superiore, non resta spazio per una ventola sul retro- Non penso sia possibile montare un radiatore più spesso di 30mm nella parte superiore, il mio deep cool castle 360 v2 entra preciso- Ottimo per i dissipatori AIO ma alcuni dissipatori ad aria potrebbero essere troppo alti- lo spazio per alloggiare i cavi nel comparto laterale è appena sufficente e in gerenale le soluzioni per organizzare i cavi potrebbero essere migliori- la cover del PSU è molto bella ma poco pratica e spaziosa, l'installazione dell'alimentatore può risultaredifficoltosa- Non c'è spazio per PSU particolarmente lunghi, il mio corsair RM850x ci sta preciso. E' comunque possibile sacrificare gli alloggi degli hard disk per fare spazio- la cover del PSU ha delle asole dal quale è possibile far passare i connettori audio, USB e dei pulsanti di accensione e reset del pannello frontale. risultano tuttavia poco pratiche a causa del poco spazio disponibile nell'alloggio del PSU- Il pulsante di accensione e l'ingresso per i jack audio/mic non sembrano di ottima qualità, tuttavia, collegando l'headset, non ho riscontrato disturbi sgradevoli nel segnale audio come di solito succede.- I filtri antipolvere sono un po' ridicoli, ma per questo prezzo non lo reputo un problema :)Conclusioni:Il TD500 Mesh di Cooler Master è decisamente un case che punta a soddisfare qualsiasi necessità di una build di livello intermedio, sia a livello pratico che estetico, e riesce a proporsi ad un prezzo interessante riuscendo a puntare sulle caratteristiche importanti, trascurando invece dettagli di secondaria importanza.

Ashley Hinds,5.0,2021 30 May,"
I bought a white one ~6mths ago for my daughter's fancy pants ARGB on the cheap(ish) build and I liked it that much I bought another for myself, in black this time.It was a pleasure to build in with plenty of cable management tie down points, though I had to supply my own velcro ties or zip ties - some more expensive cases come with that but we are talking the cheaper end of the actually worth buying cases here so you can't have everything.Compared to the little Coolermaster N200 I was using before, with every fan slot populated mind you including an old school side GPU intake, my CPU peak temps dropped ~5c and my GPU temps dropped closer to 10c! All from those 3x 120mm stock ARGB fans up the front, plus another 120mm fan I added into in the CPU exhaust position.  If you go a top mounted AIO you wouldn't even need that, with the stock front fans on intake and the top mounted AIO fans on exhaust.Both of my builds are all air cooled, but the case does support a 360mm rad up top where they are most efficient, or in the front if you prefer (not sure if both at once are possible for open loops or if the tanks and/or fans would be in the way of each other with 2x 360mm rads - do your own research and watch motherboard VRM/IO panel cover clearances for top mounted rads)The same chassis is available with the older 12V 4 pin DRGB as well for a cost saving if you don't care about the pretty lights, but if you want the proper unicorn spew the two I bought are the newer 3 pin 5V ARGB variant.The ARGB variant comes with a little ARGB controller and enough splitters to run the stock fans only.  The actual 3 pin fans have a 3 way splittler supplied to require only a single mobo header.Unfortunately the little ARGB controller doesn't have the ability to plug into the motherboard for pass through control for total flexibility like some of the higher model ARGB controllers, but instead you can connect the reset switch to the ARGB controller to switch modes easily without needing to open the case.There is also a newer model apparently that has 4 pin PWN fans instead of the older 3 pin variants this case has, though obviously that model is higher priced again.All in all, a highly recommended chassis with a different colour and supplied fan options to choose from.If you're looking in the $100-150AUD range for an ATX case with good airflow, this should be on your short list.

D. Patton,4.0,2021 28 January,"
Case looks great. The plastic front doesn’t look plastic at all and has a nice matte finish. Case has lots of clearance. I don’t have AIO as I’m air cooled, but looks to be ample clearance on the front panel and likely just enough up top. Fans are reasonably quiet but as with most cases, not a flagship model.I put CM sickle flow fans on the front and moved stock to back. I’m pleased with how quiet despite the venting. Only gripe is clearance in back of case tested my poor cable management skills. You have to be on cable management right away as there isn’t a big margin for error. My other grip is the coolermaster controllers are not great. Just daisy chain and hook up to argb header if you have it. If not, I hope you have better luck than I did. I tried the controller out of curiosity and the software wouldn’t detect.... at all... period.

Glenn Collier,5.0,2020 2 August,"
What’s not to love about this case!  Gamer Nexus gave it great reviews and it doesn’t disappoint.  Lots of room inside to work, lots of radiator mounting options, and that glass side panel, WOW it that thing heavy!  I just LOVE the lip on the bottom that holds it to the case, only need the two top screws to hold it securely.  The mesh front looks stunning and gives great airflow.  I changed out the 3 RGB fans for something NON- RGB as that was the look I was going for.  Amazing case, best investment in my system so far.
"
Eric,1.0,2020 11 August,"
BeWare, this case will not fit any 360 AIO with FANs especially those from NZXT. There is not enough clearance from the motherboard Memory (DDR) memory slots for the fans. I bought it because it stated it works with 360mm radiators; although a radiator on its own will fit if you have a custom water loop it will not fit with any 360mm AIO. And thats trying it at the highest possible position in the installation to the left of the case towards the glass.

 It was my first time building a pc on my own and only relied on what I know. But this case is straight forward. I like everything about it especially the mesh parts and the crystal tempered glass.

Came with stripped motherboard stand-off so couldn’t properly secure motherboard. Include RGB header was shorted and when plugged in the LEDs in the fans all shorted out. When asked to return they would only issue a refund once it was back in possession (but I needed a computer case) so kept the piece of junk. Now with shorter headers it’s been at Canada Computers for a month. HORRIBLE experience and HORRIBLE customer service. Wish I never bought it. Very defeating PC build all because of a case and their unwillingness to help

Ganinete elegante com ótimo fluxo de ar. As fans que acompanham o gabinete, possuem boa performance e com baixo ruído. Estou muito satisfeito com a aquisição. O preço hoje é relativamente caro, muito por conta da alta do dólar e escassez de hardware durante a pandemia, com isso, os valores subiram absurdamente. Mas recomendo bastante por conta da qualidade de construção e pelo airflow.
"
Kalyana,3.0,2020 27 December,"
Beautiful cabinet with good airflow, not excellent but very good airflow.Pros: very beautiful, I got white case because black is 1000 Rs more when I got it which I think is just stupid. But if you can get the black one it would be much better looking and white is bound to get stains and such. Airflow is good. 3 front fans are giving good airflow. CM even gives separate RGB controller incase the motherboard doesn't support RGB or you like a separate controller which is good. I didn't use the controller and plugged it to my Asus motherboard. ASUS, MSI, ASRock follow one type of RGB header and Gigabyte follows another. The case supports both. There are 2 racks given for the standard 3.5 inch SATA HDDs which is at the bottom front, in front of the PSU. This can be removed to give higher ventilation and better space for wires. I removed it and highly recommend doing so, it makes wiring much easier.Cons:1. The product description is misleading. It says 120mm, 240mm, 360mm radiators can be mounted on top and 120mm, 140mm, 240mm, 280mm, 360mm on top.120mm variants, 240mm and 360mm will fit on top but before buying a verify as it may hit any heat shroud your motherboard may have on top especially 360mm one as the length of the radiator may exceed the length of the case or can be hard fit. 360mm means there are 3 x 120mm fans, obviously the plastic around it increases the length a bit, same for width but length varies the most among manufacturers and models. Also discount 1 or 1.5 cm on case length as there are the front panel wires going at the top front and they may be a little obstructive for 360mm rad.So for the top a 240mm Rad is the best bet, all other do proper research on exact dimensions before buying.For the front, its spacier with no obstructions for the radiator except on the bottom if you are going to use 360mm. When front mounting a radiator the pump intake outtake, the pipes should be on the bottom. For 360mm radiator the power shroud on the bottom which extends a good length to the front of the case creates obstruction for the pipes as 360mm radiator will go the bottom most of the case. You can avoid this by mounting with pipes on top but it decreases efficiency and also decreases life of the cooler.All in all, a 240mm rad is recommended for the top, research on exact dimensions with your motherboard heights accounted, with ram sticks, heat shrouds etc if you want to use a 360mm rad.For the front a 280mm is recommended. If you want 360mm research a little if the radiator pipes are flexible enough to bend at almost 80 to 90 degrees. All high end AIO coolers come with braided pipes which make them not so flexible. Plain plastic/rubberish pipes though cheap looking and prone to damage by becoming brittle are more flexible than hard braided ones. Thats something to consider if you are dead set on 360mm rad on the front.2. There is no back side chassis fan, which I think should have been definitely been given this is a budget case. I got a deepcool 120mm fan for it and definitely recommend adding a back side chassis fan. Saw 4 degree temperature drop after adding it.3. May be with my case but the third fan (bottom most) is making little noise. Overall case is not so silent and you can hear it, a bit annoying.4. The fans themselves are DC fans and not PWM fans.5. The space available for cable management is not good. It's somewhat tight, if you don't do it properly there will be a bulge, but cables are guaranteed to be touching the back cover. This has always been my issue with CM cases, a 1 cm extra space would have been great.Personal Opinion:1. The power button is a hard tactile button, I would have preferred a soft tactile button.2. Reset button is very small, and cannot be accidentally be pressed, which is really thoughtful.Overall a beautiful and good case though the case fan noise is a bit of an issue for me. Especially because of the one loud fan it's become a bit annoying. If it persists may replace it. Also it a a bit overpriced in India, you will feel it.

aazxianar,3.0,2021 12 May,"
The stock fans are NOT adressable RGB. They are static and dont get detected by cooler master software. The bottom stock fan is attatched via plastic pins (not screws). this doesnt hold the fan steady and when ramping up, makes LOTS of noise and vibrates the case heavily. There's also no control for the fans (stock) and so the fans will slow down and ramp up very frequently.The bottom fan i had to remove because it was too much of a nuisance. Unforunately i didnt spec the dimensions right and mounted my 360mm corsair radiator at the top of the case. This meant i had to take the middle fan out for RAM clearance. I tried installing said middle AIO fan to the front of the case where the pinned stock fan was. The holes on the case are made specifically for coolermaster fans and so my screws (nor backup screws for the stock fans) would allow me to screw my remaining AIO fan in.All up, this case is impressive for air cooling your components. It is easy to access and easy to clean dust filters. I would recommend a different case if you want more than 2 stock fans or ARGB. The back of the case doesnt have much room for bigger cables and doesnt have many tie down points. Its a struggle to get on if you have a lot of wiring in the back.

Making a build in it was such a joy, with many places to put your cables through, Clean look.It brings three RGB fans that look nice, Are not that powerful but keep it silent.The glass is really nice, just be careful not to break it lol

Vivian,5.0,2020 17 November,"
I used this tower for my first computer built so my review might be a little bit inexperienced. There are a lot of options to have for cable management. Opening on the side and underneath. Cable management from the power supply was rather hard, but I had the cables secured before putting it inside the case.I had a slight mishap with the case and had to communicate with customer service. They were super understanding and helpful!

Paul Carter,5.0,2020 4 September,"
I really like this tower. I have 7 fans in it and it keeps temps low. Front fans it comes with are quiet (I turn off the lights).Easy to build and the best cable routing I've built. Easy to make a nice clean build with almost no visible wires.With the lights off it looks cool but not 'too cool'?

I've had this case for a few months now. The aesthetics are nice alongside easy access points. The fans though are a complete dealbreaker, they are insanely noisy and make it sound like your pc is in a tunnel, definitely need to replace them which destroys a significant amount of value for this caseI could not recommend this case to anyone because of this, seems like a common issue.

it's a great mid-tower lot of airflow  and easy to install I built my first PC in here and it was very easy and great routing areas for cables, one thing I wish the back was a bit bigger for more space fro cable management cause Im bad at it lol

Skyler,1.0,2020 11 December,"
Overall the case is good but as long as u don’t have my luck and the headphone and mic jack are broken your good.  I can’t even return and get a new one cause I already built the PC and I would have to take out everything and wait to use it again when they send another one .

Bought this case it’s my first time building a computer (my first pc). Everything came together super easy I got lost tying to plug in the RGB fans in the front but got it, has lots of space and recommend this case to anyone.

Well.. I ordered a white case but got a black one.  Good thing is that my son likes it......which is important because it's for his gaming build.  All around happy even though it should have been the white case.

Box was a bit smaller than I thought, and I had to switch out the fans. Everything fit though, and it looks great. We burned out the fan speed control piece as soon as we started it up, but it was meant for the prepackaged fans.

does what its supposed to. only downside the RGB fans if hooked up to the controller it comes with does not have solid colors. you can choose many different colors but they have the pulse effect.

YUN,5.0,2020 2 December,"
it will  look exactly like what it looks like in the photo, which is amazing. amazing air flow and super spacey. it's just that it is a bit more costly than the there cases, but definitely worth the money.

Muy buen gabinete, del tamaño justo sin caer en excesivo ya que le caben perfectamente 2 radiadores de 240mm y deja espacio incluso para poder hacer un set up frontal push-pull (ventilador - radiador ventilador), se le puede instalar una RTX 3090 sin ningún inconveniente, tiene espacio de sobra.Desafortunadamente la distribución de espacio en la zona superior deja un poco que desear, ya que mis ventiladores del radiador toparon con las memorias, problema que no tuve con mi gabinete anterior, con esta condición no puedo instalarle otras 2 memorias teniendo el ventilador instalado ya que toparian a un grado que pudiera dañar las memorias o los slots de la motherboard. Recomiendo comprar memorias de perfil bajo si se desea poner un radiador en la zona superior.El gabinete es muy amplio, aunque siento que se pudo haber aprovechado mejor el espacio, ya que queda una zona muerta en la zona inferior frontal que si bien es para habilitar un radiador de 360mm frontal, yo no lo haría porque por el espacio y geometría del gabinete te obliga a instalar el radiador con la orientación de las mangueras hacia arriba (si se ponen abajo se forzan demasiado con las paredes del gabinete), cosa que no es muy recomendable en un AIO por el tema de las burbujas de aire.Estéticamente está genial, tiene muy buenos acabados en el mesh frontal y el cristal templado el cual tiene líneas de expresión que simulan continuidad a la geometría de la tapa frontal.Un plus para mi fue que las rejas traseras son desmontables y no la típica rejilla que tienes que romper para darle espacio a las conexiones de la GPU, por lo que si un día retiro la GPU puedo instalar nuevamente las rejillas, evitando que quede el agujero horrible atrás.El montaje del vidrio templado es bueno, sin ser extraordinario. No es de bisagras como los gabinetes de gama alta, es de montaje frontal es decir que los tornillos se aseguran al costado del gabinete en lugar de en la parte trasera al estilo de la tapa del cableado del otro costado. Cuenta con un bracket bastante largo en la zona inferior el cual se engancha al gabinete y asegura al cristal templado, lo cual asegura que no se caiga o deslice hacia abajo evitando que se pueda romper de esa manera, como normalmente ocurre con los cristales de instalación con tornillos en la parte trasera. Los tornillos cuentan con un par de gomas que impiden el. Contacto directo del cristal con el metal del gabinete, lo cual ayuda a reducir esfuerzos residuales en el cristal y lo protege de vibraciones.El gabinete cuenta con 3 ventiladores frontales de 120 mm los cuales son buenos y tienen un rgb bastante llamativo compatible con Aura Sync.En la parte inferior junto al espacio para la PSU tiene una estructura para colocar HDDs y SSDs adicionales la cual es removible, en mi caso eso es un muy buen plus porque por las características de mi setup tengo una cantidad ridícula de cables y ese espacio extra me ayudó a poder acomodar todos el exceso de cables sin ningún problema.En conclusión es un muy buen gabinete por su costo, tiene algunos aspectos a mejorar como su distribución de espacios pero son temas muy específicos de cada set up.

El gabinete por si es bueno, por su costo es bastante grande y bueno, sin embargo desde el inicio uno de los ventiladores suena un poco mal, tal vez solo debo ajustarlo pero si es con todos entonces no es un muy buen detalle

C,2.0,2022 12 March,"
I've just assembled my pc and after a week of usage the fans are making noises loud enough to be annoying. There would be some weird sounds coming from them; So I turn computer off, fidget with the fans to see if wires are caught and turn on computer again, the noise would disappear. On a different day, the annoying sound comes back again. If I didn't have issues with the fan, it would be a decent case for the price.

Caja de PC súper TOP que me ha encantado en casi todos los sentidos.El cristal templado es de una gran calidad y tiene dos líneas a modo de decoración, además que solo necesita de dos tornillos grandes para acoplarse al chasis. Es realmente espaciosa y me cabe una 3070ti de 3 ventiladores sin problemas, además de un gran disipador. El flujo de aire de serie es correcto aunque lo puedes ajustar. Es una pena que solo incluya 3 ventiladores, podrían haber puesto uno extra en la parte de atrás para sacar el aire.En la parte de arriba trae un gran filtro anti polvo magnético que funciona realmente bien. Además del mallado de la parte delantera en los 3 ventiladores.Como única pega que le pongo en el control de los LED de los ventiladores. Incluye un mando que no es a distancia sino que se queda dentro de la caja por tanto si en algún momento quiero apagarlos no puedo hacerlo y tendría que abrir el pc para hacerlo, o simplemente para cambiar el modo de iluminación es algo que no me gusta nada y no entiendo porque no me reconoce el programa, será para que compre el controlador propio de cooler master el cual no se incluye en la caja.Pese a esto me encanta por estética, calidad y gestión de cableado, muy contento con ella y la recomiendo sin ninguna duda. Espero que te resulte útil.

Cercavo un case con una buona aerazione e bello esteticamente e il td500 mesh mi è sembrato un ottimo compromesso tra le due qualità.Provengo da un Cooler Master Haf-x 942, un full-tower assemblato nel 2014 che pecca in estetica a vantaggio dell'insieme di periferiche che si possono installare e del flusso d'aria.Farò un paragone tra i due e di come mi sono trovato personalmente durante l'assemblaggio del TD500 mesh.- Estetica: tra i due non c'è paragone, il TD500 è superiore rispetto all'Haf-x, l'illuminazione RGB dei componenti è premiata dalla presenza del pannello laterale in vetro temperato. Inizialmente ero scettico anche sulla resa degli RGB delle 3 ventole frontali, ma una volta accesa la macchina mi sono dovuto ricredere.- Assemblaggio: per entrambi l'assemblaggio dei soli componenti è risultato semplice, è importante che si verifichi quali siano i vincoli sulle dimensioni dei componenti, dato che parliamo di un case con spazio ridotto rispetto ad un full-tower.- Cable management: complesso, ma buono. Questa è una caratteristica che immagino sia generalmente condivisa tra tutti i mid-tower, quindi non prendetela mirata unicamente al TD500 mesh. Avendo meno spazio di un full-tower in cui disporsse i vari cavi di alimentazione e collegamenti sulla scheda madre la loro disposizione va decisa con più attenzione per poi essere in grado di chiudere il pannello laterale.Comunque, il TD500 dispone di diversi punti dove poter applicare delle fascette per far are i cavi e renderli ordinati. È complesso, ma non impossibile.- Disposizione: molto buona. Essendo un case più compatto è leggero del Haf-x che senza componenti interni pesa ben 15Kg, è possibile posizionarlo anche sopra la scrivania senza problemi.- Rumore: silenzioso. Ritenevo che il mio l'Haf-x fosse un case silenzioso, ma il td500 mesh lo è ancora di più.In generale lo ritengo un buonissimo case per chi ne cerchi uno con buona aerazione, estetica e bassa rumorosità con le ventole preinstallate.

è comodo con l'apertura laterale in vetro temprato con 2 sole viti, essendo mesh aspira un po' da tutte le parti e ovviamente accumula anche un po' più polvere dalle bocchette (anche se ci sono i filtri magnetici) alcuni sono un po' fastidiosi perchè appena li tocchi si sganciano
"
Angelo G.,3.0,2021 15 March,"
Reso ma andiamo con ordine; il case è bello ma a questo prezzo, 98 euro al momento dell’acquisto, si prende altro in relazione alla costruzione e tante altre piccole o grandi cose, dipende dal punto di vista.La maglia in mesh è bella, particolare, si può perfino smontare interamente e pulire se serve ma sopra di questa i pulsanti accensione e reset/comando led, sono molli.. sarà una sciocchezza ma danno l’impressione di non durare a lungo, forse è meno evidente sul reset/comando led ma l’altro….In top lo spazio non manca ma dietro per i cavi mi sarei aspettato di più, può essere che sia io incapace o prevenuto da esperienze con altri case ma anche mezzo centimetro in più avrebbe fatto comodo. Secondo me gli spazi andrebbero calcolati a carico massimo, mi spiego meglio, se ci possono entrare 2 hdd da 3.5 e 2 hdd/ssd da 2.5 ecc ecc lo devi prevedere.Ok ci sono gli nvme e ok, non è un case per dedito a server però.. per chi sa che di spazio per questi ce n’è non vedo perché non montarli se si hanno!Ci sono 3 ventole, argb con sdoppiatore ma niente fanhub se non un controller per gestire i led. In espulsione la ventola non è presente!Il vetro è buono, spesso, le linee geometriche non sono brutte visivamente, non mi dispiacciono ma devono piacere, a volte un vetro semplice può stancare. Il meccanismo di aggancio dello stesso, però, non mi convince molto; è comodo perché si sgancia velocemente ma non ci sono ne magneti o gomme sul perimetro, solo due guarnizioni che vanno fra il telaio e il vetro per poi agganciarsi con due vitine.Degni di nota sono i le gomme nelle asole passacavi (peccato non ci siano anche sotto per gli spazi fra scheda madre e alimentatore), i carrelli per gli hardisk da 3.5 che allargano per un montaggio veloce, gomme e viti per gli hd da 2.5 da posizionare davanti o dietro la scheda madre con attacco/stacco veloce.La marca non giustifica il costo in questo caso, ci sono piccole lacune o disattenzioni che non mi sarei aspettato. Oppure si poteva aumentare anche il prezzo di qualche euro ma far caso a due o tre dettagli che avrebbero fatto di questo case il re indiscusso della fascia. In ultimo, forse è la mia impressione, la lamiera è leggerissimamente meno spessa della media.. o forse è qualcosa di imputabile alla costruzione, magari mi sbaglio. In conclusione per un modello rivolto all’airflow non metti la ventola in espulsione, eh Coolermaster? Qualche griglia di areazione lateralmente ci stava per prendere più aria da fuori o la possibilità di posizionare una o due ventole stile Antec-Flux!Compratelo, per carità, ma per 100 euro non ci sta. Solo e se cala un bel po’ di prezzo, a quel punto è un affare

 Per me davvero un case eccellente, bello, robusto, con un vetro temperato di ottima qualità , addirittura con delle incisioni, che contribuiscono a renderlo più aggressivo, nel caso della mia versione sono parenti già di fabbrica 3 ventole argb, con relativo controller( ma pilotabili anche separatamente), bello e pratico  il sistema di cable management, e soprattutto tanto spazio al suo interno! L'alimentatore è separato da una copertura, che lo nasconde, ma ne fa trapelare il logo, possibilità di installare nascosti due hhd da 3,5 sempre ben nascosti appunto dalla copertura inferiore, e quattro slot SSD: 2 sono a vista, e due nel retro, proprio dietro la scheda madre. Presente oltretutto un filtro superiore magnetico davvero pratico, e uno inferiore ad incastro a proteggere l'alimentatore, ah dimenticavo, può ospitare qualsiasi sistema di raffreddamento,120mm, 240mm, 280mm, 360mm... Scegliete voi.... Note negative?Mah più che altro un consiglio, e cioè quello di effettuere da subito un buon cable management, dato che poi il pannello laterale della mobo andrà a nascondere il tutto, rendendo come nel mio caso, un po' difficoltosa la chiusura, che dire... Buon acquisto e buon assemblaggio, ciao!!!Grazie Amazon che come al solito me l'ha consegnato nel giro di 24 ore ...

Lo scrivo subito: Un noctua NH-D15 (quello con due ventole) ci entra per meno di un millimetro, più precisamente:La mia build è composta da mobo X570 Aorus Elite, montando il dh-15 , la ventola in posizione push causa un problema: lo spazio rimanente fino al vetro è minore di un millimetro, o forse tocca proprio con il vetro, quindi:NON ADATTO PER UNA X570 + Noctua nh-d15; Probabilmente con una mobo di generazione precedente si riesce a montarlo, ma nulla di certo.Piccola info: Un noctua nh-d15 con una sola ventola (esiste in questa configurazione per l'acquisto, si chiama nh-d15-S) riesce a tenere a bada un ryzen 3950x sotto full carico, quindi magari chiedetevi se vi serve un nh-d15 se montate processori più calmi :DPassando al case, è ottimo in tutto, ottima qualità costruttiva, super facile fare il cable management con le fascette e veltri inclusi, buono lo spazio per il PSU e cavi di alimentazione anche con la cage per hdd montata.Il controller rgb pwm che vi danno in dotazione non vi permette di avere le ventole con un illuminazione fissa, potete scegliere vari colori ma saranno sempre con un motivo ad intermittenza (abbastanza lento almeno) . L'unica colorazione che rimane sempre accesa è arcobaleno.Un bel 4.5 su 5 per quanto mi riguarda.

got the case, it is as you expect - a great looking case with 3 okay fans.Mine initially came with a couple of broken clips on the front panel (I assume it was a returned product) - contacted the seller and they immediately worked on sending out a replacement front panel - they're amazing, keep you up to date on every step of the process and will ensure you're satisfied with your purchase.Other than that minor issue, the case itself was perfect, not a single scratch or imperfection on the glass or body.almost a year later and the case is still perfect (not really one of those products that goes downhill with time but you get the point), still loving it. Would recommend =)

Gunjan,5.0,2020 29 June,"
This is a detailed review of the Cooler Master TD500 Mesh PC Case>>Packaging: The case arrived well packaged it its original box. However, the box had been opened previously, because it contained additional packaging material (scrap paper) inside the actual product box. The case arrived in a dusty condition, and judging by the few scuff marks on the product, I can reasonably believe that it was previously unboxed. The product works fine, so I did not return it.>>Build Quality/Design: This case is one of the best designed cases available in the market. The front mesh has a 3D pattern, reminiscent to that of the Fractal Design Meshify C, and I really like it, mainly because it does not restrict airflow. The tempered glass also has an etched design, which is very unique. The fan support is awesome, and you can also do some custom water cooling in it. The front cover is easy to remove, and the front IO is actually attached to the frame rather than the front panel, which makes regular maintainance really easy. Both the front USB ports are USB 3.0, which is nice.  However, one of the downsides is the PSU shroud. It does not cover the entire length of the case, as a result of which there is very little clearence between the PSU and the hard-drive bay. The HDD Bays are removable, but you will have to remove them probably if you use a longer/ modular PSU. Also, the cutout on the shroud is very big, and so you can actually see the rat's nest of cables behind my smaller VS650 PSU.>>Included Hardware: Aside from the case, you also get 3 ARGB Fans in the front. However, the fans are 3-Pin ones, which means that they are not PWM and you won't be able to control their speed, unless you have a Motherboard that supports Voltage Control for fans. The fans come with all the required splitters for power and ARGB, and are compatible with the common ARGB standards. It also comes with a ARGB controller, however it has very limited customisation. Also, at this price, a 4th fan at the rear exhaust was expected.>>Conclusion: Overall, this is a very good looking case from Cooler Master with great airflow and hardware compatibility at a reasonable price. Definitely recommended.

Amazon Kunde,3.0,2021 17 May,"
Heute endlich aus Italien nach fast 7 Tagen angekommen.. Amazon könnte ruhig deutlich zeigen aus welchem Lager sie ihre Produkte verschicken 😑 ! Aber gut nun zum Produkt ich habe es sofort zusammengebaut und muss sagen das Gehäuse ist in echt einfach doppelt so schön als auf den Bildern. Ich hab in einem case noch nie so einen guten airflow gesehen bzw gespürt wenn ich auf dem Bett liege (steht ca 1 Meter vom PC entfernt ) spüre ich selbst da immer wieder einen kühlen Hauch der vom PC kommt! Ich hatte nach dem ersten Start die Tastatur oben drauf abgelegt und da spürte man den airflow sehr auf dem Bett da kann man sich ja fast den Ventilator im sommer sparen .😆 die Lüfter sind angenehm leise und meine Skepsis bezüglich der Lautstärke war schnell verflogen , eine ps4 ist gefühlt 10 mal so laut die übertönt den PC komplett bei mir .. Die rgbs zaubern auf meinen (noch) alten Board schöne Effekte demnächst mit nem neuem Board und 3 pin argb Anschluss sicherlich noch besser! Hinten ist sehr viel Spielraum für kabelmanagement, trotzdem war ich sehr froh ein vollmodulares netzteil zu haben.. Es wurde dann doch schon recht eng hinter dem Netzteil um alles dort zu verstecken. Das Gehäuse ist fast rundum perfekt. Nun zu dem Punkt warum es nicht 5 Sterne geworden sind! Als ich mit dem zusammenbauen fertig war und mich in dieses Gehäuse von Sekunde zu Sekunde mehr verliebte , merkte ich beim zurecht rücken das mein Gehäuse extrem kippelt 🤦🏻‍♂️ es ist das erste mal das ich sehe das ein Gehäuse kippelt und dann auch noch so extrem, dass es erst besser wird wenn ich unter einem der Beine ein usb Kabel lege was gute 5 mm dick ist 😑 ich werde es trotzdem behalten, da ich es erst nach dem Zusammenbau gemerkt habe und höchstwahrscheinlich ein Stück selbstklebenden Filz oder so drunter klebe ..aber trotzdem bei so einem schicken in meinen augen fast perfekten Gehäuse wieso muss es an den Füßen scheitern ?! Ein weiterer minus Punkt in meinen Augen war die kompatibilität mit einem micro atx Board die unteren 2 schrauben hängen bei mir in der Luft ..Nichts desto trotz bin ich sehr zufrieden ich werd da ja nicht die ganze zeit dran rumwackeln und ich plane eh demnächst ein atx Board zu verbauen von daher alles in meinem fall halb so wild.. der preis ist auch völlig in ordnung wenn man bedenkt was man erhält. ich hab es reduziert für 85 euro gekauft und wenn man bedenkt das man hier ein dickes Glas Seitenteil hat 3 rgb lüfter über die man auf keinen Fall meckern kann und perfekten airflow mit staubfiltern überall wo man sie braucht. Wegen den Füßen hätte es ruhig ein tick günstiger sein können, vielleicht aber auch einfach 5 Euro teurer mit gescheiten Füßen 😉aber vielleicht war esauch einfach nur bei meinem case so und ich hatte pech.

Pazagor,4.0,2021 29 June,"
Case molto bello esteticamente a mio parere, la forma del pannello frontale fa una bella figura ed anche il vetro sul lato, però ha un problema non da sottovalutare: le dimensioni.Mi sono trovato in grossa difficoltà sia con gli spazi che con il cablaggio all'interno del case, ho montato un iCUE h100i RGB della Corsair ma non nella postazione prevista in quanto nel top case toccava le ram, ho quindi dovuto scambiarlo con le ventole frontali, facendo arrivare però un po' di aria in meno alla PSU (non un grosso problema).Ho anche avuto diversi problemi con il cablaggio in quanto le canaline a disposizione per far scorrere i fili ci sono solo sul pannello frontale,  e lo spazio nel pannello dietro la scheda madre è veramente poco. Do 4 stelle perché mi piace molto esteticamente ed ha un ottimo Airflow con la configurazione di ventole giusta, peccato per gli scarsi spazi nonostante sia un ATX.

Joseph ,4.0,2020 22 July,"
The case its self is Brilliant. Has a nice sleek design and the front mesh panel looks great with the back-lit RGB fans and does a good job of stopping dust getting in. Cable management is easy and there are many different routing holes and clips for your included zipties. The top of the case is open and has a magnetic removable dust filter making for easy cleaning. The front panel is also easily removable.The bottom of the case has yet another removable filter though this time the quality is not as on par as the others.The inside is spacious enough for any current GPU but is of course limited to ATX boards only, no larger.If you plan to use a large CPU cooler then ensure that this case has enough clearance. Right now im running a Noctua NH-D15 inside and it only just manages to squeeze in. Also take note that if you are using loud fans or coolers the sound will be more audible with the mesh than a conventional case.The problem i have had with this case is the three included air intake fans that came in the front, They work for cooling fine but have this irritating noise that almost sounds like a fishing line being reeled in. I ended up replacing them for some more expensive ones anyway so for those sensitive to noise maybe skip on the extra fans and get some high quality ones yourself separate.

Molti mi odieranno per sto fatto, ma per me é piccolo, dentro é montata una scheda madre grande e un radiatore da 320 mm (messo in fronte) impossibile metterlo sopra se avete schede madri grandi.Ma oltre questo.. Laria circola mooolto bene, il pc si presenta molto bello nella scrivania e fa una figura piu che elegante che tamarra, peccato che le ventole non sono programmabili, ma sono ottimissime anche quelle... Da prendere in considerazione il fatto che 3 vontole di questo livello costano 30€ e il case ti sta costando 95€ É REGALATO

La sua figura la fa . Molto bello esteticamente , molto spazioso . Ci si può mettere di tutto . Un po’ rumorose le ventole davanti , sotto stress  si fanno sentire , e per chi vuole silenzio , non è l’essenziale . Beh , non è un problema enorme , alla fine si possono cambiare . Lo spazio dietro per il passaggio dei cavi , non è tantissimo , però è ben strutturato , infatti i molteplici buchi per far passare i fili , permettono un ottimo cable management. In termini di airflow, io lo uso con un dissipatore a liquido della Corsair da 360mm , una ventola da 120 mm posta sul retro , più le 3 ventole poste sul davanti che il case da in dotazione , la cpu sotto stress non supera i 60 e idem la gpu . Molto arieggiato anche con il vetro chiuso . Consigliato

Angel@,5.0,2020 19 June,"
Sono felice dell’acquisto. Il vetro temperato, che è abbastanza trasparente e permette di vedere benissimo i componenti all’interno, ha delle linee che lo attraversano e formano delle figure geometriche tipo rombo.Le ventole frontali sono già cablate, per cui sono presenti sia i cavi di alimentazione che i cavi di controllo per le ARGB.Il case viene fornito con un piccolo controller per poter gestire le luci ARGB delle ventole. Il controller è quello mini della cooler master. Io ho installato nella parte superiore anche il sistema di raffreddamento a liquido della CPU della cooler master. Nel sistema di raffreddamento a liquido era compreso anche il controller standard, al quale ho collegato le ventole del case. Il tutto funziona alla perfezione.Le ventole frontali funzionano perfettamente e spingono molta aria all’interno del case.Avendo montata il radiatore sulla parte superiore (radiatore da 240mm) non ho installato la ventola nella parte posteriore del case (mettendo la mano nella parte posteriore si sente benissimo il flusso d’aria uscente spinto dalle tre ventole frontali).Nel case c’è un filtro antipolvere superiore magnetizzato, che aiuta a mantenerlo pulito, attraverso lo smontaggio.La gestione dei cavi nella parte posteriore è abbastanza agevole, ci sono molti punti dove poter bloccare i cavi con delle fascette (importante avere i cavi abbastanza lunghi).Gli slot dove alloggiare gli hard disk (ce ne sono due per hard disk da 3,5 pollici) sono estraibili, per cui estremante comodo risulta il montaggio.In sintesi sono felice dell’acquisto.Spero che la mia recensione possa esserti utile.

Ho comprato questo case un anno fa, quando il prezzo oscillava sempre sopra i 100 euro e la disponibilità era limitata, tant'è che per averlo venduto e spedito amazon a 95 Euro avevo aspettato più di un mese dal momento dell'ordine.Una attesa che fu ben giustificata vista la bontà del prodotto.Personalmente non ho ancora visto un mid tower con gli spazi interni che ha questo. Fantastico. Ci sta dentro di tutto, e senza aver componenti e cavi compressi.Lo spazio dietro la mobo permette un cable management ottimale, anche per chi utilizza diversi HD/ssd o chi ha alimentatori non modulari.Ventole silenziosissime, areazione al top, filtri che lavorano bene e fanno entrare poca polvere.Effetto visivo per me è da 10 e lode.

This is the first case I brought and the case itself is awesome but the cable management is not they give you cable ties which is helpful but still leaves a mess and my main problem with this case is you get 3argb fans but the controller only allows one to change colour

"
Jakob Gruber,5.0,2022 6 April,"
The case looks amazing. I can't judge the airflow but it has a mash front panel so how bad can it be. The only downside is no exhaust so you might want to carry over 1 fan from an old case.
"
Nathaniel,3.0,2022 1 March,"
I used my original NZXT Phantom case for more than 10 years. It was very well built and got a lot of accessories with it. But it doesn't support 360mm radiator and the power button wasn't really working well. So i bit the bullet and bought this. First impressions, hardly any spare screws or tools. Quality is ok but not good or something to write about. Cable management behind could be better. The fans are ok and relatively silent. The case airflow is good and you need to buy a exhaust fan for the rear of the case. The radiator fits just right, and doesn't have room for anything else. Be mindful of the Ram clearance though if you install a 360mm radiator.

È arrivato in largo anticipo. A una linea veramente accattivante con le ventole accese sarà sicuramente uno spettacolo. Al tatto sembra robusto, farò una recensione dopo il montaggio magari posterò anche un video. Unico neo tutto opzionale giusto due viti per la scheda madre. A questo prezzo mi aspettavo qualcosa in più. Per ora do quatro stelle più in la vedremo. Il case fa la sua figura ,bello ,funzionale e spazioso unico neo il comando di illuminazione dei LED è all'interno e se vuoi cambiare colore all RGB vi tocca aprirlo .

Bei Cooler Master heißt es zwar man könne eine aio auch oben verbauen, jedoch muss diese extrem schmal sein, selbst wenn man kein atx mainboard nimmt. Ansonsten super Qualität für das Geld und genügend Vorbereitungen für ein sauberes Kabelmanagement.

I did a lot of research and looked for many cases in this price range but settled for TD mesh 500 due to its cooling capabilities.Pros: lightweight, decent build quality, good paint quality, front 3 x 120 mm fans, ample of space inside to fit even largest graphics card. good argb effects can be controlled through argb software depending on the motherboard. Temperes glass is of really good quality and held by thumb screws. good cable management but not that great. 4x SSD mounting ports, rubber gromets inculded with case. 2 X HDD drive cages.Cons:  No exhaust fan included which should have been included in this price range. right side panel behind the motherboard flexes easily and not of good quality. The gap between the panel is less. for best cooling you need to put 3 more fans inside which makes the case too pricey as per me. front audio port doesn't have HD audio and it sucks. The front USB ports feel cheaply integrated as they get pushed inside when you put pendrive. restart button is so tiny, I don't understand why they couldn't provide a normal size button?HDD trays are of plastic and one tray was bent when I got it. feels cheap.Finally I want to say that it's a decent cabinet and has good features. Front 3 x fans pull good amount of air inside the cabinet but you definitely need an exhaust fan. Just for the mesh front and front fans they have cheaped out on other aspects of the case which Cooler Master could've easily provided as some other cases provide rear fans and better build quality.

Marco,5.0,2022 24 February,"
Che dire è veramente un ottimo prodotto, mi fa letteralmente impazzire. Super compatto e spazioso, entra tranquillamente una eatx con due dissipatore da 360 (top e front) e una 3080 ti. Il design è oggettivamente bello soprattutto con l'incisione del vetro che richiama la parte frontale. Super consigliato !
"
Nived Kannada,5.0,2021 22 March,"
First of all, I ordered a black cabinet and received a White one. I was okay with it because I liked the look of the white case and that was what I initially thought of buying. But anyway this case looks very premium and the crystal style desing on the side tempered glass is excellent and it gives it that unique limited edition look. The case has excellent build quality and I love it.Only complaint would be the power supply mesh filter on the bottom. It could have been a slide in mechanism. If they made it like that and increased the price a tiny bit, I would still be okay with it.That's my only complaint about this case. Everything else is great.The fans that came with it are extremely silent and good looking. They might not be the best out there. But they do the job decent enough and it looks good.

Andy,3.0,2022 4 April,"
Das Gehäuse hat einen super Airflow, selbst unter Vollauslastung sind alle Komponenten-Temperaturen im grünen Bereich.Das Kabelmanagement ist nicht wirklich durchdacht, der Platz zwischen den rechten Wänden ist viel zu schmal, man muss schon ordentlich fummeln und teils Kabel biegen um sie in dem Hohlraum sinnvoll zu verlegen.Die rechte Aussenwand bekommt man nur mit Kraftaufwand geschlossen. Nicht gut für die Kabel...1 o. 2 cm breiter und das Gehäuse hätte 6 Sterne von mir bekommen.So leider nur 3 Sterne

Federico Ceretti,4.0,2020 18 July,"
Case con ottimo airflow grazie al mesh anteriore e alle 3 ventole da 120mm incluse con il case,molto apprezzata la possibilità di poter aggiungere 4 ulteriori ventole da 120mm oppure una da 120mm sul retro e 2 da 140mm superiori.Il cable management risulta molto semplice e lo spazio interno è assurdo, troveranno posto facilmente schede grafiche anche oltre i 30cm (la mia rtx 2060 super a due ventole ci sta larga) .Un case molto spazioso, bello da vedere, compreso il controller dei led e sotto i 100€ forse l'unica pecca sono le ventole che avrei apprezzato con qualche rpm in più sacrificando la rumorosità (le ventole arrivano ad un massimo di 1350rpm).

Ein tolles Gehäuse sowohl optisch als auch funktionell. Die staubfänger sind gut abnehmbar und abwischbar. Im Innenraum ist genügend Platz vorhanden.

Alfredo Baiano,5.0,2021 6 December,"
Esteticamente bellissimo! 3 ventole ARGB che si collegano tutte con un solo cavo per ""illuminarle"" ed un solo cavo PWM per ""alimentarle"". Purtroppo come qualcuno aveva già notato, le ventole fanno uno strano rumore di fondo che sembra provenire da lontano ed è molto fastidioso, un vero peccato. 😓
"
Marco,5.0,2021 10 April,"
Il design è gradevole, gli interni sono pensati bene per nascondere il più possibile il cablaggio in modo ordinato, l'installazione è piuttosto semplice non appena si capisce come prenderlo.L'unica cosa di cui purtroppo mi sono accorto troppo tardi è che non è provvisto di vani per lettori/masterizzatori dvd, perchè purtroppo ho pensato che si aprisse il fronte e li avesse a scomparsa... Sarà anche un po' errore mio ma... nel 2021 i dvd esistono ancora... non sono dei floppy disc o videocassette... Comunque nel complesso un bel case.
"
Dan Lloyd,4.0,2020 11 July,"
Great case for anyone that needs that extra  airflow!Would have been nicer if it came with 4 fans so one could be configured as an exhaust fan but this is only a minor grumble!Looks great with the mesh front and RGB fans.Wasn't quite enough space in the top of the case to mount the NZXT Kraken Z63 so I had to mount it up front.Unless you have a modular PSU, the space behind the motherboard can be a little tight but is still manageable.All this being said, I still really like the case!

Tiene mucha ventilación, viene con tres ventiladores ARGB. Yo le he instalado 4 ventiladores ARGB (3 en la parte superior y 1 en la parte trasera). El cristal templado tiene un diseño espectacular y puedes ver todos tus componentes de manera limpia.Como punto negativo, la gestión de cables en la parte trasera pudiera haber sido mejor. Otro punto es que los ventiladores aún en lo mínimo, tienen un pequeño sonido como si fuera ruido eléctrico, cosa que no me pasa con los ventiladores que compré.El filtro antipolvo superior es imantado, lo cual ayuda a su mantenimiento.En general estoy contento con la compra. Es mi segunda caja de Cooler Master y seguro repetiré.

Case stupendo e funzionale, però avrei preferito materiali migliori visto che si riga facilmente e ciò mi preoccupa nella sua durata (visto il costo non esiguo, mi aspettavo di meglio)Per il resto spazioso, 3 ventole ARGB incluse, meshato e con filtri sopra e sottoAh dimenticavo, la gestione dei cavi è così così, un poco più di spazio avrebbe fatto bene

Fabio Aiello,5.0,2020 23 July,"
Un ottimo case sia per estetica che per maneggevolezza nell'assemblaggio, un peccato solo per il controller rgb che ho dovuto riadattarlo posizionandolo nella griglia posteriore del case con delle fascette perchè la sincronizzazione è usufruibile solo con schede madri Gigabyte, e la mia non essendolo ho dovuto usare il controller fisico che adatta il sistema. Le 3 ventole rgb anteriori sono ottime e tirano dentro molta aria, ho dovuto aggiungere una ventola posteriore da 120mm per un airflow migliore ma si trovano anche a pochissimi euro. Una cosa molto comoda sono i filtri metallici magnetici in modo da non perderli mai.In riassunto: Ottimo acquisto, consigliatissimo
"
PortaleTech,5.0,2021 13 October,"
Già dall'imballaggio si percepisce una solidità molto alta.Il case si presenta benissimo con 3 ventole aRGB posteriori a mio avviso stupende.Ce la si può giostrare tranquillamente per il cable management sia lato interno che lato esterno del case.Cooler Master una garanzia come sempre.

Case estremamente estetico, spazio adeguato al cable management, bello sotto ogni aspetto, soprattutto la griglia frontale e la vetrata fumé.Ho montato molto agevolmente un dissipatore a liquido da 360mm.Non do 5 stelle perché le ventole sono rumorose. Per 95€ mi aspettavo di meglio, aggiornerò la recensione dopo aver smanettato i settaggi delle velocità.

Das Gewinde in den vormontierten Mainboard-Distannz-Schrauben war unterschiedlich groß.Mein Mainboard lies sich nur mit zwei Schrauben anschrauben, die anderen Schrauben versanken in den Bohrungen ohne Widerstand und Halt. Mit den mitgelieferten Schrauben und den Schrauben mit denen mein Mainboard im Alten Gehäuse abefestigt war.Habe diese dann mit dem mitgelieferten Werkzeug rauseschraubt und die aus meinem alten Gehäuse dort eingeschraubt.Ansonsten bin ich sehr zufrieden mit Verarbeitung, Optik und Montagemöglichkeiten. Kühlung ist gut, auch mit sehr niedrig drehenden Lüftern. Es rappelt nichts, es klappert nichts.

The fans are sexy, manually controllable (via a remote) and it makes for a brilliant setup, but assembling it together with a high end rig can be a bit challenging because of it's PSU-back of mobo cable management setup. Feeding the cables through is a pain in the ass and can take hours.

Ich bin mehr als zufrieden mit dem Gehäuse, aber war auch nicht anders zu erwarten. Jedoch ist es wie bei allem nicht perfekt, erst ein weiterer Lüfter hinten macht den Airflow perfekt und sollte auf jeden Fall nachgerüstet werden, schade dass dieser nicht von Haus aus dabei ist.

Nella recensione non parlerò del fatto che il prodotto è arrivato con leggere ammaccature e sbeccato al bordo,ma parlerò invece della difficoltà per installare gli SSD tramite il sistema a gommini,dal momento che è stato necessario martellare a pugni per far in modo che l'SSD aderisse alla struttura,del fatto che non è realmente compatibile con aurosync dal momento che è da 3 pin l'attacco e non da 4 e può essere scomodamente acceso attaccando il filo al controller e spento staccandolo,che fissare la scheda video risulta davvero scomodo per la posizione dell'attacco e il pannello di vetronon si chiude perfettamente dritto ma resta storto e infine che la scheda madre non viene avvitata perfettamente a causa di problemi geometrici,diffidate dalle magnifiche recensioni che si trovano..... dalle magnifiche pubblicità,l'unica fortuna è stata che Amazon mi ha fatto il rimborso parziale grazie alle ammaccature riscontrate

Gefallen das Design und verarbeitung ist recht gut. Jetzt kommts, aaaaber die abstandhalter für motherboard scheinen andere maße zu haben, man kann keine schrauben reindrehen, sie rutschen durch, greifen nich egal was man für grösen nimmt, man könnte denken zu große gewinde geschnitten. Somit kann man nicht weutermachen und muss sich neue kaufen. Die farbbeschichtung is so dünn, das man husten kann und man hat kratzer drauf. Also sehr vorsichtig, extrem vorsichtig. Die kabelöffnungen die nich gummiert sind, sind so schmal das das breite gehäusekabel kaum ranging, war sehr knifflig. Auf dem bild sah ich einen rgb hub, war leider nich dabei. Sonst passt es schon.

Nel complesso il case si presenta bene, i materiali sono buoni e il pannello laterale in vetro fa una buona figura. L'airflow del case è ottimo. Ho dato 2 stelle a causa delle ventole, ventole esteticamente anche belle ma che emettono un rumore assordante!! Le ho dovute buttare e sostituire con altre. Per me questa cosa non è assolutamente accettabile, considerando anche i quasi 90€ spesi. Per il resto abbastanza soddisfatto

If you get a 280mm liquid cooler and plan to fit in front or top, it does not fit as it describes.If you install on top, it covers a portion of the RAM area therefore cant install RAMIf install on front, there is a hump in the casing which won't allow enough space to properly fit it in front.Otherwise anything 240mm and smaller fits perfect

Just a great case overall. You need silent air cooling? It's got you covered. The only issue I had was that the included RGB controller was a little bit confusing to get hooked up correctly.

After I spent a while in the BIOS messing with fan curves, this thing is basically silent and the airflow is awesome. Keeps my 3080 and 5950x cool without noise until I'd really putting them to use.The two things that I wish were different are:-5-10mm more space in the back for cable management. It's a tight squeeze getting that right side panel on.-A USB-C port on the front panel.

Los contras son difícilmente una razón para no halagar este producto, y si ya cuentas con ventiladores propios de una mejor calidad entonces saldrás ganando con este gabinete.

as the title says...the interior becomes dusty over a short time ( close to the ground ""8cm off the ground"" )you can easily clean the front air intake by simply blowing air from your mouth on a downward angle and pick up the dust with your finger tips at the bottom...it's fun but the mesh let a lot of dust through ( dusty interior after 2 months )it has a good airflow but it's messy when used close to the ground

Collin,4.0,2021 18 June,"
Case is either too shallow or too short to fit a 280mm rad on in the top of the case. This may work better with motherboards with smaller heat sinks. I am using a x570 aorus master and in the top mount the rad hits the motherboard heat sinks. I was able to force it in but I could only get the front couple screws in, it is contacting the motherboard and at a bit of an angle. In hindsight, I should of got a 360mm rad. Other then that, this case is really nice. It's light and sturdy. The glass and and front mesh look great.

Me gusto demasiado el espacio y la atención al detalle para facilitar el armado, cinchos, bandas ya establecidas, pequeños canales por donde pasar los cables, postes previamente instalados, buenos materiales de pintura, bandejas de hdd muy fáciles de remover sin el uso de herramientas y buen espacio para refrigeración líquida y por aire, lo malo es que es complicado colocar los ssd si no es en las bandejas del hdd y que hay un espacio abierto por donde se pueden ver los cables traseros y es complicado esconderlos en esa zona.

5950x + Strix 3090 setup:Not gonna lie, I wanted a Fractal Torrent however this case really picked my interest. And Gamers Nexus review sealed the deal for me.Ordered it and 2 days later I started assembling.LOVE the front panel, LOVE the top panel and overall I love the case itself and it’s airflow. For 90$ you are getting a lot!Downsides (maybe my fault?):Second picture: had to use a really messy zip tie to hold my SSD. Why? My 1300w power supply is too large and I had to remove the storage side panel section to make room for the cables.So this one is maybe my fault

Budget friendly airflow case!Building in this case was a treat. Love the mesh on the front. Looks so much better in person though. The pictures really don't do it justice. The fans that are included work well, the RGB is exactly what you expect. The glass side panel is beautiful with the engraved lines.If I was to knock on one thing it would be the powersupply dust cover but if you have watched any reviews that should not be a shock. You also have to remember it does its job and its on the bottom so you don't see it. So its really hard to knock on that.Cable management was easy, I love that you can remove the hd bay for more room for cables. Because I use all SSD its just nice to have a little more room.I paired with the CoolerMaster MasterLiquid ML240L RGB V2 and ATX motherboard from MSI.Everything mounted great, looks great and is very functional.It looks greatIt has great airflowFor the price I can't give it anything by 5 stars.

Great value for the price. Good looking and well built. Fans work well and are fairly quiet.Pros:Feels well built and sturdy. All parts fit nicely into place. Cable management compartment is spacious and has nice rubber grommets and plenty of hidden holes for routing any cablesCase looks sleek and glass panel is a nice touch. RGB has a ton of settings and can be turned off entirely if wanted.Minor Cons:The RGB controller for the case isn't the best setup, the controller comes an input for an external switch but no wiring for it. I used the reset button and connected to that so the reset on the case controls the RGB instead of rebooting. Not a big deal for me because I don't use reset ever, but they could have included controls on the front panel.The metal mesh screen on the bottom can pop off easily when moving the case around. Not a big deal to put back on but can be a bit annoying when setting it up.

So ya, it's metal box that holds your PC components. The airflow is great, the stock fans could be better, but this is a cheap case so I didn't expect them to be premium.My main issue with this case is the lack of cable management room at the back. Please give us more space at the back, it's more difficult than normal to get the cables to fit.

Hagar,5.0,2021 20 December,"
I hadn't built a computer for a few years but was pleasantly surprised at how good these cases are for cable management and mounting SSDs, etc. I still miss having a Bluray drive installed so I'll have to find an external closure (which are suddenly ridiculously difficult to find and super expensive for some reason). I installed a new i5-12600K and motherboard in it with no issues and I added another Coolermaster Halo Duo fan to the CPU cooler and an exhaust fan in the back of the case, as well as a 120 mm to the top of the case (hard to see in the pic). I think two 140 mm fans at the top would probably be the best solution so I'll add those later.I think it needs at least the fan at the back to help balance the 3 fans pulling air in from the front. I am running the i5 and an older MSI 1660 Super (because I can't buy a video card!) and the CPU and other motherboard sensors average around 29-30 degrees, even with a mild overclock applied. It could probably use an RGB strip at the bottom since it's quite dark there. No issues running Gigabyte's RGB Fusion app to control all the fans - I daisy chained them all together so they are controlled as one (no need for the fan controller it comes with if you have an ARGB header on the motherboard).The only small item I don't like is that the power button is outlined in a solid white light and it would be nice if that was blue or even RGB addressable! I also noticed that the Coolermaster fans that the case comes with don't seem to color match with any other RGB lights I've added (different model of Coolermaster fans and light strips). Especially blue - the included fans are more purplish-blue but all other lights are the correct blue color. I may end up replacing those front fans but they're fine for now.Good case, good value!

"
Brando,4.0,2022 16 May,"
This is not one of those high efficiency cases designed to minimize space footprint and fan count. This is a case that works best with three intake fans at the front and that's what it comes with. There is enough room on top to mount a 280 mm radiator + fan and it clears (barely) my ram and VRM heat sinks. There is no vertical gpu mounting but there is side storage mounting. You can choose to mount the AIO fans outside the case and the radiator inside but the cut outs obstruct airflow for anything above 120 mm and the mounting is at the bottom front rather than top front of the case. Make sure to get an aRGB motherboard to go with it as the stock fans are spectacular. All in all, a pretty solid case. The hard plastic mesh in the front is good you can just wash and dry it.***Edit: I am very saddened to say that its only been half a week and one of the rgb fans led already out and its not the motherboard. Also the clip on psu filter falls off all the time and is easy to lose but small thing if you just tape it.. I will see if coolermastervis willing to warranty just one fan without me having to exchange the whole case.
"
Jeremy,5.0,2021 22 August,"
This is a very solid case. It’s easy to assemble and the argb fans look great. I didn’t have any issue with the screws unlike some of the comments and as long as you are careful with installation it shouldn’t be a problem.Only potential issue is that the fans are CM sickleflow 120, which have some bad reputation. They can get loud and may crap out more easily. The fans on default rpm have a low humming noise but decreasing their speed by about 5% solved the problem.

"
Richard Moniz,5.0,2021 4 October,"
This case has a high-end look and feel.There are some small sacrifices to keep costs low such as the use of screws to hold cards, and to take off the case panels, but for how often you use these features I find it easy to sacrifice on something like a screw. The glass panel is thick and sturdy. I did originally plan to use a 240mm AIO which didn't fit because I used a MicroATX motherboard which placed the RAM sticks up to tight to the top of the case. Didn't matter too much as I was still able to use 8 fans in total.

My motherboard (Asus Z270) only had a 4 pin RGB header which did not connect with the wires for the fans which I meant I had to use a sata cable to connect it, however my power bank didn't have enough sata which was really annoying and I was forced to get and use another powerbank. Other than that, the case was really nice to work with.

RGB was a pain to get working, but that could have been partly the motherboard's fault.The build quality is high and has good airflow.

Great case, no issues. Very happy with it and at a good price.  We ended up purchasing two of them, one white and one black for each of our two daughters who are gamers. We purchased 4 additional fans, 3 for on top and one needed in the back. (approx. $56 additional investment).

En lo que respecta a dimensiones para manejo de cables, capacidad de ventiladores, diseño y flujo de aire es en definitiva uno de los mejores gabinetes que hay en el mercado, lo único negativo es que los ventiladores argb de Cooler Máster realmente no son muy atractivos así que los cambie por un LL120 de Corsair pero la combinación de estos 2 productos definitivamente hace relucir los pros de este gabinete.

Muy buen producto. Trae soporte para radiador de hasta 360mm frontal y superior de 280mm o 320. Lamentablemente si pones un radiador en la parte superior te restringe para colocar un ventilador trasero.Tiene ranuras para 2 HDD y 2 SSD en la parte baja y para colocar otros 2 SSD.El unico detalle es el precio, si lo adquiers por menos de 1700 como en mi caso no lo dudes.A otro detalle es que debes montar primero la fuente porque te deja muy poco espacio para maniobrar si lo pones despues. O si quieres cambiarla después, te dara problemas al sacarla sin mover los HDD.

Josh,3.0,2021 19 November,"
bought because read good reviews about this case, but in the first few minutes of using it, I noticed a weird clunking noise from one of the front fans, then it went away, but it was still making an unpleasant unstable high frequency noise, which is then amplified by the case, most likely a QA issue with the case fan, but I personally won't bother trying a second one out.And yes, I did make sure it was the case fans, unplugged all 3 and the noise went away, meanwhile the other RGB fans I bought are running without any strange noise.

 Es un muy buen gabinete, la única desventaja que le veo, es que los ventiladores no son 100% silenciosos, pero tampoco es que suenen como una turbina, si eres muy quisquilloso con el sonido de los ventiladores, mejor ve por otra opción. sin embargo no es ni molesto el ruido que hace. Otra cosa es que no cuenta con un filtro apara el polvo en la parte frontal, lo cual puede que entre un poco mas de polvo, sin embargo a mi en lo personal que no vivo en un área en donde entre mucho polvo, para mi no es problema. El gabinete es un deleite visual!!!

Oasis Seeker,2.0,2021 5 October,"
Nice aesthetic and plenty of space will fit the chunkiest GPUs. Easy cable management thanks to cutouts for your cable ties. PSU air intake filter is somewhat cheap, simply a rectangular piece of mesh. 360mm radiator on top can be a tight fit especially if you have a fan in the back as the cables for the case IO also occupy the same spaceUpdate: One of the fans that came with the case started to produce a rattling noise, faint but audible

Este gabinete es realmente grande y sus 3 ventiladores ARGB son de la misma marca y vienen con múltiples colores y algunos estilos pre seleccionados.El único detalle es que los cables de los ventiladores hacia tu tarjeta madre y demás son delgados y lucen algo frágiles además de cortos, el controlador del ARGB es igual de corto y tendrás que arreglartelas de alguna manera para colocarlo dentro del gabinete y aún así quedará colgando por ahí.Algo que deberás tener en cuenta es que los cables del ARGB se pueden desconectar incluso cuando ya pusiste la tapa trasera, puedes ponerle algo de cinta para que se queden en su lugar o quizás un cincho.

Bonito diseño, el vidrio templado lateral tiene unas líneas que convergen con las del panel frontal, los tres ventiladores que incluye son ARGB por lo que los efectos de iluminación son aún más personalizables y únicos, me gustó el espacio interior y la forma en que puedes colocar los SSD, no me gustó el espacio para manejo de cable, ni lo cercano de las bahías de los HDD de 3.5 de la fuente de poder, tampoco incluye ventilador trasero, que a mi parecer es muy importante, yo te recomiendo estas dos opciones: https://amzn.to/3p4S2bx (el que yo le coloqué) o este otro https://amzn.to/3p5vaZuOtra cosa que no me termino de gustar fue la poca calidad de los filtros de la fuente y de la parte posterior, lo mejor sin duda el diseño, ventiladores frontales, monturas ssd y el vidrio templado.

El gabinete en general esta muy bien hecho no presenta problemas, es excelente pero la forma en la que la sección donde van los discos duros esta construida y ensamblada es muy mala debido a que la vibración normal de los discos duros se transfiere al resto del gabinete de tal forma que suena muy fuerte la vibración , se escucha como si tus discos furos estuvieran dañados pero no están dañados están bien es la vibración de gabinete la que se transfiere de esa manera, debo moverlo cada rato hasta que deja de sonar y luego vuelve a sonar y así todo el tiempo. estoy probando formas para que el contacto entre los soportes y el gabinete no hagan esos ruidos por que muchas veces te dan un buen susto. es el único detalle del gabinete en mi experiencia, por lo demás esta excelente

Was looking to replace an old stock PC case to fit a new PSU and bought this for the room/space it provides. Was easy to setup albeit a time-consuming and tedious process. Does not require and tools apart from a flathead screwdriver and is designed to fit any motherboard. I was not able to get the front USB ports to work but I am pretty certain that's related to my old motherboard vs the case itself. Lights were a bonus. And with some testing my PC is now running 20 degrees celsius less on idle, which is surprising.

Using this enclosure for a gaming PC. My son swapped out the internal guts from his old case and put it in this case. Took him all day to do it (he's never done it before) and asked for my help a few times. The instructions seemed to be easy to follow.This is a great afternoon project. If you don't know what you're doing, or not comfortable with this kind of job, get a friend to do it for you. Overall, a nice case, great air flow to cool the chips and nice flashing lights.

So you get what you pay for.To start, it looks all right but the sound quality is poor. I got another small child's keyboard half the size that honestly sounds better for $15. Also, this thing gets LOUD. We had to put tape over the on/off button because whenever it's turned on/off by young kids, the volume (for some reason unbeknown to GOD) resets at *10* instead of 1, so it is incredibly loud EVERY. SINGLE. TIME, and needs turned down all the way down back to 1. Not even sure why it goes up so high, because honestly 1 is a perfectly acceptable volume on this thing for indoor use. This thing easily doesn't need to go above 4/5 but it goes to 10! So, that's fun. And don't think about karaoke, the microphone is incredibly cheap and when the kids play with it talking/singing loudly while pressing the microphone directly on their lips (as kids do) it is DEAFENING, even when the piano volume is set down as low as it can go.Besides that, neither keyboard really worked properly. The first I ordered about a month before Christmas with all the other gifts because I was worried about supply chain issues. So we didn't open it and use it until it was almost too late to return. Within just a couple days of opening and only a few normal uses, the left speaker started fuzzing loudly to the point normal play was intolerable. It would stop if you lightly struck it, but just for a minute but then slowly come back just as loud as before. It wouldn't stop unless you bonked it again. So it was unusable. Thankfully we were still within the return window but by then all the boxes had been trashed.Should have known better!After I had already returned it, I read the return paper (yes, that was my mistake, but even if I had read it beforehand there was nothing I could have done about it). It said it HAD to be returned in it's original box AND packaging. If it was returned in anything larger we'd face up to a 50% (yep, 50!) ""repackaging"" fee. And of COURSE, the place we had to return it, UPS, only had one box big enough to fit it (everything else was too small for the dimensions) and that huge box alone cost us $30. So if they do charge us that 50% fee, plus the cost of the box we had to buy to return it, we may as well have just paid for a second one! Can't wait to hear from them about that, because I will not be happy or kind if they try to charge that fee. Who in the world would keep such a large box around? I think we kept it for a couple days (trashed it *before* the speaker started fuzzing) but we unfortunately live in a small trailer and don't have room to store that kind of stuff more than a few days.Anyway, I had hoped the replacement would be ok, but I probably should have known better.Within minutes of plugging it in, it shut off then instantly turned back again (and up to full volume! YAY!). This happened several times over the course of just a few minutes of play so I was CONSTANTLY having to turn down the atrociously loud volume. I assumed I didn't fully connect the adapter plug all the way in to the keyboard or wall. But I checked and nope, the plug was fully plugged in to both. So it has some sort of loose or jiggly wire/part inside or a connective issue internally with the adapter/jack. I was about to return it too but avoided the chore for a few days. Luckily over the past week it seems to not be happening anymore. So we are keeping it (for now). Still I'm freaked out something electrical is wrong with and am nervous about leaving it plugged in. And I really don't want to face the hassle of returning at this point, even though I saved the box and Styrofoam packaging this time) in case it gets worse or some other issue pops up. Which really would not surprise me.Anyway, it's been a very unpleasant experience all around and I absolutely wouldn't recommend this keyboard to anyone at all, ever. If I had to do it again I would definitely spend an extra few hundred dollars on a good, quality keyboard and probably go to a music store so we could try it out first to make sure it didn't have any annoying features and actually had some semblance of quality. My advice is just steer clear of this, it was a pretty big waste and a hassle to boot.

The quality just fit it’s price. As a beginner, If it is for kid, it has everything that necessary to play. If you are a adult, it is enough for learning until your skill improves and get a better one since it is cheap.I am new with piano too，I feel the sound quality is pretty nice. Maybe the expert will says it has bad and trash sound, but since I have no way to extinguish its sound compare with the sound from professional piano, I could only judge its sound based on my feeling, it’s good.Here are some little details about it, including good and bad:1. The volume control is good, the smallest volume can almost control on one room, while the loudest sound you can heard from one floor away.2. It is come with a speaker, but there is no place to put the speaker. By the same reason, there is place to hold a headphone if you have one.3. The weight of it is very light, I guess it will break so easy if falling to the floor. So be careful.4. There’s no user guide about how to assembly the components into a piano stand. This is take time to figure out the right way. If you feel something wrong about your stand, that probably because some mistakes you make when you put them together.5. The piano comes with a clean keyboard with no letter on it, but they provide letter stickers. You have to put them on by yourself. Maybe some people don’t need letters on keyboard, but Since I am a beginner, and it’s type piano is mostly for beginner, so I need the letters on keyboard anyway, I would like the factory has the letters on the keyboard already.6. I haven’t try how it connects to other digital device, maybe you can find out on someone else’s views.

Santa brought this for my music-loving 6yr old daughter for Christmas. 🎅🎁🎄It is exactly what she wanted!!!I poured through different keyboards and reviews for hours before settling on this one. I'm so glad I went with this one. It is fabulous for a child or beginner. Everything works as it should. The sound is good. It has lots of great functions and features and is a good size.Sure, a musician who expects top notch sound and fuction might want a higher quality keyboard, and should probably fork out the several hundred / thousands for top-of-the-line instruments. 🤷🏼‍♀️ If you're looking for professional grade, this isn't it. I mean.... it is kind of odd to see people rating a $150 keyboard as ""junk"" 🤔 as if they expected something amazing at this price point.  Like, you wouldn't buy a $500 1999 Ford Focus and expect it to perform like a 2020 Mercedes Benz would you? No... you can't even compare the two. You get what you pay for.It is plastic, light-weight, definitely not a top-notch professional piece of equipment. But it works wonderfully in every way it should and is perfect for my little girl.  I play on it with her as well and I enjoy it too. 😊 it is large enough that we can play ""Heart and Soul"" side by side.  💞We are definitely happy with our purchase and I highly recommend this keyboard for other children or adults who want a low price keyboard that does the job without breaking the bank.Thanks Santa!!!! 😍

Jenna,4.0,2020 5 June,"
I'm in my twenties and decided I wanted to learn piano so I got this to see if it would be something I'm interested in. It's been good for me to learn on. The key size is a little smaller than a standard piano. It is off-tune and the sound quality isn't superb, so if you have a musical ear that may drive you nuts. It's off enough that apps that require you to hit a note to continue won't pick it up as the right key. Also the sound automatically is max volume every time you turn it on.  The stand was completely skewed for me, so I didn't end up using the stand at all. Also the stand for the music snapped off when I tried to put it in. It is really light which has been nice.This has been a good tool for me to see if I want to invest in a better keyboard in the future if I actually use it, but isn't something I would want to use for an extended time.If you are looking for something to tinker around with, this is a good option. If you are serious about learning piano and want a long investment, I would look for something a little more pricey.

Deaton,4.0,2020 8 April,"
I've just begun learning to play piano, and this keyboard is exactly what I was looking for to help me out! For the reasonable price, you get the keyboard, the stand, a (low quality but usable) microphone, and stickers to label all 61 of the keys. The stickers are without a doubt one of the biggest bonuses in my eyes, as it helps beginners learn where on the keyboard all notes are at. Plus, there's volume control, various timbres and rhythms, and even drum noise options included. While the sound quality isn't necessarily perfect compared to higher priced keyboards, it is still very clear and accurate. If you're looking for something reasonably priced to get you started in learning to play, this is the keyboard for you!

A. Mangini,5.0,2016 17 October,"
This item offered me pretty much all I wanted in a low priced electronic instrument that would sit on either side of my piano and offer me a large selection of tones and rhythms. As a bonus I can record whatever I want. Sometimes I add rhythm to my playing, other times a particular tone that mimics the emotion of the piece I am playing, still other times I can go to straight electronic playing because there are five octaves of keys with lots of room for both hands, furthermore I can go right hand electronic chords and play left hand on my grand. I play for myself so I don't need pro stuff. I like to improvise and experiment for my own pleasure and it doesn't cost me an arm and a leg. Speaking of legs; there's no foot pedals. You need to pre-set everything for every song, which does not bother me. The volume is plenty powerful: So far with right hand on piano cords and left hand on the electric keyboard I only need volume set at level 3. This baby will keep you busy for quite a while. Have fun playing your favorite tunes.

This was for my daughter at Christmas. After a house fire a few years ago, we discovered the piano was not salvageable.  My daughter loved playing the piano and missed having one.  She lives in smaller quarters now, so I got her this keyboard for Christmas.  She is absolutely delighted and has been playing it just about every day.  I wish I could have gotten her a full piano, but since I could not, this was a wonderful second-best.

This is my third time purchasing this particular keyboard. I have now over the past four years bought one for each of my daughters. I had bought one at first four years ago, and then two years later my second daughter wanted a keyboard. So I asked my first daughter how hers was doing and she said still works great! So bought the next one. Then this last year my third daughter wanted a keyboard. So I asked both other daughters how it was holding up and they both said they worked great still. So I have now purchased the tired one for third daughter. So it has sustainability and quality for the price! Thank you for such a great product!

olyjan,4.0,2017 19 July,"
Bought this for 14 year old grandson who is percussionist in school band.  He plays it every day - as practice for 'bells', and mallet instruments, since keyboard is same.  It is a good substitute for these expensive instruments that most people don't have in their homes.  For us, the 'downside' is only that there are too many 'bells and whistles'.  He pushed all the buttons maybe once and then picked  2-3  'sounds' that were relevant to his need.  This keyboard is sturdy, grandson thinks the 'keys' feel much like our piano.  So, for the price it was a good choice.  If you have an advanced student or need quality sound, you will need to spend lot's more money - but it's music, eh?  it's worth it!

It's often said you get what you pay for. I was not expecting a top of the line product. In fact I was aware that I was just selecting this option because I thought it was a bargain. But some features were not only limited but also a little bit upsetting. For example the volume, it defaults to maximum. You adjust it to a more tolerable level (I live in an apartment and have to take into account the presence of other inhabitants in the building) and leave it unused for 10 min and it's back again to maximum.In general I think this is a good starting keyboard for kids that want to play around for a while, but I don't recommend it if you are planning to be a little bit more serious with music.

We bought this for our grandson, he is only 3 yrs old. So it will take a lot of abuse. It sounds OK for beginners. We think he will have fun pounding and making music with this. He loves to play music and has a knack for making melodies.
"
Mackenzie Larson,4.0,2019 24 June,"
Amazing! This key board is the first I’ve ever played on, the microphone and music stand is made cheaply and out of easily breakable plastic, other than that it comes with stickers to place on the keys to learn the notes also comes with a bunch of songs built in and a recording option, for the most part I love it! (Giving 4 stars because I don’t use the microphone anyways)
"
ThaGeminiGoddess♊️,5.0,2020 23 December,"
I bought this keyboard about 8 months ago and I love it!! It's great for a beginner instrument, quality made, and lightweight for transport.  It also come with its own case!! once I buy my more advanced instruments, I plan on passing this one to my son
"
Lina RoHo,3.0,2021 16 May,"
Volume is REALLY loud, and when you turn it on it defaults to the loudest volume. Even on the lowest volume it’s loud enough to wake the whole house. The buttons are not entirely intuitive. As a toy, it’s totally fine if you’re OK with the volume issue, but not much more.

IndigenousSpirit,3.0,2020 20 January,"
I had thought this was the best deal and values for the price after 3 months of reviews and searching all the options in my price range but in under 3 weeks after recieving what I was so excited for and did endless hours of research and read reviews the low A quit working. We live in a 2 mature adult household with tons of respect to our instruments so it is not a case of neglect or improper use! Wanted to update my review because it’s important to have an accurate review as many use this

My 12 year-old received this keyboard as a gift and really likes it! The quality of the piano sound is very good, although a few other instruments sound fake. The keys were smaller than expected but still easy to play. The microphone has a clear sound without distorting the voice. It’s great to get the stand with the keyboard - it’s sturdy & stable.
"
Joseph,1.0,2022 19 January,"
So i am a music major who is doing class piano to satisfy my credits. I am a complete beginner to piano but i know how a piano should feel and play, this is not it. Sound quality is terrible, keys are sticky and bad, cords that come with it are flimsy and worst of all, the key issue. The amazon Key issue seems to be a trend with this keyboard and i got this just before seeing this. Well i can side with those who have that issue because it is real. And thats not even the most annoying thing. Terrible sound and sticky keys are the worst thing a pianist can experience.In conclusion, its better to pay that extra 30 dollars for that 120 dollar piano than it is to buy this piano for a beginner. Buy the better one now so that you can last longer
"
David Mennicke,3.0,2021 27 May,"
The keyboard was easy to set up and is very portable.  Sound quality is adequate.  Main problem is that the keys are not standard size--they are smaller than a standard keyboard keys.

pkf,5.0,2018 28 March,"
I bought this for my mom's 94th birthday.  She used to have a large, good quality organ that she played frequently, but it would not fit in the assisted-living apartment where she lives now. From what I can see, this piano is fine for learning to play, for practice, and for the pianist's own enjoyment.  It is lightweight, which is both a blessing and a curse: it is easy to move when necessary, but it is also likely to topple.For the price, it is a good purchase.
"
Wendy Totten,1.0,2019 2 December,"
I bought this for my wife for an early Christmas gift, and this is honestly the first time I've ever asked someone to return the gift I got them.  I had a Casio back in the 90's that cost 60 dollars which sounded better than this thing did.  The stand/mic and included key lables were of terrible quality and honestly the manufacturer should've skipped the extras and went for a better quality instrument.  My issues with this product were:- The keys are toy-like- Terrible sound quality on both the instruments and melodies.- An ever present hiss and static coming from both the speakers and audio out at all times which increases with volume increase.- A extremely loud pop comes from the speakers and audio out when the power button is pushed.- The microphone is just downright terrible- The included key lables peeled after day one even though I used rubbing alcohol/ammonia and a micro fiber cloth to ensure the plastic was properly prepped.I'm returning this and getting the Alesis Melody 61 MK 2.  It's cheaper overall since the shipping is free and the product comes with some nice extras as well as having far better sound quality.Bottom line, you can do better for less with the Alesis.  Even a beginner will be frustrated with this product.
"
Adonas Cary,4.0,2019 3 June,"
This was a gift for my husband who could amuse himself for hours with this. Luckily for me he was impressed his complaints were that the keys are a little too small for him and he has trouble recording what hes playing and playing it back.
"
Suzy ,5.0,2017 5 January,"
My 6yo LOVES this! I purchased it because of the mic, which my daughter loves. She enjoys using all the pre-set rhythms. I also ordered the stick on notes for the keys, which is great for learning. Only complaint is that I couldnt figure out how to strap keyboard to the stand. Seems like that might be an option, but directions weren't clear. I also didnt realize when I purchased that it doesnt come with power cord and didnt want to use all the batteries. Luckily I had a cord that fit lying around that works.

Budiee1,1.0,2021 6 November,"
The on off button when pushing in with your finger to turn on, goes in further than it should.My 87 year old mom turned it on and now has np way of turning it off.  The button fell inside the piano.I have no way of getting it out so she has to unplug it to turn it off.  I tried returning it but was told it was too late.False advertising... it was advertised as a piano/organ.  When mom got home from rehab and we opened it up, found out that it is ONLY a piano.  Mom was in the hospital for 2 weeks and then in rehab for 3 weeks, so we can't return it.Total waste of money.I wrote to the seller weeks ago and have heard nothing back.
"
Riccarda,3.0,2016 2 December,"
I bought this because I recently moved to America for 12 months and I didn't want to give up on playing the piano completely. I bought this in an offer for 75$ and for that price I'm okay with it. It does its job. Obviously nothing compared to a real piano. However, I would never pay the original price for it cause its definitely not worth more than 100$! It feels pretty cheep and I'm not sure if it will last for long. The sound doesn't sound anything like a piano. You can still have fun with it and as of now  (one day after I received it) I don't regret buying it. Delivery was very fast
"
Florey Ramos,5.0,2020 12 February,"
I got this as a Christmas gift and its really cool. I don't know if its just me but when you press the keys on the higher parts, it sounds weird like its being blocked by something. Overall it is a great gift and great for beginners like myself.
"
Jimmathy,2.0,2021 25 December,"
ive had mine for about a month now, but about two weeks in, it got harder to press certain keys. Db in middle c is the most problematic because it has to be pressed almost all the way to work
"
Nancy,3.0,2018 24 January,"
I bought this specific model because of the music holder, but I am very disappointed in it. It is really flimsy and very short, wont hold a normal piece of music or a lesson book. Keys feel ok, and sound is good, just wanted something to play that was small, portable, won't be using all the bells and whistles. It is a nice size for my purposes. Want to practice without driving the neighbors nuts.I paid for an accident protection plan, but don't have any information about what to do if I have any problems with the keyboard. Can you help me with that????
"
YellowArtist91,4.0,2018 6 October,"
I love this piano for early learners. I bought this Keyboard for my daughter and it makes its job, although I don’t completely like the electronic sound of a couple of keys (the rest sound good). As I said for children and early learners is a very good investment.
"
Gian Carlo,3.0,2017 27 June,"
This keyboard is ok. I'm fine with it since i'm a beginner who is just trying to learn the basics and fundamentals of how to play a piano. For the price I paid for, I didn't expect too much. The one thing that bugs me with this piano is at a certain note and the corresponding notes after it, there is a loud almost like a high frequency sound that I hear. It is annoying and bothersome but for now this piano is fine but I will be upgrading to a better piano sooner or later. Also the stand is not even. One side is longer than the other.
"
Erick Dallas,4.0,2019 20 May,"
For anyone trying to play piano for fun can get this. The sounds of the notes are ok, just the speakers sound cheap. I recommend if anyone wants to actually want a good piano needs to find a better quality.
"
Tim Snyder,3.0,2020 22 March,"
Remarkably cheap construction. I bought this to help me learn the violin. I use it to tune the violin, and to play certain phrases to make sure I am playing in tune on the violin. It does the job for that. I can’t speak regarding its other features. It does not have full-size keys.
"
Feonix,1.0,2017 28 July,"
Okay so I had problems with this keyboard immediately after setup.First thing I noticed is that the stand does not sit perfectly on a hard surface so there is rocking back and forth, which will just not do with a keyboard.Secondly, the sound quality was horrible. I used headphones (nice over the ear ones) and the speakers built in with the machine and the quality of the sound was just horrible.Thirdly, and most importantly, the keys on this thing are as cheap as ever. I'd say about 10 of the keys do this strange thing. When I push down on them to play they go straight down then shift to the left a bit. This causes it to come into contact with the key next to it and it gives you a grinding sound and makes it hard to play 2 white keys that are next to each other at the same time.I highly suggest you move on and try another keyboard if you want any sort of quality at all. If you want to get one as cheap as possible this might be okay for you but you get what you pay for I suppose. I thought $80 was semi decent for a keyboard but I was wrong.
"
Rlampy,4.0,2018 7 February,"

Bought 2 of these for my twin daughters for Christmas so I have not seen or heard them at full function yet. I did open one up to check out and I really do think they will be pleased. We have a baby grand piano so they wanted a keyboard to practice up in their rooms before presenting us with a concert and I do believe they will want to play these for the concert verses the baby grand. CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!

"
Jennifer Anyanwu,2.0,2019 5 February,"
The piano looks nice and the volume can get really loud - which is good. My only issues are that it can only work when plugged into a wall, the sounds are pretty generic and off key, and the keys move to the side a lot instead of going straight down when you press it. I don't think it will last much longer, but it's definitely for beginners who need a cheap keyboard to start with. If you're more advanced - then spend more money on a Yamaha or something nice. I also like that you can change the sound of the keys (100+ options). But overall, I wouldn't recommend this mainly because of the super cheap keys that shift to the side when you use it. Get something that sounds less like a toy and more like a grand piano.

Ohitsandrew,3.0,2016 12 October,"
It is a good piece of equipment for what you're paying for, I do have to say that I don't really like the keys on it. The keys are very cheap and thin, they tend to rub against eachother once in awhile when you press on them at angle if you're playing long scale notes or playing fast. This is not a bad buy for a beginner piano player like myself. The microphone is very cheap too along with the stand. Overrall good for a begining piano player.

This is my first keyboard and it's excellent! It's very light so moving it from place to place, is a snap.  It also handles my little ""tornadoes"" as they think they are music prodigies. They are 1, 3, and 5.  The day that I received it, I immediately started messing with it and 30 minutes later, I could play ""house of gold"" by the 21 Pilots!!!!

Mitchell F,2.0,2017 8 November,"
I have to be honest, I was excited to get this piano.The product came in yesterday, I was overly excited.Updated:Now I turned on the keyboard, there are issues already. They keys have a delay, and when recording, it cannot record playing 2 keys at once. it counts a 3 key not as 3 notes. I have done everything possible to get in contact, This isn't anything like yhou'd image it would be for the price.old:Then the stand came in within the same box.The nob for changing its height was broken.I felt kind of robbed because I paid for the full product. Now I will need a new stand or just return this piano.The piano works. It works for what you paid for. nothing more.
"
Kelly,3.0,2017 24 April,"
Item arrived in great condition. The keyboard and all of the features work great, perfect for those wanting to learn. Wish the adapter to plug-in was longer as it doesn't leave much space. Also, the stand is crooked and the keyboard does not fit properly on it, so I am unable to use. Overall for the functionality of the keyboard, it would be a 4-5 star product. As for the adapter and stand, 3 stars.

"
Matthew Smith,2.0,2017 28 September,"
Really, just all around a disappointment. It was much smaller than I had anticipated; the keys were not ""standard size."" It felt very cheap. The stand was really flimsy. It didn't sound good either. It had sort of a weird, childish, ""electric ting"" sound that felt closer to a toddler's toy than a piano. It was easy to return, however. They refund was issued promptly shortly after I dropped it off at UPS. Hopefully I will get the money back in my account in the next couple days and buy the Casio instead. If you are on the fence, I suggest you do the same. Even if you are just trying to learn how to play, the extra $40 is worth it.

Bill J.,5.0,2019 24 March,"
This keyboard is worth the money. The keys are not waited, but the price is great. Enjoy the stand and the mic too. You will not be dissatisfied. Your beginner pianist will be very happy!
"
Angelene,5.0,2020 27 December,"
The kids love it.
"
Rylee,5.0,2020 17 April,"
I love this! The higher part of the keyboard is very off though, but worth the money!
"
Ty Valentine,3.0,2017 8 July,"
It's great for beginners, but still have a more electronic synth sound, no matter the timbre, even on the Acoustic Piano setting, it doesnt sound as organic and classic as I'd like it to, like say a grand piano would. Also the microphone isn't that great, not even for kareoke, and my piano stand is durable slightly unbalanced (creating a minor wobble effect).
"
Cindy,5.0,2019 1 January,"
I bought this for my 7 year old grandson for Christmas and it was the hit of the presents! It has great sound and so many buttons and sounds. The microphone works great too. A++
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2017 28 December,"
Just what I needed! Perfect to learn and play all kinds of music, and I’ve been rusty for awhile. I looked forward to receiving this, and it was shipped on time, and well packaged for protection, but still easy to remove and get playing quickly.

"
BayBee,5.0,2017 7 June,"
Got this for my Grand Princess who wanted to learn how to play.  She loves it.  The stand is perfect and the sound of the keyboard is awesome.  She has a lot of fun with it and can play some good songs now.

This item was delivered quickly.  I opened the box but did not use the item.  It is for a gift for Christmas but I think it will be cherished and loved.  A much better quality Piano than I was expecting especially at such an amazing price!
"
Amber Clark,3.0,2017 10 May,"
The price for this is amazing I was happy to be getting a keyboard piano for the price but I'm absolutely disappointed that the keyboard does not sound like a real piano it sounds like a child's toy. I kinda want to send it back but don't want to go through the hassle at the same time
"
Annette DeSimone,4.0,2017 28 December,"
Cute. Got it for my daughter..she’s 8. The sound good but she likes the microphone the Best lol! A little pricey

 When my product came the tape pull on of the keys off
"
Heather stewart,3.0,2018 22 April,"
It is great for my daughter but the volume preset is so loud. My 5 year old doesn’t understand that it’s too loins and I’m constantly having to try and turn it down. If it wasn’t for this I would have rated it much higher.

"
April,4.0,2017 21 May,"
The straps to hold the keyboard onto the stand are confusing and it sits crooked. The keyboard is nice and it sounds great!
"
Robin Zehm,3.0,2017 17 February,"
This was a gift for my daughter.  The product is as described however the sound was not what we anticipated and when it is first turned on, the volume is at max, then needs to be turned down.  The keys are a little flimsy but okay for someone beginning to learn.
"
The Angelo Show!,4.0,2018 19 March,"
My daughter loves it. It's not too sturdy but overall for the money, it's prety good.

was given to 10 yr old for x-mas . great introductory keyboard.  would have been nice to have headphones included, butcertainly not a deal breaker.
"
KD,5.0,2017 27 December,"
Great! Easy and very little set up. I live in an apartment complex and was worried about the noise but this keyboard has a headphone jack and the sound quality is still good when you use it.

great set. good sound at low volume. The speaker isnt that good at higher volume...
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2016 11 November,"
Good. I like it, but I don't like the guide manual. They should tell me how to install the case and more on using the piano.

"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2016 27 December,"
It was everything I expected this instrument  was for my 9 year old son. When he opened it we had a blast with it.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2017 16 May,"
It's a very good price, and sets up nicely & pretty solidly. But it does sound ""tinny"" (electronic) to us. We can't find a setting (among over 100+ options!) that sounds close to a real piano, as we have been able to do on other electronic keyboards.
"
Shep,5.0,2019 10 February,"
Very prompt delivery, arrived almost a week early, everything expected for an electric keyboard. Lovely sound quality, perfect tune. Extremely underpriced, buy while you can
"
Victoria Ramos-Glew,3.0,2018 14 May,"
The keys were smaller than I was expecting. It would probably be okay for a beginning player, but my son is a little more advanced and we were looking for something that he'd be able to use indefinitely.
"
The Jammy,5.0,2018 1 April,"
I ordered this keyboard because my grandson wanted to learn how to play. He was thrilled with it for a beginner. He has been learning and having a lot of fun with it.
"
M. M M.,5.0,2017 22 July,"
I love this keyboard.  Hadn't played piano for years and wanted to try again. Lightweight and compact, just as depicted.  One small issue is the music stand is a bit flimsy but overall--great for the price.
"

"
NaN da MaN,1.0,2019 27 November,"
To sum it up, here’s a rhyme:It clearly wasn’t worth my time,Worth actually only a dime,I regret my purchase,And think this thing should be sent below the surface.Although it claims to have 255 rhythms,It has a mere 15 (which are cataclysms)I do not think it’s worth it’s cost,And would rather just get lost.I know no piano as crappy as this,Which is why, I’m in fact, making this diss.For its quality, I give it a solid 2/10,For the piece of garbage I have is a good device for no men.

CHA221,1.0,2020 25 December,"
Don't ever buy this. We are extremely disappointed. We bought this for our daughter for the Christmas. She opened the present in the morning and tried to play but there is no sound coming other than a grrrr sound and some static noise. We even tried with batteries thinking it could be the power adapter But no luck. It was definitely a defective one. This was the worst thing I ever bought from Amazon. It just ruined my daughter's Christmas, she was so sad coz her Christmas gift was not working.

Serves me right for buying a musical instrument from Amazon I guess.  Bought as a Christmas gift for my niece,  she was very excited about it until she opened the box and found 3 keys broken or jammed or something,  then she was very disappointed.  I should of checked it before I gave it to her I guess,  that’s my bad, but now I’m out money for repackaging because I through away all the boxes,  I should get a refund for that to and the time invested in sending it back my time is valuable.

Amazon Customer,2.0,2018 26 January,"
So it is a electric piano. But it does not sound like one at all. It has several sounds it can do but very few sound like what they are supposed to. The Keys are very small (playable) and sometimes plays other notes. The stand it came with is nice and easy to assemble. But that’s probably the only good thing about it.

There were 7 keys they were pushed up and not working. Looking through the reviews I see a lot of other people having this problem. I was able to fix it by taking the back off and pushing them into place, but it was way too much work for the amount of money I spent on this. I wouldn’t recommend this product at all.

Bob,2.0,2017 28 November,"
The keys were shorter than I expected, but I suppose that's standard for the price of such a keyboard. But the worst part is the return policy. I have to pay $15 to ship it back, which I was not anticipating because that's never happened on an amazon prime product. Don't buy if you're not sure you want to keep this!

Max,2.0,2017 28 July,"
Honestly wasn't expecting the keys to be quite as small as they were.. this was a piano made for little people. Sounds pretty ""meh"" to be honest.. Not bad for the price, but definitely not good. If you are looking to seriously get into piano, this is not for you.. This is a product for playing around/ tinkering with..
"
Giselle,1.0,2020 25 March,"
As someone who plays the piano, this ‘piano’ if you can even call it that is just straight up trash. The sound quality is just horrible and the microphone is really cheap too, I mean you do get what you pay for... I’d only recommend this piano for children but not for people who want to learn how to play, if you do want to learn how to play, save some cash up and buy something nicer than this garbage.

Jesse S.,1.0,2020 15 July,"
Lighter than a laptop. If you turn the volume down the sound only comes thru one speaker. Sounds blown. Microphone is trash, sounds like talking over a loud speaker in a walmart 10 years ago. In total its all worth maybe 10$ at a yard sale. 1$ microphone 7$ keyboard 2$ stand. Actually the stand is the only thing i dont have a problem with.

Josie,1.0,2019 31 May,"
I bought this for Christmas so my daughter could learn how to play piano.  Not sure if they keys worked originally but at least 5 keys don't make any sound at all.  Sort of makes it difficult when you are learning piano.  I rarely review things on Amazon but this feedback needed to be heard.  I would return or exchange but I'm past the window.

Mark Stapleton,1.0,2018 30 December,"
Very upset with this product, I gave it to my son as a Christmas present and the description said that it came with a keyboard stand. We search and double checked all the boxes to find no stand anywhere to be found. If this product says in the description that it has something that comes with it then it should be there upon opening the box.
"
Mom of 4 Son Team,1.0,2017 11 November,"
Purchased this for my college son to have in his dorm, but it is way too small for his hands and the sound quality is so poor that he doesn't even want to play it.  Wish I'd realized this prior to the close of the return window.  Makes me to want to buy from a vendor with a better return policy.  Disappointed in this item and disappointed that Amazon doesn't give a bit more time for returns.

W. Skye,1.0,2017 10 May,"
This keyboard does not have any sort of dynamic response; that is, whether you hit a key softly, or if you hit it hard, or with a hammer, the tone comes out at exactly the same volume.  Even absolute beginners need the ability to at least attempt to play at a piano or forte volume level.  Tone quality is poor - you really have to use your imagination to convince yourself it sounds anything like an acoustic piano.  Don't waste your money.
"
Amy Butler,3.0,2017 12 May,"
The stand is lopsided and the bars on the stand are uneven.
"
Steven Giacoma,1.0,2017 4 August,"
Would give it 0 stars of it would let me. I wanted a keyboard and this was a cheap option with mostly good reviews. It came. It sucked. I threw it away. If you actually want to play music, then find a different keyboard even if it's more expensive. This one resets to highest volume every 7 minutes. It plays every instrument except one that sounds like a piano! Overall terrible purchase. Never again.

Tiffany Jetton,1.0,2019 1 May,"
This product is just sad. I didn’t have high expectations at all when purchasing, after all it’s under $100. But at a minimum I expected it to sound slightly like a piano. Instead it sounds more like a kids toy. It has over 100 sound options...but half of them sound exactly the same and all are laughable. Very disappointed.

Lower keys didn't hold the note, sound quality was poor overall and microphone was very ""breathy"".  All this, and they didn't send screws for the flimsy stand.  This is just not worth the money for anyone interested in a decent piano sound.  We invested a bit more and got a Yamaha 235 and it is a significantly better sounding and performing piano!!

The keys are too sensitive and on occasion play the note 2 or three times when only struck once. I am also surprised that Hamzer or their distributor Mix-Wholesale don't  supply a customer service or technical support contact number. Not good! Looks as if they don't stand behind their produduct. A bad buy, bad product, no customer service!

it feels like a toy quality. static noise from speakers that is worse when microphone is pugged in. when turned on it defaults to the loudest volume and does not remember the last volume setting. ordered new, received open box and missing two out of four bars that supposed to hold the stand in place rendering the stand of no use.

Got this as a starter keyboard for my kid and didn’t expect much, but this thing is a disappointment. For starters the 255 timbers/ tones all sound about the same; from violin to grand piano, they sound about the same. Every time you power it on the volume starts at 10. I’m hard of hearing and can hear tones from the headphones in the other room. I am constantly telling my kid to turn it down as he just goes with the default. So not good for beginners. The stand and seat are the only decent items from the keyboard kit. Do yourself, and youngsters, a favor and keep shopping.

Quality for the price! Bought this for our grandson who's 5 and learning to play the piano. He needed a key board to practice and this has worked out great. Sturdy and has straps that secure board to the stand. The mic that comes with it is all plastic, but other than that I'm very satisfied with it. Sound and tones are great too. Has my recommendation.

Bought as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old niece who wanted to learn to play piano.  She loves it.  ""Awesome"" was her word.  Good starter piano with decent sound for a reasonable price.

Great quality for the money. Great sound. Purchased for 10 year old Granddaughter to learn on. Excellent quality for even adults. Love the additional stand that came with it.

Terry Gump,3.0,2018 17 December,"
I am disappointed that the volume is so high.  I purchased this for my 6-year g-grandson for Christmas.  Because there are other children in the house, I also purchased separately some earphones so he could play the piano and not disturb anyone else in the house.  When I turn on the piano, and plug in the earphones, the volume is so high, I am concerned for his ears.  I won't be there to monitor his use of this piano.  I may have to give him my personal keyboard.

This piano was a Christmas gift 2018 for my 16yr old daughter who loves music and musical theater. We didnt get to put up the stand that came with the piano up yet but it was included. It arrived earlier then expected, great quality and perfect for lots of practicing for a beginner. I highly recommend.
"
John D,5.0,2019 21 January,"
I needed a lower priced keyboard. I am retired and now I finally have time to learn to play piano/ keyboard. This keyboard is great. The sound is excellent, the layout is excellent and this keyboard is superior and has features the higher priced casio’s & yamaha’s have. Hamzer  should market many more models and they would be in the top 5 ratings. Thank you Hamzer.

christine,2.0,2016 28 October,"
First, whoever amazon used for delivery... they dropped it off at the wrong apartment but the older lady came to my door to tell me a package was at her house for me. I am glad I have honest neighbors. That did not have any affect on my review.I understand it's electronic. (My mom bought this as a birthday present. She didn't know there was a difference) but this plays like a child's toy piano.The stand IS flimsy. If you are playing and find that you are into your music just be careful because it might fall over. It is easy to put together though. Like 5 minutes. The mic is garbage for an adult but I think children would love it.I would not recommend this product for an adult.

Sounds great. Least liked is the volume could not be turned down further. Just need to get some head phones.
"
Andrew Roche,2.0,2020 20 April,"
Cheaply made keys, interference with sound when phone is near by, and no matter what setting you choose on the keyboard it will never sound like a traditional piano or ""normal."" Good for beginners though.

"
Josiah M Traeger,1.0,2020 29 March,"
The keys are small, my fingers can't fit throught the black keys so my playing is limited. The sound quality is pretty bad, I had a cheap Yamaha keyboard given to me and it was a lot better than this. Especially the fact that this keyboard can't use a pedal which takes away from the availability in dynamics in your playing.I'd say it's not worth this price. If you can get a different one then do so.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2016 29 December,"
This was a Christmas present for my husband who is learning to play. He has a beautiful voice and wants to record in the near future. He was actually looking at the same one unbeknownst to me. He was SUPER SURPRISED AND HAPPY!
"
Rachel Rose,2.0,2018 30 May,"
It’d just be nicer if they said it only had 15 sound options. Whether you pick rhythm or timbre, there are only 15 options that cycle through. Also the keys are small and it does feel like a toy. It’s a fine product if you just want to learn keys without paying hundreds of dollars. However, I’m unsure if there are also cheap options with better keyboards.
"
Susan R.,5.0,2017 16 October,"
Terrific product!
"
Annalisa Hiroyasu,1.0,2020 15 January,"
After about 1 month, the sound on the keyboard completely shut off. I wasn’t able to fix it. The keyboard itself would turn on but no sound could be heard, even with headphones plugged in. Right before the sound shut of. There was a spark noise from inside the keyboard and a weird smell coming from inside. Would not recommend for long term use.
"
Anonomys,2.0,2017 7 December,"
The price may be very tempting, but I would not buy this keyboard. The stand is not the best, the sound this product produce sounds very buzzy, and don't get me started on the keys. They all feel like loose teeth and are as light as a feather. The quality is quite poor, and I am just saying: It will save you money in the long run to get a different keyboard. This one is not good what so ever.
"

Haley,2.0,2018 18 March,"
It definitely does a lot of things but in my opinion should have spent more time focusing on sound quality than the 255 outdated rhythms and demo songs... but for a cheaper keyboard it gets the job done...

EliteReviewsUSA,4.0,2019 28 October,"
Generally cheap piano and the quality of it's build is not that great. It's pre-loaded with a lot of instruments, which is pretty nice actually. The mic is complete trash and feels like a $3 toy.Some of the settings for recording were too complicated and ended up not working a few times. I wish I bought something a bit more pricey and of quality.

It’s the cutest little bike. Comes with the tool needed to assemble. Super easy to assemble. Took my husband like 5 min. We got it for our grandbabys first birthday.

I bought this for my 1 year old nephew. It was easy to assemble and the quality felt great. We put him on it, he took one step and it fell over-- he cried. He wanted nothing to do with it after that. I think over time he will get it, but beware...a helmet is necessary especially in the beginning!

Item was described as having a “damaged box” when in actuality the item had been completely opened to the point where screws were missing and I had to go to buy some to properly and SAFELY assemble and likely even used as the handles were discolored../ a complete rip off
"
pb909,5.0,2022 18 July,"
This was a birthday gift for my granddaughter, she's one.  She is just learning to take steps but is able to get on this and move it with her feet.  She also likes to stand in front of it and push it.  It's a little tippy so someone always walks with her.  Remember to adjust the height of the seat!
"

"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2022 26 August,"
Bought this when grand daugther was 14 months and she didn't play with it, but knew it was hers and just carried it around a little. Surprisingly she started to sit on it recently and push it along (22 months). She seen other toddlers a bit older ride this type of bike and she kind of took it upon herself to try it out. We'll see how she plays with this now, but she's almost outgrown it!
"
Dr. Kelsey,3.0,2022 7 August,"
I bought this for my daughter at the end of May for her first birthday. She didn’t figure it out well and wasn’t interested. I brought it back out 8 weeks later and she’s much more interested. But she’s taller and the seat needs to be adjusted. The screw to adjust the seat is basically impossible to remove. So this bike is honestly completely useless.I still gave 3 stars because it has potential to be awesome. I wish it was easier to contact sellers and get help. My daughter is ready to ride this but it can’t be adjusted.

"
Brian Schroeder,3.0,2022 29 August,"
I have a few models of these bikes and I will say, this is the kids least favorite. It’s not as easy to glide on as the bikes with 2 rear wheels close together. This one just collects dust, while the other style of these balance bikes at the house are used non stop.

I wish this adjusted to bigger sizes, but it’s really just for brave 1 year-olds. My 2 year-old barely fits on it.
"
Allyson Small,4.0,2022 23 February,"
This balance bike says for 12 month olds. I would say it’s good for 18+ month olds due to height of the lowest setting and coordination. Other than that, the light pink is adorable and it glides smoothly across the floor.
"
JLN,5.0,2022 16 June,"
Purchased for my one year old niece’s birthday. She isn’t walking yet but got up on the bike and was pushing herself around. The balance wheel on the back will be great to gain stability. Highly recommend.
"
D. Leazer,3.0,2022 12 May,"
Bought this because it said like new.  When it arrived the box was faded which didn’t matter as long as the item was in good working condition. The box had also been taped and retapped numerous times. After opening and trying to assemble we found that there were multiple parts missing. This is the reason it has been taped and returned time and time again. This also tells me that someone isn’t reading why the item is being return.  I gave it a 2 star for assembling because of the missing parts. If they were all there it would have been very simple. As for sturdiness it would be better if it had two wheels in the back especially for a one year old.
"
Christina Marie Nichols,3.0,2022 15 August,"

"
Kimberley,4.0,2021 21 December,"
Great bike and easy to assemble. He likes it, however he is a bit too big for it. He is tall for just turning two . It would be nice if handle bars raised as well! Will be better for the next grandchild. Parents are over six feet tall. He is not the average two year old height,so had I bought this around 18 months, he would have been shorter!
"
Gigi,4.0,2022 21 January,"
I bought this for when my baby granddaughter grows. So we will see. The seat seemed hard and narrow. I would think uncomfortable but we will see if she likes it. I will update later on. It was well made and sturdy though.
"
Mary,5.0,2022 20 March,"
Very sad how flimsy the bike it. It was finally warm enough this past week to take it out, rode it maybe 5 times and the wheel fell off. No way to get the bearing back on and make it sturdy again to use.
"
Jared M.,5.0,2022 12 February,"
My 18month old loves this bike! She is average in size and rode it on the first try. I like that the seat is adjustable, as some others are not, which is why we bought this one. Definitely worth the money for the 6months or so that she’ll use it and then pass on to the thrift store or a friend!
"
kim5875,3.0,2022 2 May,"
This is so cute and I was hoping my child could use it to scoot around but the single wheel in the back causes it to tip very easily. If you’re considering one of these, I would recommend going for one that has 2 wheels in the back
"
Michelle DeRicco,5.0,2022 13 February,"
My 15 month old has been trying to use her bike. We use it inside on carpets for now because she does tend to fall off but she’s getting the hang of it. I’m sure by the time she’s 18 months, she will be a pro. Great purchase.
"
Taylor,2.0,2022 15 October,"
My daughter had a hard time with this bike. The handle bars should be a bit higher for better balancing/stability. Design needs to be worked on a bit.
"
Caitlin,5.0,2022 26 March,"
This is my one year old’s favorite toy. He figured out how to use it himself after 3 tries. I do wish the seat was adjustable.
"
Amanda E,5.0,2020 10 August,"
My one year old daughter loves this bike. It took her a couple of days to figure out to sit down on the seat. She’s 31 inches tall and it’s a good height for her. Would work for a shorter or taller child too.  She rides it through the house and over to the front door and asks us to take her outside with it. It’s very low to the ground and lightweight, so when she has occasionally tipped over on it she doesn’t fall hard and nothing on the bike hurts her. She definitely doesn’t comprehend steering or turning, yet. She pushes it along until she bumps into something then waits for us to turn her in a different direction. I think it’s going to be great to teach her some basic bike skills like steering and balance before we actually get her a real bike.
"
Cynthia Light,5.0,2022 10 May,"

"
Kyli Bedinghaus,4.0,2021 14 April,"
My daughter is 17 months old. She really seemed to like it at first but then it falls over when she tries to get off of it and so she's a little leery of it. It was easy to put together but my husband accidentally put the handlebars on backwards and we had to go through quite a bit to get them back on the right way. That was our fault though. Overall I'm hoping that she will like it when she gets a little older.
"
C-Bus,5.0,2020 28 January,"
I’m so happy with this purchase. I waffled between this 3 wheel bike or a 4 wheel. My 17m old is very speedy & comfortable on his current 4 wheel bike but it’s very light weight plastic & doesn’t have the ability to steer easily. I worried he’d struggle too much with this one & not be interested, but, also, didn’t want to not challenge him if he was ready. He’s GREAT on it! He got on & wobbled a little, fell once, and then was all over the place. He’s tumbling a few times but he gets on again & loves this bike so so much. I wouldn’t recommend it for a child who’s not already established on a 4 wheel bike but if you think your kid is ready for a challenge this is a great place to start. The handle bar turns a little, the wheels are smooth and it very simple to assemble.
"
Linda,5.0,2022 12 April,"
Bike is easy to assemble and very sturdy
"
Mike,4.0,2020 2 June,"
Bike was extremely easy to assemble. Just connect handles to the bike and tighten down with the provided allen wrench.Tried dropping the seat, but couldn't. The tube allowing seat adjustment is flared inwards at the end (to allow easier drop in), so it can be filed down while keeping the same max height.My friend's daughter could barely reach the ground with her toes. She is a year old, but she is short for her age. This will not be a problem for most. She will grow into it or she can wear shoes and be able to reach it better. My friend may grind down the seat tube to lower it more.
"
texasqueen,5.0,2021 25 August,"
This was a birthday gift for my 1 year old great granddaughter. It was very simple to assemble it took minutes. As soon as she saw it she was on it an scooting herself down the hall. One great feature is that the handle bars turn in a slightly restricted manner that helps avoid spills caused by abrupt turns. I ordered the pink and white the color was vibrant. All in all this was a well received gift.
"
JB,5.0,2021 30 December,"

I had gotten a similar balance bike for my nephew (13m) which was really awesome. This one was a little different, which was ok cause my daughters (18m) a little older. Its pretty easy to assemble, but my nephews was so much easier. And its not as sturdy as my nephews, as this only as 3 wheels instead of 4, but my daughter really likes it and it helps her learn to balance better.

"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2021 11 December,"
The bike is exactly what I expected and seems to be pretty good quality. The only annoying issue is that the Allen wrench and socket to tighten the seat seems almost stripped and is very hard to turn without it popping out. It’s not worth the hassle of returning but is definitely annoying!

My 8 year old was able to put this together, it was that easy. Such a fun gift for my niece. She loved it!  Highly recommend!
"
DFranck,4.0,2020 7 May,"
Really cute.  It assembled in minutes.  Good quality and perfect size for my tall 1 year old.  Only issue I found is that it does tip over easily if he’s not balancing properly.  I know it’s a balance bike and so therefore he needs to be balancing while using it but he’s still learning and so we had to be right there helping him for a while until he finally got it. Not a big deal. I still highly recommend this little bike

M.F.,5.0,2021 17 March,"
My nephew turned 1 and this has become his ultimate favorite toy. It was so simple to put together. Didn’t even need the instructions. There isn’t any annoying sound makers on it so the parents will thank you. My nephew even determined that the handle bars are perfect for teething babies... I have officially leveled up to best auntie ever status. Highly suggest this to all aunties/uncles, parents, and grandparents. You will not regret it.

Meghan B.,3.0,2022 25 January,"
Super cute and my daughter loved it but back wheel broke the first week we had it. Not able to find replacement parts
"
OptimusPrime,5.0,2020 14 June,"
I somehow stumbled over this balance bike for my 14mths old. I am glad I did stick with the 2 front and 1 back wheel instead of 2 back wheels. Impressed with the quality of the bike.- Well designed. Well made.- Well constructed. Pretty sturdy.- Installation takes hardly 5mins. Easy install.- Amazing looking bike. Color choice is just awesome. It's a good looking bike. Loving my baby's Orange color. It's like the Orange cream color.- Rides smoothly.So far no cons. Good quality, seems durable and sturdy. Worth recommending and a good gift option.

The Toddler Bike is cute but it had practicality problem! Unfortunately, the handlebars cannot turn when the Toddler Bike was installed, I must ask to make exchange. If it still has same problem, I must ask return.
"
Vaughna Schooler,4.0,2021 5 January,"
My daughter loves this! We purchased it for her 2nd birthday and she can scoot around on it really well. I do wish the handle bars could go up higher though because she is on the small side as is and the bars are very low.
"
Nathan,5.0,2021 3 March,"
Bought for my 2 year old to scoot around the house with. He is shorter than average so it still works well for him. It is taller than some of the other balance bikes.  He enjoys it, and I like that the seat is adjustable. My 4 year old even tries to take a spin on it every so often, and it holds up to her too.
"
Peter Armitage,4.0,2021 30 July,"

"
Francisco & Christina,2.0,2022 18 June,"
We got this as a birthday gift and the day of the party it took my husband 15 mins and seriousMuscle power. He said the cutouts of the  handle and the bottom wheel did not line up.
"
snowflake2312,3.0,2021 7 September,"
The only bike my 18 month old loved was the Chilafish green and white one (which my husband ran over with his truck on accident)…. This one and the other ones here are harder to turn for her because the handle bar and front wheels are larger so she won’t have fun on this until she’s 2

"
M,5.0,2020 29 October,"
This came assembled. Perfect bike for a 1 year old. She could handle the bike so easily even if they can’t walk yet. She felt like she could keep up with her older brother by riding bikes with him. I love this concept of no pedals. The kids love it! Bike is made well. We were extremely happy with this purchase, would buy it again. It’s a great gift, hit of the party!
"
Archis A,5.0,2021 23 January,"
This bike is good for a toddler and is relatively stable. Ours is for a 15 month old who is around 30 inches tall. He did not like it when younger so maybe that is something to consider. Our only gripe was that the handle bar is not height adjustable so it might get awkward once you start changing the height of the seat.
"
Vernell Carr,4.0,2021 12 July,"
love it
"
Helen,4.0,2021 11 January,"
It would of been easy to assemble but it was bent from shipping. We got it fixed enough to put together. My almost 2 year old would rather carry it around than ride it. :)
"
Lacey Blake,4.0,2020 28 June,"
Only gave 4 stars because the seat adjusts but the handlebars do not. As my toddler keeps growing, I can move the seat up but she has to hunch over to use the handlebars. Everything else is great but we would get so much more use from adjustable handle bars.
"
ARH,3.0,2020 5 May,"
So I have an obsession with yellow which my 1yo daughter has also picked up. So we were very excited for this. However she was slow to get into using this until her 2yo friend used his while she visited. Then she used it a few times always under a minute... I kept it outside in our covered patio area always.I noticed that the handle bars were grossly eroded and there was rust around all screws. This is unacceptable to me having only bought it a little Over a month ago and She barely noticed it until a couple weeks ago.So I’m returning it. I didn’t reach out to the seller first which i normally do so no clue if they're receptive or helpful.
"
A Martin,4.0,2019 13 November,"
We got this for our son on his first birthday. It was quick assembly unfortunately he is still a little short at 1 yo to maneuver it since his legs barely touch. With the two wheels in front they have to be able to use their legs more to keep them from falling over. He will grow into it and get better once he is a more stable walker I’m sure
"
rachel,5.0,2020 6 December,"
This light weight bike was easy to assemble. It’s sturdy and hasn’t caused any issues yet. It rolls well and came with the parts to adjust the height so she can use it as she grows. She just walks with it right now but it’s a good introductory at least to bike riding and gives a new activity to do
"
Samantha McGuier,4.0,2021 17 April,"
Easy to assemble.I bought it for my one year old and it’s the perfect height for her
"
Marisa Toepfer,5.0,2021 25 January,"
Balance bike for my one year old. She is a little short for it. She has to be in her tippy toes but can easily push it forward! She will be able to use it for awhile especially since it has an adjustable seat.Great purchase, would definitely recommend to other parents!
"
Jaimie,3.0,2021 26 September,"
Good quality but a little difficult for our almost two year old to ride. It only has one back wheel so I feel like it tips over pretty easily.
"
 Angel,5.0,2021 29 March,"
My daughter started at 10 months. She loves it! She can't walk or crawl yet but she sure knows how to ride this bike!Please be careful and don't let your child ride unsupervised. They can fall and get injured in a split second!
"
T Blankenship,5.0,2021 30 October,"
Easy assembly, helps prepare toddler for balancing a big bicycle
"
joey,4.0,2019 9 November,"
I bought this for my little girl on her 1st birthday. A little young maybe but I wanted to introduce it early so she’d be comfortable on two wheels sooner than later. She hasn’t totally gotten the hang of it but shows interest. It seems to be durable and it light weight which makes packing it around great. Highly recommend.
"
Josh,3.0,2021 8 July,"
Very easy to put together, however it’s not very sturdy. The back wheel makes the bike tip over easily. If I were to buy this type of bike again I would definitely purchase one with a double back wheel and front wheel so that’s it’s more sturdy.
"
eric martinez,5.0,2020 20 May,"
My one yr old is kinda short but he very much wants to keep up with his sister and wants to ride a bike too. The first week he kept falling and I was even thinking about returning it but now he’s able to balance and he’s riding around everywhere on it! Definitely recommend this bike but make sure to give the littles ones time to adjust.
"
Bonnie VanDeVusse,4.0,2021 27 February,"
Solid, quality balance bike.  Made for little ones but tips easily with the 3 wheels.
"
Josue Rendon,4.0,2020 27 October,"
The bike is pretty, looks great. However, isn’t so much stable. On the other hand, the height of the sit isn’t so much ajustable, only a little bit.
"
Carolyn,4.0,2021 6 January,"

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 For a 12 month old, she was a bit timid, but after a few days she loves it.  Her feet barely touches the ground, so we have to be with her 100% of the time, but we can imagine how much fun she will have once she is a bit older. Good quality bike for a toddler.

"
Andrea,4.0,2019 22 July,"
My 1 year old can navigate this bike fairly well. She is slightly smaller than an average one year old, so she is still on top toes but it doesn't stop her from scooting around quickly. The handlebar doesn't allow for too sharp of turns (thank goodness for those of us whose toddlers have no fear). Incredibly simple to assemble.
"
Bilman,2.0,2022 13 February,"
The assembly looks to be easy.  Need to fix the handlebar with the front wheel.  Unfortunately that one screw is missing in the box.  I know how the bike performs, if I figure out a way to get that screw and assemble the bike.
"
Novelette,5.0,2020 28 September,"
This was much sturdier than I thought it was going to be.  Well made and was very easy to put together.  I just wish the seat could go a little lower. The wheels are very quite on all surfaces. I would buy again.

My granddaughter just started walking, about 2 weeks before her 1st birthday, she likes pushing it around, but cannot sit on it and balance just yet.  Seat needs to be adjustable.  But I like it, as easy assembly and wheels and seat are soft.

Yikes. I had high hopes for this little bike, but the wheels were so wobbly — even after I tried to tighten the bolts — that there’s no way my 19-month-old can use it. The seat also doesn’t really adjust, and the wheels are super cheap plastic. Maybe I just got a particularly bad one off the assembly line, but oof.

This bike is really cute and my 1 year old granddaughter loved sitting on it. The reason for this poor review is it was poorly made.

Easy to assemble but the dimensions are very odd. I would recommend going with a different bike!! The seat is adjustable (height) but the handle bar isn’t which makes no sense to me!!! If you adjust the seat higher because you have a taller or growing child then the handle bar still stays low and it’s super awkward!!
"
jay o.,2.0,2021 3 April,"
It’s cute and all however, it’s very hard for babies to keep balance and it’s quite dangerous when they do fall to the side. Wish they could of put some sort of training wheels for stability. Don’t recommend this product, I don’t feel secure when my daughter gets on it.
"

The toy Came used missing screw and screw key everything was just thrown in  the box .

Horrible.Do not spend money on this.Wobbly and no sturdiness. The handlebars are lower and outward from the seat, and my 23 month old fell off onto her face. Busted her lips open.The worst buy we ever did.0 stars!!!!!!

 Huge disappointment for my granddaughter
"
Laura,1.0,2020 22 September,"
I bought this online for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday.  She is a normal size 2 year old, but his bike was way too small for her.  The handlebar does not adjust at all even though the seat does.  For the price, I was expecting something much nicer.  I have already packed it up to return it.  I would not recommend buying this bike.
"
Elena DeCristino,1.0,2021 22 April,"
It was way smaller and super unsteady! Definitely not for a 1 year old or any child for that matter. The handle bar was so low it was almost impossible to really teach the little one to sit on it. I had to send it back.
"
Dan J,1.0,2020 15 May,"
We purchased the blue option and when it arrived the box looked like it was a returned item as the box was sealed in a way that looked rushed. Upon inspecting the parts we noticed some scrapes and areas where there were signs of use. The item page did not state that the option was refurbished so it was a bit of a let down to find these Knicks and bruises on the item.
"
Edwin Quinones,1.0,2021 25 July,"
I purchased this for my 18 months old niece, she looked at it, and picked up like a toy and carried it away. Even with the sit adjusted it did nothing for her.
"
PATTI BRADY,1.0,2021 5 May,"
Not for toddlers as advertised. Way too small for a 18 month old. Seat height does not adjust. I’m hoping it can be returned even if it has been assembled and used once outside.

Cute and appears to be sturdy. Should have been snap to assemble BUT - hole in fork and wheels do not line up! Poor quality control, has to go back!

The holw in the handlebars does not line up with the hole in the frame so we can't attach them properly! Boo!
"
christina,1.0,2020 31 March,"
I bought this for my 2 year old who is average in size and it's so small she cant even move on it. The handle bars are so short and so close to the seat it's impossible for her to ride. Such a disappointment!
"
Gina ,3.0,2022 17 September,"
Received ahead of a birthday party. Was excited to get, as I’ve already purchased this in the past and loved it. But this time, the box came clearly retaped and dented - it was obviously returned. I don’t feel comfortable gifting this…. And don’t have time to repurchase. Will return.
"
Theresa,1.0,2021 16 February,"
The holes didn’t line up and when we finally got the screws in, they popped out within a week. Not worth the money!
"
Chelsy Shore,1.0,2021 29 March,"
This is the second bike we have gotten. Both of them have broken at the front wheel axel.
"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2020 8 June,"
Very disappointing.  Don’t know why it’s called balance bike. Easily tips over. Not suitable at all for a early age walker. The three year old didn’t keep it upright either.  A pricey purchase.

 It’s a nice idea so the little ones can have a little bike like their siblings!
"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2020 7 August,"
Entirely too small for any toddler that can walk. Poorly designed, handles are too low for a child to maneuver. Front wheels are too close together it doesn’t prevent kids from tipping over.
"

Didn't last 2 weeks, rear wheel kept falling off.

This is NOT a safe product. As soon as the front wheel is turned in any direction the whole trike tips over.
"
Lisa L.,1.0,2020 25 February,"
I was so disappointed when I received this item. It was so small and looked like a cheap gift, that I returned it immediately. The seat appeared larger than the bike.
"
Dennis,1.0,2019 30 October,"
Returned this trike for a more sturdy because it tips over constantly and is dangerous. Only has one wheel in the back that contributes to this.
"
Shyniece McGennis,1.0,2020 11 February,"
The bike was not sturdy. My daughter didn’t even ride it for 5 minutes before falling off. I returned it.

Our LO only steps out the house on her balance bike, she's. 1.5yrs  rides it fast even maintaining balance while speeding through turns, has really helped with her development and confidence building. A minor malfuntion happened to the rear wheel, allobebe sent us a whole new balance bike the next day, customer service could not be better! 5 stars for the bike AND customer service.

After reading the reviews we got this bike - it has great reviews! But my daughter is constantly tipping this thing over and falling! It’s not sturdy/stable at all. It doesn’t turn very well either. Definitely not what I was expecting based on all the good reviews.
"

"
KT - Six Eight Tall,1.0,2022 2 March,"
Was excited to receive as a gift from a relative whose kids loved this toy however the plastic molding does not allow the center handlebar to fit fully into the front wheel support which causes a huge safety hazard to my toddler. Customer support hasn’t responded to help address this situation. Please be careful that the parts fully connect before using and good luck seeing support if there is a problem.
"
Samantha Johnson,5.0,2021 27 February,"
My niece loved it for you birthday gift.
"
Dominique j,3.0,2021 14 May,"
I’m very confused with all the positive reviews. I received this bike as a gift so I can’t return. My child constantly falls off and gets hurt as soon as she turns the wheel. Not sturdy at all. Definitely needs two wheels on the back. It looks cute but not functional at all.
"
Elizabeth,1.0,2022 10 January,"
My daughter loves this bike so much. It was outside on the patio for a few months and the grips were destroyed. So we just bought some new grips to match a few weeks ago to replace them. But now the forks just broke and she’s so sad. There’s no fixing it. I didn’t expect it to make it through multiple kids, but also didn’t expect it to break after 6 months either and am really disappointed.Buyer beware that this won’t last.If the seller will please contact me and send me a new piece to replace the broken one (seems like just the fork piece) I would really appreciate it and I’ll update my review with the details.

Carrollable,3.0,2021 12 January,"
I won't describe how difficult it was to get this together only to realize it's too small. My Granddaughter is just over a year old. She is too big for it. The toddler on the front of the box is too big for it.  The parts don't fit together very well. I'm so upset that I put all the time, money and effort into this to end up not giving it to her. My son in law took one look and agreed that it was way too small. It's cute, but just too small for a toddler. Disappointed Grandma

"
Applesandpaint,1.0,2021 5 July,"
This balance bike was incredibly easy to put together and had all the required tools in the box. BUT the bike is really really small. I don’t know how the age range is up to 36 months. It is way too small for my 18 month old and she could not ride it.
"

"
Andrew,1.0,2020 14 July,"
This product was defective.  On the one I received, the collar on the handlebars was not properly aligned, making the entire front end unstable.  I removed the screws to see if it could be adjusted, but no luck (unless I wanted to drill and tap new holes).  I’m returning it.

Taryn,1.0,2020 13 April,"
Got this for my daughter for her 1st bday and the handle bars seem to not be sturdy at all, not sure if I got some defective or it’s just adult proof assembly. I screwed the handle bars into the front wheel like the instructions said and the handle bars rock back and forth not sturdy at all.

"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 10 September,"
So far we really like this little bike. We bought this for my daughter for her first birthday. She hasn't started walking yet, so her balance isn't the greatest, but she can stay on this bike pretty well by herself. She can't get into it herself yet, but when we put her on she has a great time pushing herself around the living room. I anticipate lots of use when she gets big enough to use it all by herself.
"
Kimlee,4.0,2021 20 September,"
The bike is darling and will workout fine, however when the front wheel rolls there are pieces in the wheel that make a noise,

Cate Larsen,5.0,2021 8 April,"
We love this bike for our little grand niece--who we spoil a lot and still hope she grows up to make a positive difference in this world, even if she's spoiled rotten by us. She was thrilled on her 1st birthday because her older brothers both have their own bikes. Now she gets to ride hers too. It doesn't have any foot stirrups. She's just going to think she's riding while she walks along and steers the direction of the bike. It's helping her keep her balance while walking.
"

"
Becca,5.0,2021 15 December,"
I bought this for my granddaughter‘s first birthday. She really likes it, but she is pretty short. The seat does not move up or down, so there’s no adjustability to this. However, we would push her around on it even though her toes couldn’t touch the floor.

Perfect size and fit for our granddaughter. Perfect way to gain her ability to learn to walk. Wheels are thick enough to keep the bike from tipping over. Pretty bright colors.

Jackson B.,5.0,2022 18 April,"
My daughter loves this bike. It is sturdy and seems less like a balance bike. She is 2, and she prefers this to the 2 wheel bikes. She is gaining a lot of confidence with this bike so much so that she is starting to feel more comfortable on the 2 wheeled bike.
"
Melissa Yunke,5.0,2021 19 April,"
This balance bike was an upgrade from another balance bike with wider tires for my 19 month old. She took to it immediately and uses it multiple times a day. It’s light enough that she can pick it up and carry it but also sturdy enough that this mama feels safe with her riding it. It really does feel more like a real bike than most of the balance bikes out there... we’ve tried a few. The metal frame and materials used for the handlebar grips and seat feel like they’re of good quality. With it’s adjustable seat, we should get a good deal of use out of it. We got ours for $37 as an open box, definitely worth checking out what they have available under the “new & used” section! Would recommend to others and plan on purchasing as a gift for friends that have kiddos of a similar age.

DOMINICK DENNIS,5.0,2022 24 January,"
I bought this item in a “like new” condition trusting it would be in perfect condition as advertised from the Amazon warehouse and upon opening it I couldn’t even tell it wasn’t brand new!!! It’s super easy to assemble easy for baby to use and super cute!!
"
Nana,3.0,2022 31 January,"
The baby loved the bike but the wheels kept falling off. Dad tried fixing it but every time, they would fall off again. Finally got tired of it and returned it.

"
Darnell Whitecotton,5.0,2021 25 September,"
I found this exact bike in every way, but with 3 different name brands and 3 different prices. They where all manufactured in China. this one was the second best price but it had the best shipping. My year and a half baby is already starting to push herself around on it.
"
Danilo C.,3.0,2021 4 January,"
I’ve bought this bicycle for my son, but I had to return as it was too small for him, on the description and on the box it says it is recommended for children between 1 and 3 years old and my son is 15 months so we thought would be perfect for him. This bicycle is too small for him, if it wasn’t that I would have kept, has good quality.
"
PrettyPicky,5.0,2021 25 July,"
Wish these would have been around for my children. Can remember them always catching their little ankles on the back wheels, when they'd push themselves around. Overall better than expected. Easy to put together, durable material and stable. The grandbaby will get plenty of miles on it in no time lol
"
Laul,1.0,2021 1 June,"
Be careful! This isn't made well as part of the wheel came apart and i didn't know until I found my child with a screw in her mouth! The screw cap and screw came out of the wheel which is super dangerous! Please be very cautious if you have this bike! Not worth the worry in my opinion. It's worth spending more on a properly made bike than one that endangers a child's life.
"
jaymes loney,2.0,2020 23 October,"
I strongly dislike this product. The back wheel isn’t very sturdy so it constantly tips over. It’s not safe for the age group it’s marketed for. It’s super cute but not practical.

maria,5.0,2020 20 October,"
this was a gift to my granddaughter who turned one year old on Friday.  same day, the bike was delivered.  she is so in love with it.  wouldn't let her Dad touch the bike at all! however, she still has to tiptoe when pushing the bike as it is still a little big for her.
"
Anthony  Hug,5.0,2021 11 January,"
Grandson 1.5 years old loves it. Was slow and careful for a few days but quickly learning to balance. I can see him graduating to a full balance bike in a few months.

"

We assembled this bike as per the instructions but the parts barely fit together and as a result the bike can barely steer. It's very hard to turn the handlebars. Our toddler cannot turn them to steer.  Would not recommend this product.

"
Natalia D'Angelo,5.0,2022 25 October,"
This ninja blender is great. Very easy to assemble and disassemble. it is safe if you have kids that like to help in the kitchen because it only turns it own if every piece is in place and the lid is locked, so you can press the buttons but nothing will happen unless it is locked. It has 3 speeds, but number 1 of good enough to blend frozen things. I love it!
"
Wyatt Agnew,5.0,2022 5 November,"
Struggled through our old blender for years because it “still worked” and we got it for free when we got married. I wish we would have upgraded years ago! Love everything about it
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2022 21 September,"
We upgraded from an old basic Oster to this model. The Oster seemed to be dying.Overall it’s nice, it just doesn’t always blend all larger chunks, especially frozen fruit. Maybe there’s a trick to how to load it, or to phase load the blender for smoothies. I’ve heard great things about Ninja products, and we also just bought an air fryer. This one has been a little disappointing.My other least favorite thing is it’s trickier to clean. There are many crevices things seem to rest and get stuck. So that’s slightly annoying.I love the capacity for a family of four. I love the lid design. I love how the blade comes out, and the bottom doesn’t have to come off. That way it’s always aligned and it locks easily on to the motor base.It’s nice, but could use some design improvements I guess.
"
Madeline Vega,5.0,2022 1 November,"

I was skeptical about this blender after reading mixed reviews but I’m glad I ordered it. It’s really strong, blends nicely, cleans super easy and it makes my life easier.

Dustin H.,5.0,2022 7 October,"
You get what you pay for and you will.not find a better blender at this price point. This blender is just as good as my $300 VitamiX!! Do yourself a favor, don't buy cheap Walmart blenders. Get yourself a Ninja, you'll be glad you did!

Amanda Bailey,5.0,2022 3 October,"

"
Herbert Otto Homolka,5.0,2022 25 October,"

"
Alexis Reel,5.0,2022 16 September,"
I love this blender! I’ve made smoothies, sauces, and cocktails in it. It blends really well, and sometimes my smoothies come out to airy, but it still tastes good. The blade comes out easily to clean, but cleaning the blade entirely can be a little difficult and somewhat hard since the blade is really really sharp. The only drawback. I would highly recommend!!
"
Kari Crump,5.0,2022 25 September,"
Blends very well.  I was looking for a blender that worked well without having to put in a lot of liquid.  This blender works well with limited liquid and doesn't leave chunks.
"
Sue Brown,5.0,2022 6 September,"
So happy with this blender! I can’t believe we waited so long to buy a blender; we’re now using this almost daily. The blender is super easy to use and very powerful. My only complaint is that it can be hard to clean down in the crevices of the blade and base if you don’t clean it out right away. But that’s my own fault! Would definitely recommend!
"
T.K.,4.0,2022 5 October,"
Great power, good for smoothies, but too big for small tasks like a cup of hollandaise.
"
Gurbie,5.0,2022 1 October,"
We use this blender primarily for smoothies and it does an awesome job of blending frozen fruits!!!
"
M&M,5.0,2022 7 September,"
I went through THREE blenders before going with Ninja!  Has lasted for longer than three months and the ease of use and cleaning is a plus!  The only issue is I wish this model came with personal blender capability but otherwise would definitely recommend this blender.
"
kmk,5.0,2022 24 July,"
Pros:Easy to use—only three parts, guidelines on base help you see how to put the container on. Three easy buttons. Does not require tamping the food into the blade.Base is sleek and solid.Blades are VERY sharp. Be careful.Easy to clean. The blade comes out and rinses clean. The container is wide enough to reach into with a cloth. Beats the pricier Vitamix by a mile on cleaning ease.POWER— it ate up chunks of frozen fruit with no problems.Price—great price for the functionality.ConsIt’s large. Requires a lot of room on counter or in cabinet. Does not fit under kitchen top cabinets.Blades are dangerously sharp.It blends a lot of air into smoothies. They end up a bit foamy. I haven’t had it long, so there may be ways to avoid this.If you need a blender primarily for smoothies or frozen cocktails, you can’t go wrong here!
"
Kagrange,5.0,2022 26 September,"

"Catina Ryan,",5.0,2022 5 September,"
After my Breville died I needed another blender, but didn’t want to spend a lot as I’m saving for a Blendtec or vitamix. This is surprisingly good. It gets used at least twice a day for smoothies and does a great job. It handles ice and frozen berries like a champ.

"
Bea,5.0,2022 22 August,"
I had an old Ninja and this is a huge step up. A great machine and so much more powerful. It is much easier to clean than the old one because for some reason there was an opening at the bottom of the old one that allowed whatever was being blended to get into a little opening in the base and it was very hard to clean. I highly recommend this one!
"
Fat Boy,5.0,2022 15 August,"
This is the best blender I've ever had.  We use it mostly for fruit smoothies and it blends very well.  But one time I accidentally left a spoon in the blender, put the top in and started to blend.  I had added ice so figured the loud sound was the ice.  Instead, the spoon I had overlooked quickly blew a hole in the side of the container, and could have caused serious injuries had someone shorter than my 5'4"" been the user.  We got a replacement container and have been happily blending ever since.

david kwok,4.0,2022 30 July,"
As a person that worked at a smoothie shop I could tell you that the smoothies that I have made with this blender, have the same results as the vitamin x blender that I used to work with. if you use all frozen fruits it will take a little more to blend but when using a combination of fresh and frozen is very quick and easy!My only complain is that it’s a little bit hard to wash but everything else is fine!

I’ve purchased much more expensive blender and this is far superior as far as power, ease of use and easy to pop into the dishwasher. I use my blender a lot for hummus that is thick and hard on a blender, this does it with ease. Glad I believed the reviews I read on Amazon
"
Kaitlyn W,4.0,2022 8 August,"
We already have a Ninja blender and bought this for a vacation home. It is a more basic model than the blender we have at home. Wish all the models had more functions. With that said, it does the job and they are more powerful than other blenders we've used. Ninja is definitely my favorite for the power.

 The container measurement is off as to it being 72oz, I received a 64oz, just a bit deceiving. But, besides the container measurement difference, it's a pretty good blender. It did give a funny slite burning smell the first time I used it. It gets the job done
"
Erin B Gibb,5.0,2022 6 September,"
The ability to make crushed ice drinks, that are blended to perfection, with the right amount of juice and alcohol, was perfect.
"
S.C.,4.0,2022 18 May,"
So far, I’ve only used this once. I’ve turned it on to clean it a couple of times, though. It did a good job of blending everything. All the frozen strawberries were blended. Almost all of the frozen bananas were as well. It left one tiny piece of banana, but to be fair, my nutribullet does the same thing sometimes. I’ll post an update if I have any other issues with it in the near future. The only complaint I have today is the fact that it does not come with the same cup in the picture. It says 72oz, but it’s really 64oz. It’s not the worst thing ever, but it’s deceiving.  If you look through the pictures, there’s an * with an explanation of it only being able to hold 64oz. Mine doesn’t even say 72oz on the cup. It says 64oz.
"
Lana,5.0,2022 19 September,"
Love it. Blends wonderfully
"
Chelsey,4.0,2022 18 July,"
I love this blender, EXCEPT that it won’t blend chia seeds into my smoothie. They just get spun around and stay whole. It crushes ice, blends veggies and fruits, but just not the chia seeds. Maybe I’m using it wrong? My old Oster blender would pulverize the chia seeds, but it lacked the power to crush ice and frozen fruits well, so this turned out to be the complete opposite of my old one!
"
Ernie,5.0,2022 26 August,"
Get this blender, easy to clean, does what it’s suppose to do. Basically upgrade from a blender that’s been in the family for over 2 decades.
"
Kathey Fatica,5.0,2022 23 July,"
I have had the same Ninja 1000W model for probably 12 years and it's a work horse. But it’s old and I have to hold the lid down in one corner to get the motor to engage. It was time to replace it. I looked at replacing it with models with more bells and whistles and figured why pay extra for features that I already have on my food processor which works just fine. So I gladly chose the same Ninja model I've used for many years... and hope it lasts another 12!

Haven't used this blender all that often yet, but everything I've made in it has come out great.  I've made fruit smoothies, milk drinks, and potato pancakes so far.  I'm sure I'll be using it for more things because it is easier to clean than my food processor.

"
Juan Diaz de Lindo,5.0,2022 18 July,"
Ninja is a well known brand and it seems for good reason. This is one of their entry level models and despite this and it's low price, it is more than capable of doing what most folks require of it.There's a lemonade I make that requires I blend the entire lemon with rind and all and this thing sliced and diced half a dozen of them easily. Same thing with the ice added later.Just be careful when cleaning as those blades are SHARP. I speak from lacerated experience.
"
Sandra,5.0,2022 21 July,"
I wanted a blender so I could make smoothies. I ordered this Ninja blender during Prime Days. I love its power. The center blades are not just on bottom but also at middle and top so blending is complete. Lid locks on so no chance of it popping off, and there’s a corner of the lid that has an opening topour contents without removing lid. On scale of 1 - 10, this blender is a definite 10.

"
Soy La,4.0,2022 1 April,"
The blender works great so far but the first few uses it let off a smoky smell as if it was being overused and about to go out. I’m not sure why since I use more than enough liquid and I’ve only used fruits such as banana, mangoes and strawberries. I’m wondering how long this will actually work before it clocks out due to this . But as I said so far it’s blended with great power , so I have hope . Also the last two times, I didn’t notice the smell so maybe it was just a “breaking it in “ smell.Oh and I also didn’t like the fact that the blade doesn’t snap in. It just sits in there , which is fine overall, it was just off putting at first.
"
Dave Staats,5.0,2022 18 July,"
Wow! That already had an Osterizer Classic top of the line blender but it wasn't handy for making big or double smoothies. This thing with the ""blade tree"" is fantastic. The canister goes on and off easily ad does the lid. It only costs as much as 10 smoothies. 8 oz frozen fruit and 8 oz OJ makes a great smoothie in less than a minute. Great machine! I also love their cookware.

I just got this item yesterday looks pretty new but little skeptical. I saw a small round glue like thing and touched it got smudged and was oily as seen on pic. Ninja tag was off.  Looks like it has been repaired. Not sure. Hopefully its not a refurbished product. Haven’t used it yet. Got this item earlier than needed. Will definitely be reviewing it later again.

Just be aware that the blades on this thing are not like typical blender blades. They are tiny samurai swords and they will cut you to ribbons if you are not careful. Treat the ninja with respect.

I use this product usually to make my morning smoothies. I wasn't expecting it to have the power it did. The way it obliterated my fruits and vegetables was quite impressive. Great power in this blender, worth a buy. And it's power can be moderate too, if that's what you like.
"
Brenda Harmon,5.0,2022 16 July,"

I totally love this Ninja blender.  After years of having a very expensive smoothie/blender that finally died I needed another smoothie/blender.  Although my other one had a pour spot, this one does not.  But that's OK, I love this ninja.  I made strawberry smoothie in it and another day pineapple smoothie.  Used ice, etc.  Was fantastic.  Very fast n efficient.  Love, love,  love  this blender.

Trini C,5.0,2022 8 July,"
I was previously using an old blender to make smoothies until it died. It was the traditional four blades on the bottom and was quite noisy. I tried my new Ninja and the six blades that rotate throughout the picture make mixing far less noisy and efficient. The only thing I would advise is to use caution when cleaning the blades.

Anakronism,3.0,2022 15 August,"
I bought this blender for multiple daily use before and after gastric bypass surgery. I really loved it at first despite it being loud. It completely pulverized ice and made the smoothest shakes. However after only one month of use the blades have tiny little dings in them and the texture of my protein shakes has become crunchy from small chunks of ice that no longer blend to a smooth consistency. It's a good little blender but if you're planning on using it daily for things with ice in it, I wouldn't recommend it.

Amylou,5.0,2022 24 May,"
It has a safety feature that prevents you from blending without the lid. The triple blades makes slushies and smoothies quick and easy.
"
JenDiggity,2.0,2022 25 August,"
It doesn’t blend things entirely smooth even when you blend then let it sit for like half an hour in between three blend sessions to try and make sure everything is getting soft and absorbing fluid. Like BREAD will not blend. Wet bread is too tough for it. The controls are lousy (why no timed blend???). The blades are annoying to clean and don’t try and pour anything out with the blades still in because it’ll fall right out. I needed this for my son’s puréed food and it is wholly inadequate. And somehow I ordered TWO then proceeded to get Covid and be so sick I missed the return window so now I have two TERRIBLE blenders. What a waste of money. I’d buy the Instant Pot Ace blender again if they didn’t stop making it because of constant bearing issues. At least it could blend smoothly! I shouldn’t have to pay $400 for a decent blender! You manufacturers need to step up your game.

I received this blender on 5/20/2022 and it wouldn't blend my smoothie today (5/23/2022) regardless of how much liquid I put in.  I turned it on after taking all the ingredients out of the carafe and the blades spun perfectly.  I put just a small amount back in and they would barely turn.  I put more in with some MORE liquid and the blades wouldn't move at all.I'm returning it and looking for a different blender because there is no way I'm wasting $70 on something that works like this.
"
ET,2.0,2022 20 July,"
The blades are very dangerous..they go up so high I cut myself badly during first use. The blender itself did not puree ice like I thought it would in my smoothie it left big pieces so I had to return it unfortunately it just did not have the blending power I needed.

Blender seems very good the two times I’ve used it. Somehow already chipped the plastic bottom pretty significantly though with cracks extending pretty far. Not that sturdy on the plastic so protection plan may actually be worth it.
"
MossRose,1.0,2022 13 October,"
I never was able to use this blender because one leg on the base is crooked and shorter than the rest, meaning the blender rocks quite a bit. I was afraid to turn it on with only 3 legs touching the countertop.  Imagine the destruction! I am returning this blender (Thank you, Amazon, for making this a simple process!) and looking for a non-Ninja blender, since Ninja's quality control is less than dependable.

It has great power and works awesome! Blenderizes like I've never seen before. Unfortunately after 2 uses the bottom of the blender container itself cracked so now it leaks. Really disappointed about this. Having spent almost $100 I expected better quality.
"
Anne,1.0,2022 23 August,"
I loved the single-serve Ninja I’ve had for years, and recently bought this one because I figured I could use it for smoothies as well as cooking. Nope. So far I’ve only tried smoothies, and they come out a disgusting, gritty, grainy texture. I’m used to the Ninja single-serve blenders that do a great job of mixing everything up. This one will not give you the same result—expect ingredients to stick to the sides since it’s a square shape.
"
Molly B,1.0,2022 30 October,"

"
Ulua.kayak,1.0,2022 30 July,"
After two uses, the plastic on the Jat turn really foggy. Looks like from mixing ice and frozen fruits. Yes, I add ebough liquids, but it turns like the pictures shown. I have to return it, because I don't want to eat plastic with my Smooties. Other than that, no complain for everything else. I wish it has a better plastic quality.
"
Michael Statchen,1.0,2022 11 October,"

yvonne medina,1.0,2022 17 July,"
The description on the website saids it’s a 72oz pitcher and I received a 64oz pitcher, I didn’t realize until I used it and had already threw the box away , I don’t want a refund I just want the correct pitcher but the only options on the website it’s to return item, otherwise the blender works great.
"
Montessahall,1.0,2022 14 August,"
The power is definitely there however, when blending for smoothness it misses the mark. The dates in my banana smoothies are left chunky rather than blended. The blades are sharp which requires care when cleaning to avoid cuts to hand or fingers. Horrible blender for anything you want blended smooth
"
Ashley Russell,1.0,2022 26 April,"
Do not buy this it’s horrible it makes noise and smoke to the very first time we used it. I tried to return it to Amazon but they would not take it because our return window had closed. We keep it in our second home so we didn’t have a chance to use it before a return window closed. This company does not stand behind its products!!!
"
Steven Knoll,1.0,2022 5 September,"
The plastic top is already broken after only about 4 times of using it. Would not buy again plus all the ingredients stick to the side and don’t get mixed in.

Two weeks after the return window had closed (so we’ve had it for only 6 weeks) it developed a long crack on the container which causes it to leak.

This Ninja NJ601AMZ Professional Blender is a large and powerful Blender.  It has a 1000 watt motor and a large capacity Pitcher.  The pitcher has a 64oz max liquid capacity.  The pitcher is plastic and is lightweight but feels pretty durable.  It blends really well, sometimes too well.  My son likes to makes smoothies and this blends them up quickly and really well too.  The blades can be removed to clean, but beware they are sharp, have to be careful when they are in the dishwasher.  This Ninja blender definitely packs a punch and blends really well.
"
paul,5.0,2022 11 August,"

Mad Max,4.0,2021 23 December,"
This is a great blender for the price. After testing several top brands here are my notes:Keep in mind this Ninja is only 1,000 watts. For most people and most applications that's more than adequate, I'm not sure why people are so fixated on wattage instead of the more important aspects of a good blender. But just be aware, the high end brands do offer more wattage. Vitamix ranges from1100-1400, Blendtec offers 1500 and 1800 options, and the larger Ninja is 1500.The most consistently highest rated blender in the world is the Vitamix. They are workhorses, last forever, and crush anything. The second highest rated blender is Blendtec, for the same reasons. And I agree, they are the best built with superior motors.However, I will say the Ninja beats them on versatility. Also keep in mind you can add the Ninja food processor attachment to this (it doesn't come with one, but our old one fits it just fine).Having said all of that, my personal favorite is the Dash Chef Series Deluxe 64 oz Blender. It does not have attachments like the Ninja, but I find it to be extremely versatile, 1400 watt motor, and the easiest to use with the most settings. It has presets for smoothies, chopping ice, soups, ice cream, nut butter, a self-cleaning option, and it will even charge your phone or tablet. It has a built-in tablet stand (for when you're cooking), and it was the quietest of all the blenders I tested.The sticker price on the Dash is $229, so more than twice as much as this basic Ninja. If I have just $100 to spend, I would get this Ninja (or wait for the Ninja blender/food processor to go on sale). If I had $200 to spend, I would save up and get the Dash.One final note - on modern blenders, the motor isn't usually the first thing to fail. The digital buttons and dials are usually the first thing to fail. That's another reason the Vitamix is so well rated, because the electronics are simpler, it uses old fashioned knobs that don't fail. Still, though, I prefer the Dash.
"
Julie,5.0,2022 7 June,"
This blender works as well as the Vitamix we own. It may mix a little better and faster even with the blade placement throughout. Personally, I prefer the blades at the bottom because I like to use a spatula to scrape out all of the smoothie, and there isn't room for a spatula between the blades and the sides of this mixer. But that's the only drawback I've found. Otherwise, this blender works great -- definitely upgrade from the typical blender.
"
Christie W.,4.0,2022 14 January,"
This blender is powerful. I can't say if it does the job better than my cheaper blender, though. It does seem a little quieter. And the pitcher holds 72 oz whereas my other blender holds 48oz. I'm not comfortable with using it with anything hot since it is a plastic pitcher... The blade only seems securely in place when the lid is on, when I poured out my drink the blade came too.
"
Yashahime,4.0,2022 5 January,"
I do gotta admit that the blades of this blender are razor sharp be careful and weary when you are cleaning and using this blender. At first sight this blender is pretty standard in size and really packs a punch.This blender has a standard open cap or a halfway open cap depending on how you want to use it. The blender has a twist and lock style so the actual blender does not shake off the machine. The machine is really powerful and is able to blend frozen fruits into a smoothly easily. It's also super easy to disassemble and also clean, you can put some detergent along with hot water and run the blender.If you are looking for something that packs a punch and works flawlessly this is a great option.
"
Jeffrey Van Wagoner,5.0,2022 10 February,"
We have had this blender for a couple of months and have made many smoothies, hummus, and puréed soup. Other reviewers have mentioned that the container has cracked, but so far, ours has held strong. I will update this review if that changes. I love that this blender is simple to use as there are only four buttons. It is a nice-looking blender and feels very sturdy. It came well packaged and in excellent condition. The smoothies are delicious and nice and smooth if you let it run for long enough- otherwise, there may be ice chunks. The square shape helps with the contents blending instead of just spinning like they sometimes do in a round blender. The lid is a little tricky, and my kids struggle with it when they are helping, as there is only one way you can put it on, and the handle has to be up and then locked down. It is nice that it locks. The pour spout is also good and is much less drippy than our last blender, so we don't end up with smoothies all over the table. My favorite feature about this blender is that it is easy to clean. There is no need to unscrew things - take the blade out, and you can easily hand wash the pitcher without slicing your fingers, or fill the whole thing with some soapy water, blend it on high, and rinse. The blade is a little scary to handle, as it is three blades that go all the way around. Overall we are pleased with this blender. I've always wanted a VitaMix, and although this blender is not quite as nice, it works great for us.

 Edit: I have been using this brander for close to a year now and I am really enjoying it now that I am used to it. I use it to blend my hot sauce and it does a pretty good job getting it really blended. If I quickly pulse it I can get it to coarsely chop my veggies too. I am really glad I have this blender.So far this blender works well for me. It is definitely a bit loud. As all blenders are.. It also seems a bit… much- the big lid that has to go on a certain way, the button you have to push to release it, the pour spout hole, the ginormous blades.. please note-apparently the blades are not attached and you need to remove them before pouring. I made a smoothie that ended up being thicker than I meant for, so I couldn’t pour it through that little pour hole. The blades came shooting out and just missed my hand. Thank goodness, because those blades are sharp I know they would have done damage.This blender has a large capacity which is nice when I need it. I find myself reaching for my old blender because it just seems smaller and less bulky.I was very excited for this blender. This blender does work good, it blends as a blender should, nothing special to me though. It still misses occasional chunks when blending, just like my old blender. This one is more work to clean though.

Very nice blender for the price. It is no vitamix, but it holds a lot and the jar isn't too heavy.  Works great and has a small countertop footprint.

My family LOVES Ninja kitchen appliances, so let's get that out of the way first. It definitely affects reviews because just seeing the name inspires trust in my family full of pretty decent cooks and they put them through their paces.This is a nice blender, it has done well with everything we've thrown into it. While I do have a combination Ninja food processor/blender, this is the blender we use for smoothies, etc. It handles nuts and other things like a dream.

This blender is fairly large (definitely full-sized, and not personal-sized), and it makes fast work of most things you might wish to blend. It doesn't have the same power as some of the most powerful blenders on the market, but it provides a good balance of blending power and economical price. If you start getting up to the 1500 watt power rating, you'll be spending at least $150 or more, depending on the brand you go for. With this, you get a great amount of power (1000 watts) from a very well-known brand, and it's just $100. Some of the benefits of this:1. The blending blades go up the middle of blender rather than just sitting at the bottom. You have extra blades, which means that it blends evenly top to bottom, without much chance of things getting stuck to the sides and not blending.2. It's large, but it looks pretty nice and professional, similar to what you might see in smoothie places.3. The power is enough to get through most anything. It crushes ice in smoothies, resulting in a very uniform result. It works to blend soups, sauces, purees, etc. I haven't found something it can't get through effectively and quickly.Overall, for the price, it's great. Unless you know you'll need to really blend some tough stuff, this should be enough for most home uses.

The best thing about these Ninja blenders is that the blades go all the way up the stem. These means they circulate the ingredients much better than a blender with just bottom blades and you spend less time scraping stuff back down to get it to blend.This one has enough power to really chop ice to the size you can use for drinks.You can only put 64 ounces in it, it needs room at the top.It is straightforward with just 3 buttons and a pulse button. That is really all you need. The fact that they are flat makes them easier to clean.I will say, look around. The prices on these Ninjas vary a lot, and you can get one with more power at the some price, with maybe a few less buttons. Some even come with the smoothie cups, which this one does not.  So think about what you want before buying and look at all the available models.I am taking a star because at the current 100 price this should come with some smoothie cups, a more powerful but older version of this comes with two and costs 10 bucks less.

This Ninja NJ601AMZ blender is powerful (1000 watts) and not too loud.  It's easy to use and also easy to clean; the pitcher is even dishwasher safe.  The only thing I don't like is that the pitcher is plastic.  I prefer the all-metal pitchers of vintage Vitamix blenders, but blenders these days don't seem to offer that.  It comes with a booklet of 10 recipes to get you started.

 I was intrigued and impresssed by this nice-appearing blender until I realized that the same basic blender is available in a higher-powered version with more features for $10 less than the price being charged for this model here on Amazon. You can find the better, less expensive, blender here: https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-BN701-Professional-capacity-Crushing/dp/B0855B5Z6F/.So I can see no real reason to recommend this blender at $99, despite the fact that it's a capable blender. But the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus Bender has 1400 watts of power to this blender's 1000 watts, and three programmed functions for making smoothies, frozen drinks and blending ice cream that this blender lacks. And it costs $89.If you get this blender, be careful of the blade. Like other Ninja blender blades, it's exceedingly sharp.Otherwise, this is a capable basic blender from Ninja.

Baazumi,5.0,2022 12 February,"
Powerful blender that handles ice really well and makes great smoothies.  It also purees vegetables and soups that come out nice and creamy.  The jar holds 72 ounce which is quite a lot and is easy to clean. A biton the noisy side as all blenders are these days.  Great price for what you get.

I love Stuff,5.0,2021 14 December,"
This is a really nice blender. Build quality is plastic, but quality plastic. Nothing feels flimsy or fragile. Everything works well from the buttons to the lid. That isn't what makes this blender stand out though. Its the blades. Every other blender with just one set of bottom blades makes crushing ice annoying. You have constant move the ice or add tons of liquid. Since these blades go all the way up the stem, ice or pretty much anything blends easily without stirring or with minimal stirring. Why don't other blenders do this? It is like every company out there releases the same blender over and over again. This style of blade is by far the best I have ever used. The price on this unit is also stellar for the wonderful blending this unit does. There is no other blender in the same price range that blends as well as this does.
"
Dusty Trails,5.0,2022 3 January,"
This blender is what to expect from a Ninja product. The pitcher is a nice size, and the blades are super sharp. I pureed some oranges quickly and effortlessly with this beast. Time will tell how it holds up. I will say I feel like the blender is too powerful for the materials it is built with, which may shorten its life, but way too early to tell. For now I have no complaints though and highly recommend for a powerful blender.
"
Lycanroc,5.0,2022 9 January,"
The blades are super sharp, which is great for the slicing. It worked really great for smoothies. I'm excited to try this out with other things.One thing I have to note is that there was a somewhat discernible smell when running the blender, but it was nothing too concerning. I'll update this review if anything happens to it.

 Pros:-The main thing I use a blender for is to make frozen cocktails. The ninja blender is the only one I have ever used that gives a thick consistency like you would get when going to a restaurant.-This can make snow out of ice cubes, I love using this for making certain cocktails like mint juleps.-Blender works great for all other needs. When making smoothies, it really liquifies most of the pulp, but there is still a very small trace of pulp that will be noticed when drinking.-Overall the blender is easy to use. Just keep in mind the blender has safety mechanisms so the lid must be on correctly, as well as the base, otherwise it won’t operate.Considerations:-The blade on this blender is very sharp. I am always nervous washing. However, as long as you are careful, it isn’t an issue.-This blender is a little taller than my past blenders and can’t fit below my cabinets on my counter.-This blender isn’t as strong as some of the other ninja blenders at only 1000 watts. My other blender is 1200 watts. However, I noticed that it still makes snow just as well.

Tom,5.0,2021 19 December,"
A nice sized, all purpose blender. Simple push button operation without the fancy program modes. The Ninja blenders do a great job with ice and are perfect for frozen drinks. Generous 72 ounce capacity, but you'll not want to fill it up that much unless you want a big mess on your hands. Easy to clean and dishwasher safe to boot.

Rk Star,5.0,2021 19 December,"
I have a much more expensive blender that I've had for years and decided to give this a try. I make green shake smoothies every morning for my family and I am blown away at the power of this machine. It crushes ice incredibly well and puree's everything into a nice smooth consistency. This is really important for me because my daughter can't have ANY chunks even the tiniest chunk in any of her smoothies and this pulverizes everything so well! What a great price for such a powerful blender. Love it
"
Christopher Wells,5.0,2021 14 December,"
Absolutely love this blender. I also have the 3pc blender with the motor that hops to each size,  but this is less pieces to keep track of. Love that the lid locks on as well!
"
B Wallis,3.0,2022 29 April,"
Ninja usually makes top-of-the-line stuff. And I am obsessed for a reason. So I thought this blender would be an excellent addition to my growing collection of Ninja kitchen goodies. Wrong.At first? The blender worked GREAT. Not too noisy. Nice balance of power for the price, and I do mean that! It's awesome for smoothies, gravies and soups, which is ALL I have used it for. One day I heard a little crack sound and there's a little crack forming at one corner of the jar. Not even any ice cubes or anything in there heavy.It hasn't full on cracked open but I am watching it closely. I don't like having to use an appliance wondering about another shoe potentially dropping in the form of a blender jar cracking open mid-cycle.Will it crack all the way? I don't know. I think it's the vibrations of the unit that cause that. I've never had a blender jar crack on me before, even the esteemed old blender my mother has been using for 30 years.I will update if it cracks all the way. In the meantime, I also noticed it's starting to have a hard time blending my spinach for smoothies. This makes me sad, I prefer to blend my greens for the added fiber benefit. Not sure I want chunks like this in my smoothies. I have to run it a little longer just to get it all, and increasingly finding bits in my smoothies.

Wade N,3.0,2022 10 February,"
I really liked the strength and the power of this Ninja NJ601 blender in blending and mixing a variety of food and ingredients. It does not produce a very annoying noise. The blades are very sharp and are very successful in crushing and mixing a wide range of compounds. The cleaning of the pitcher and the blades is easy and the pitcher has a fairly large size which makes it suitable for soup blending, making large amounts of frozen drinks and shakes.There are also some issues that I noticed with this model. Firstly, the pitcher material (BPA-free plastic) does not seem to be very durable and is not very resistant to some scratches that might happen during the ice crushing. I also noticed that there are some other models available from Ninja with more powerful motors (1400 or 1100 Watts) at the same price. For instance, Ninja BN701 and Ninja BL660  are equipped with stronger motors with exactly the same price (at the moment) and as I know, the motor power is directly related to the crushing and mixing power of the blender! Another issue that I noticed is the relatively weak front panel design. I see that on some other models, Ninja has done a much better job to give a variety of options to users to choose the type of mixture that they want. Here, we only see 3 power settings and this may not be so easy for some beginner users to choose the right power for their blending.Overall, the blender does a great job of doing the main functions of blending and crushing and the blades seem to be durable (based on the time that I've been using the blender!). However, I personally expected a better design and some more features from the Ninja and its current blender (Ninja NJ601AMZ).

Walker Henley,2.0,2022 23 May,"
I make a lot of smoothies, and my cheap $30 Oster did a better job than this thing. Square pitcher with circular blades = can't blend the little bits. I end up with bits of oats and flax in my not-so-smooth smoothie. Seems powerful and i like the little single-serve options, but overall i wouldn't recommend this product.

Daniel,1.0,2022 8 May,"

First Impression:Whoa... will this work it's Tiny!and it will because- It's a 1/2 HP DC motor which is equivalent to a 1 HP AC motor and powerful enough for it to pull my gate.- Gate Weight limit when I purchased was listed as 1400 lb currently it mentions 1100 lb, mine falls at or below 1400 lb or so.What is included and what is not:It includes mounting hardware, screws brackets, and mounting steel frame. A fair amount of chain. Some not-so-good tools. We got 2 key chain Remote openers in the boxWhat you may need to get:Safety Sensor: It did not include the safety sensor when I bought it so I bought that. Like your garage door if something is in the path it will stop closing and open back up. Do not, repeat Do Not power the gate up without this sensor, Period. Unless you want things getting crushed, you get the idea.Safety sensor wiring and technical writing in the manual did not make sense I ended up calling the tech support line of the safety sensor and got the correct instruction on wiring.Chain:I also had to get some extra chains, my gate's length is a little less than 34~36 feet.Chain mending tool: Get one to make it easier for yourself.Mounting Bolts that go in the concrete Block:Take the Mounting Bracket with you and get these 4 Concrete Anchor Bolts from box stores in the hardware section.Yes, please use Re-Bars in that concrete block. You'll notice my assembly is a little bit different where it's higher than usual assembly since I've a retaining wall in that area that became my mounting block instead.**Important Note:Before pouring concrete tie those anchor bolts and do this step that will save some elbow grease later. While pouring the concrete use the mounting bracket with those bolts so that those bolts don't move away and later on don't line up with the mounting brackets.I did not do this and later on, I had to spend a good amount of time to get the steel mounting bracket on those bolts. Now that I think of it could I've eliminated that steel mounting bracket, I wonder. So if anyone has done it without that please post your comment.Keypad Opener:We bought 2 one inside the gate and another one outside the gate. Also, we got extra keychain opener to put one in each car. Remember to program all of these with the opener’s circuit board, you’ll find the instruction in the manual.Power to the mounting Block, wire, conduit, and breaker:I ran metal conduit/pipe to the mounting area into the ground and used direct bury cable in the ground then up again in the metal pipe into my garage wall then attic, and down into the breaker box with a dedicated 15 Amp breaker. I installed a box at the mounting area to include a GFCI outlet for later. If you’re not savvy with this type of work please hire an electrician for this work.Tools: If you have a rachet set and screwdrivers that will do with what’s supplied in the box.Installation:Mounting the motor assembly was okay. Then we actually welded the end brackets that will hold the chain. I think that would be sturdier than mounting that with bolts. When came time to install the magnet sensors that’s where we spent a lot of time figuring out the height and how close it needs to be to the motor. You will need another person for sure with this part.Maintenance:Check the nuts and bolts say each quarter. I installed this in January 2020 and this Labor Day (2022) the Magnet signal receiving block or the function in the motor unit stopped working. While checking on that I found out 2 nuts totally came off and some needed tightening.Since the magnet stop function was not working my gate got derailed. I put it back and while trying to figure out what was wrong it derailed again. Let’s just say it’s a bit of work to put it back on the rail.So here is another important tip I’ll add as a note below.Important Note:While building the rail for the gate, add 2 to 3 feet of extra at the opening side. In case the motor malfunctions and goes out more than it’s supposed to it won’t get derailed and the chain will stop it. If you have it to the mark and if it goes that extra foot and a half it will surely derail. So please put the extra couple of feet of rail to save agony later on.After Sale Service: In my humble opinion, this is what matters for a good product and the company stands behind it.Customer/Technical Support:February 2020:During installation, a simple electrical connector went bad and I was made to get a replacement unit then customer service finally responded and sent me that connector, and I sent the new-new unit back.September 2022:This time it is out of its 1 year warranty period and the magnet unit is not responding where the gate does not stop. I’ve sent an E-mail via Amazon and no response; I just sent another E-mail directly to its support E-mail and waiting to see what kind of support or direction I get.

J. Fox,4.0,2021 19 June,"
This unit has great ratings so I'll just skip all the perks and say yes, for the money it seems to be a good deal. In fact, I'm not sure you can beat it. In fact, the cost for what you get is why I'll still give it 4 stars despite the fact that trying to make it work right is only slightly more challenging than defusing a bomb, in the dark, with nail clippers, while passing a kidney stone.The sad thing is that it's not the unit so much as the ridiculously deplorable excuse for instructions.  Now don't get me wrong.  I'm fine with crappy instructions that just don't explain things.  I'm very good with tools, relays, circuitry, and engineering.  The issue here is that the instructions aren't just bad, they're WRONG.  They send you down bad roads.  If they were written correctly, this would be a 5-Star machine.If you look around you will find many people have complained about this, and offered different workarounds.  I'll do my best to lay out what I did in hopes of helping someone else.First, there are several Youtube videos out there.  The Heritage Farms channel has a few videos on this.  Their original review and video on installing the Seco-Larm Enforcer electric eye are ones I would highly recommend.  The Enforcer electric eye I mention as many reviewers seem to use that, but holy cow, that's another one with instructions that are as wrong as these.My unit is a Right Hand installation as depicted in the instructions.  What I mean is that if you're inside the fence, looking at the gate, my opener is on the right hand side of the driveway, just like the one in the Heritage Farms video.  In this configuration, you are supposed to set the board to ""FWD.""  If it was on the other side, you would set the board to ""REV.""Once it was all installed and working, I hooked up the Enforcer electric eye, and what would happen is that if the beam was broken while the gate was closing, it was ignored, and if the beam was broken when the gate was opening, it reversed and started closing.  So exactly the opposite of what it's supposed to do.  By the same token, if you set the gate to auto close after so many seconds, what would happen is that when it opened, it would stay there all day, but if you closed it, then it would open after that many seconds.  So clearly, the gate thought it was open when closed, and closed when open.  At this point simply changing the switch from FWD to REV will not fix the issue.I believe in the Heritage Farms video he had the same problem, as he said he believed they had wired a circuit backwards in the system, and I concur.  I rewired it.  He fixed his by reversing the way the chain feeds through the sprockets, and I think he may have had to change his magnets.  I didn't do that for two reasons.  The first is that someone here posted a question as to how the chain was supposed to feed, and Banyan Imports stated that it is indeed supposed to feed like in the manual.  To be fair, based on my one communication with them, I'm not sure they have the slightest idea what's correct, but the other reason I didn't change it was because when I started to do it I realized I was going to have to re-cut the chain as it changed the length needed.So here is how I fixed mine.  I can't say if it will work for anyone else, or if what I did is the right thing to do.  It's just how I fixed mine to work like it says it's supposed to work in the manual.  No warranties express or implied, your mileage may vary, and all that fun stuff:First, I found that backwardly wired circuit which if you look at your schematic is at the X7 terminals.  The schematic shows wires marked OPLM and CLLM.  I frogged those two wires on the block (reversed their position).  Doing this kept me from having to change the positioning of the two magnets that were already mounted to the gate.  I was done welding, painting, etc., and just didn't want to have to move them.  Then I changed the switch configuration on the board from FWD to REV (which is dead WRONG per the directions).  Then, viola.  It works fine.Now for that Seco-Larm Enforcer beam.  I'll post this in my review there, but if you use one of these things it's not straight forward either.  I usually like Seco-Larm products, but this is a terrible schematic.  The CO-Z clearly uses DC current to power the beam, and you can confirm this with a Fluke meter, but you have to use the AC wire.  Here is the configuration to make it work on the CO-Z (or at least what worked for me):Power Slot = Brown WireGnd Slot = Both Blue & White WireIR Slot = Grey WireBlack Wire is UnusedI would still recommend the unit, but I would have been better off had there been no directions at all.One suggestion.  When you're setting it up and testing before you mount anything, turn on auto-close.  Then you can see what the unit thinks is opened, closed, etc. as you play with the magnets.  That could keep you from dealing with some of these headaches.Good luck.

Not a compensated comment. Overall you can't beat the quality of this product so far, it is hard to say how long the motor will last, but hopefully you can get replacement parts and that would be a plus! Very clean installation and with some modifications it has met my expectations. First of all it comes with basically everything you will need to get it going. The anchors would be a nice addition, I used 3/8 in and is very solid, make sure you start with a good foundation. On my install I timed it with the concrete pour for the gate so is one big slab of concrete and it is solid. My electrical box is on the opposite side of the driveway so I used the gate track and ran the thermostat cable under it, perfect for my needs. The gate was built at exactly 20 ft so no chain modification was required. Since the gate has a lot of metal at the bottom I had to extend the antenna, now it goes all the way up the pole and I can operate the gate at a much farther distance. Looking into adding WIFI module any recommendations would be appreciated. The bolts were a little too long for my gate and should be design with security in mind, maybe allen type or tork head,  but nothing a cutting disk can't manage and in my case they are not exposed to the outside where they can be tampered with. The chain tension brackets could use an up and down side to side adjustment sort of like a cross type to be able to offer better adjustment capability to the chain. In my case they worked out just fine. The L bracket could be shorter where the chain bolts down to, just in case the gate pole is too close and hits it, in my case it was perfect and barely miss the poles. The instructions could be better, seems like this is a big issue with some owners. The remotes. I don't like to be looking for a remote while I'm driving to open a gate. I went ahead an installed a visor clip, most will do just make sure the screws you use are not too long that can damage the electronics inside the remote. The wireless keypad works great and should be part of the opener's package, maybe a compatible sensor also. I tried installing a sensor but had no luck, (wired according to 2 videos I watched on U2B) but instead of retracting or stopping the gate when the beam was broken (could hear the relay and the light change from yellow to red) the gate just kept going so I removed it and return it, I will try  again since I believe the problem was with the sensor. I would recommend this product at this time. I'm hoping to get many years of trouble free performance, only time will tell. Last but not least, don't forget to lube the chain every so often. Update July 14, 2021,  since there is a sidewalk by the gate I installed a strobe light, comes on and off when the gate closes or opens, great visual indications the gate is moving. Will try a WIFI smart switch shortly to see if I can voice open and close. Just need to find a compatible remote for the WIFI switch to simulate the button press to open and close and install a wired magnetic sensor for status checks, or figure out which terminals to hook up the switch to the board if possible, but there is not much information out there for this and the schematic in the manual that came with the opener is not for the model I actually got. Basically the same thing I did for the garage opener and it works like a charm. I like the idea of Alexa opening or closing the gate as I depart or arrive to the house. This would complete this project! UPDATE, 16th July 2021, finally got the voice open/close going, works like a charm with status command. I have to say I'm impressed with this opener. I can open the Alexa app coming back to the house and open the front gate using voice commands with security passcode, the gate is 20 ft long so it takes a while for it to open, I wish the opener had 2 speeds a slow/fast but it doesn't so this way I can have it open by the time I arrive at the house and don't have to stop traffic waiting on it to open. I can also open the garage door the same way. UPDATE: October 2021, Customer support has been excellent! The seller got your back!

So there is a lot of unmentioned tools needed for this job that should make it less of a hassle so far that I know of… starting off you need a power supply cord and people just recommend cutting one end of an extension cord you already own you need a chain breaking tool so it’s wait to get the right length you’ll also need needle nose pliers a very good drill extra materials to make your fence longer if needed I had to weld 2 longer bars as machine needs to be 11 inches away from end of the gate you also need zip ties for the magnets and luck figuring out the instructions… most people have have bought there own base bolts because the kit comes with weird L shaped ones I will be using what it came with and post pics after words

Michelle Smith,5.0,2022 16 October,"
It was perfect. Just what we were looking for. No more getting out of the car rain, snow, sleet or shine to open the gate. We even made our own gate that my husband installed and we are fixed. I would recommend this product. Thanks COZ

RR,5.0,2022 1 August,"
We had a new fence installed and wanted a sliding gate across our carport. Had the fence company install the new fence and the built the gate. The rest was up to myself or a operator installer. The installer quoted me over $4,000.00. I added a post with guide rollers. Ran electric to the site. and the rest was pretty simple. The magnets were a bit difficult to locate in the exact spot, but otherwise all is good. Operates as it should.I only wish CO-Z made a remote on a visor clip. Having to dig around for a key chain every time is a non starter and I see no other option they sell. I bought a couple of generic visor clips and drilled holes through the back of the keychain remotes so we could have them on the visor. This worked for us.The remotes have 4 buttons. The buttons do not have any other function other than ""Operate"" You have to program each of the 4 buttons and they all do exactly the same thing. I suppose this is great for those of us who have to operate more than 1 gate. But I see no real world reason to have more than 1 button.Still a good buy and would buy again.

David,5.0,2021 11 January,"
I've had a side-yard access gate at my house for approximately 7 years.  This is my 3rd gate opener and it should have been my first.  I went through two different iterations of rack-and-pinion, low-voltage gate openers from Gate Crafters at the cost of $600 each, and neither one ever worked right.  The first one had horrible range and would over-run the limit if it got misaligned.  The second one wasn't much better, but the range was approved.  The problem with those systems is that it would count revolutions of the motor and count them back down when closing - if the rack skips on the pinion at all while opening, it will try to close past the stop point, and the motor wasn't smart enough to stop - it eventually would have burned up.  So the gate always needed to be supervised.  What's the point then?  Might as well manually open it.Sure, I had to wire 110v for this one, but its worth it!  The chain drive is far superior to rack and pinion as it is much less susceptible [impossible?] to skipping.  I had to adjust the rack every season to account for temperature changes - that problem appears to go away with this one.  This motor is powerful - much more so than the low-voltage one previously; if the rack and pinion were too tight it would just stop moving the gate (extremely frustrating).  Again, what's the point of a gate opener then?Installation?  I'm a pretty experienced DIYer and figured this out in spite of the quite unclear instructions.  Now that I have it installed I see there are many YouTube videos to assist.  Just make sure you have something to shorten a chain - I ended up having to cut it off and clean up the end link with a Dremel.  Use 1/2"" concrete anchors and shim to level if you need to.Oddly, I set the reverse switch as it suggested, but that was unnecessary.  I haven't setup auto-close on it, nor the IR sensor (on order) - so I'll have to work through that if my open/close is backwards.  Instructions sure could have been clearer on this.Installation time?  A couple trips to the hardware store (electrical and concrete anchors).  About 2 hours to get the 100v run to it.  About 2 hours to test the motor to see how it works with the limit magnets and determine exactly where the motor will be placed as well as the limit magnets (I highly recommend taking your time here to make sure you fully understand before you mount it).  About another 3 hours to get it fully mounted, chain installed and tested.  Finally, I spent 2 hours playing with it in amazement that it it actually worked correctly unlike the much more expensive previous models.Wow, 5-stars because of price, performance and quality.  1-star for instructions.

Scootr,4.0,2020 25 February,"
We electrified our existing gate.We did a fair amount of research and decided on the C)-Z opener for the following reasons.1. Price2. was amazon support and warranty3. The reviews were pretty good4. Auto close feature sounds good... hope I can find out how to activate this5. It works with a infrared safety switch ( extra) so it on't close on your car, your dog, etc6. It can work with a key pad for delivery or emergency service entrance7. speaking of emergency there is a simple keyed manual operation for times when the power is out or whatever.8. It can operate a courtesy light.9. It said it would operate a 1400 pound gate 40 ft long.Honestly who has a gate like that? Fort Knox ?We have an 350 pound gate rolling across our asphalt drive with a two wheel trolley out front and 3 rollers on 3 pipes bolted to the fence. Pretty standard. We changed the front wheels from 6 to 8"". One wheel is a hard acrylic  and other is steel wheel with a V groove. Matching V groved track was secured to the drive. This guides the gate.Make sure your gate rolls straight and easy. Fix any imbalance or tracking issues before installing the opener.We poured 16x18x18 pier to support the opener. We ran house current out to the pier and embedded the J bolts afixed to the support stand into the we cement. Installation was pretty easy to follow except we lost a page of instruction for awhile - we had the open and closed magnet positions reversed. FYI the high position magnet is the open limit and the lower position one is the close limit. To learn the magnet position disengage the drive chain gear. move the gate to the desired open or closed position and pass the magnet behind the running opener until it stops. Do this repeatedly until you know where the magnet needs to to be mounted.Be sure to start with a magnet position so the gate will stop a little short and then sneak up on the final adjustment. If you do screw up unbolt the chain to release. At this time we realized having a power off switch is very helpful as the gate will NOT STOP TRYING TO CLOSE if it hits something. always keep the remote in hand when first testing in case you need to stop. Begin testing with the gate in the middle position for safety.Now 9 months later. We love our automated gate. We operate it 6 - 12 times a day. Likely you will have to do maintenance or make adjustments from time to time.  Our gate wheels and track require maintenance. and we do spray grease  on the chain and moving parts. Today I had to move a magnet closer to the control box so the control would detect the magnet reliably. Not sure why that changed but I also stuck an additional little rare earth magnet on the original magnet to boost it's strength. So be prepared to maintain the operation.That's it - we love it after pulling this gate shut for 20 years... The remote works from 3-400 ft away. I bought more remotes so we can have them in all the cars, golf carts, and tractors.Do it - you will be glad you did. Oh yeah the DC feature requires 24v - that might work some of you.

I was iffy on purchasing this gate opener, there are way more expensive brands and I did not have faith in this. BUUUUUUUT let me tell you people, this thing rocks. I installed it 2 yrs ago and it's still kicking.If you have a some electrical knowledge and a hint of welding (welding not required) skills you can make this work.Took me about 5 hrs to install and have running. You will need to pour a concrete pad 18 inches square and deep (ideally you want 400 lbs, 4 95 lbs bags of quickrete). There are plenty of videos on YouTube as to how to install. I had to install a bar at the end of my gate, I would loose allot if my driveway if I didn't. All in all I recommend this gate opener.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 17 April,"
Great little gate opener. After looking for many electric gate opener, we decided to give this one a try considering the price.Installation was fairly easy, except  two things 1) Setting up the magnetic sensor2) Trying to Hook up the wire into the unit (It's a tight spot so had to be careful. Wish there was more space).Chain link rolling gate:400lb (24 feet wide and 6 feet high).Wire used:12/3 outdoor wireChain:The chain that comes with the package is 20 feet( two chains of 10 feet each).  Bought an additional #41 chainPower consumption:To test how much power the motor draws, connected the power source to a 20 amp smart plug and 20 amp GFCI outlet.Here's the reading's ( Not sure these readings are accurate though). Watts:228, mA 1898, Ac voltage 122.3.Overall cost was approx $500🙂 to setup and get the gate working. It's only been a month so time will only tell how durable the product is.

Eva Garcia,5.0,2020 7 July,"
This machine is powerful and works great. I had to pay someone to install because I am not that handy. If you are handy, then you will save money on installation. It is powerful, see videos relating to this product that is exactly what you are going to get. It is expensive to pay someone to install in Dallas. Most people were charging around $300, and I think that was on the cheap side with handy mean and not a company. I found a neighbors friend that only charged me $100. I still have to get an electrician out to drive an electric cable under the ground, for now I've been using an extension cord. This will probably cost me around $50. You have to take these cost into account when purchasing the product. You have to be careful with this machine it is powerful, reviews talk about car damage, etc. I'm just very careful with the device. I purchased an extra beam (Seco-Larm E-931) to have the machine retract when something gets in its way. But, the installer advised against it because they fog up and stop working, and then I'll have to call him for repair. This is exactly what the negative reviews state about safety beam, so I returned it. Installer mentioned good beams start at $200 so I opted on skipping that part and I have very careful with the machine. I have not had any problems yet and installed the machine about 2-3 months ago. I purchased this product due to the positive reviews. There are some negative reviews but I have not had any issues. The only thing to take into account is who is going to install the machine and the cost that come with it. On on another note, the control has four buttons for different options. We also opted on just using one button to open and close, we don't have all those other special features like opening the door for just a person versus all the way for a car. So only one button functions on our control. The reason we did this was because my dad wouldn't be able to figure out all the options on the control, so we went for a simple approach and nothing fancy. You can hit the button earlier on so you can stop the gate at whatever point you desire.

O.D.,5.0,2022 6 May,"
I stumbled on this item during black Friday and for the price tag I knew it was too good to pass up. I had never installed a motor for a gate before but I imagined it would not be too difficult. Upon reading the owners manual it did not require many steps and it came with most of the items I would need for the install. I was not able to make use of the square or round brackets it came with as I have a wood fence with the metal framing being much thicker than the brackets so I did have to find another solution. All in all it was a great purchase especially considering the fact that I was quoted $2000-5000 by various contractors to have a very similar motor to this one installed.
"
D. 🐢,4.0,2021 24 August,"
Pretty good gate opener for the price. Hard part was lining everything up (position of bolts on cement, how close the motor has to be to the gate to ensure the chain runs through the gears, can't forget the magnets have to be pretty close to the motor to stop, then the height of the chain, then making sure it stops in the correct postion)  and cutting the chain for the right length. I used a grinder because that's what I had. Easy to put a sensor by looking at youtube. Added a solar panel kit, inverter, and battery because we didn't want to run electricity 170 feet. Took me a weekend to install mostly due to having to let the cement dry. Only complaint is that the key was difficult to insert and remove after a few weeks and now it's stuck in the key hole. And I can't remove it. And I'm afraid if I do remove it, it won't go back in when we need it. But I can still turn the key to open the gate manually if needed. But now anyone can jump the gate and open it with the stuck key.  Cost for whole install was about $500 compared to the lowest quote we got of $1000. Now we don't get attacked by mosquitoes when opening the gate. 😀 Maybe it would have been easier to pour the cement and drill holes to use the bolts that expand instead of setting the bolts provided in wet cement hoping everything lined up. But I'm no expert installer. 🙃

 I was not sure if this gate would be as strong or capable as I wanted it to be, especially for the price, but I’m so happy I took the gamble on it.It is plenty strong enough for my 27ft x 8ft tall sliding driveway gate.  I don’t have the pickets on yet (they are out of stock due to COVID), but I am not concerned at all about it being able to handle the extra weight when I do.  And my driveway has a ~5% slope even.The instructions are not very clear, but it was straight forward enough to connect the power and pair the remotes.  I added the Seco-Larm E-931-S35RRQ sensor recommended by reviewer D. Arev’s, and I think that is a MUST HAVE since this gate is so strong it could hurt someone or a child (honestly I think it should come with one).  The photo D. Arev posted is super helpful for how to wire this in, because it was not intuitive what wire to connect where from looking at it.The remotes have good range.  I can click and open the gate from several houses down in the alley of ours.  I bought a CO-Z keypad that I put in the ally to be able to open it without a remote and it works well.Also, I added Homekit connectivity using the iSmartGate controller with their gate sensor which works great.  I love being able to use my phone to open/close the gate when I am driving/walking up to it.  To do this I ran a low voltage control wire from the CO-Z gate motor to my garage, in a conduit, that connects to the iSmartGate controller (that I also use for my garage door to be on Homekit) and installed the magnetic sensor at the leading edge of the gate and the magnet on the steel closed side post.  There is a guide on the iSmartGate website on how to wire it to the CO-Z motor.

Just had a $1800 Liftmaster go out after 4.5 years.  Had to replace a $300 circuit board during this time. Had hesitated before - but with this last issue was NOT giving the big name another $2k.Let me tell you- this is a much smaller unit that I expected.  Dynamite comes in small packages- it handles this heavy gate with ease.  For the money - you cannot beat it. Yes, you have to install magnets to stop the gate.  But again - doing the math I can get over separate remotes for the gate and garage door.  Give it a shot - it will take some elbow grease to install.  It will also take some patience to get magnets just right.

Yariel Palacios,5.0,2020 10 April,"
I bought because of the price and good reviews in regards of strenght.Day1 - install a concrete pad of 1.5' x 1.5' with 120V power using cable 12 at least.Day2- the chain- the gate required to be extended on the back side at least 2'. This will allow the chain to be pulled for opening.  The connecting and disconnection of the chain links is some painfull. I created a small piece of wood with a mechanical cube and cement tascon screws to perform the pin removals easily and leave the anxiety for other parts of the installation.Day 3 - the installation.  I installed it on a day off the Quarintine for covid-19 no stores were opened I used all the materials from an old Microwave.  The cable and the lug nuts, washers, in fact everything needed for the installation.Ensure to have a really small flat fine screwdriver and prepare to dig a small hole in the plastic case to access some of the screws.Also ensure to have plates to hold the end for the angle. There isa big problem for gates in the Caribbean where the pole does not allow a lot of room for the magnets.  I had wished the gate magnet reader was vertically alligned with the chain to have a better distance for the magnets and will not required too much improvisation.  I had to put a limit switch in parallel with the magnet for redundancy system.At the end is solent enough and strong enough.Btw it can take a few days for an unexperience person with gates openers

FlyTheCorp,5.0,2021 12 October,"
I was doing a fair amount of research on which sliding gate opener to get.  Our gate opening is 20 ft and the total gate is 30 ft.  The style is a metal frame with redwood pickets, so the thing is not light.  Comparing to other more notable names in the gate opening business, the CO-Z unit was almost 10X cheaper.  I figured a couple hundred dollar gamble was worth it.Pros:-Very simple to install.  The instructions are trash, but the youtube videos out there will get you by-Strong enough to handle our gate-Magnetic stops are easy to figure out.  With sprockets facing away from you, left is lower.  Simple as thatCons:-instruction manual for wiring in a safety sensor would have been nice.  There are other reviews out there with pics of the wiring that will help you-Remote control couldn't be programmed to our built in car homelink

Great purchase!! This was easy to install but the instruction are super minimal and hard to use!! You need YouTube and common sense believe me! The sensors gave me the most headache but once i figured one is up and one is down (install one end an inch higher then the other) it was all gravy. I’m getting more remotes and a infrared sensor too so no one gets hurt and I’m gonna be all set. Very happy with this gate opener.

 I installed this a couple of months back, so far so good. I wanted to share a video so you can see my gate size, and setup.I bolted the the motor frame down with four concrete anchors, the positioning of the magnets is as others explained (one higher than the other). The magnet distance to the motor needs to be pretty close. i used some threaded bolts and spacers so i could adjust and position them easily, i have them pretty close but not touching the motor case. I bought a 50ft 14/3 gauge extension cord from home depot, cut the end off, wired it to the board, and simply plugged the other end into a regular 110V socket.  The wiring is temporary for me, I plan to use a solar panel and battery, i only use the gate a few times a day so could easily use a solar setup.The setup works really well. The price of the system is really inexpensive, the quality is good for the price - but not the best quality components, but really what could you expect for less than 200 bucks! The remotes work from a good distance. You cannot get your car or garage opener to operate the motor, according to the sellers, the remotes are the only way to open and close the gate - we have four of them. only the top button does anything, the other two buttons do nothing. the chain is showing some signs of rust - i guess that is to be expected and can easily be replaced.the motor easily opens my big metal gate, this sucker is powerful! my wife and i enjoy using it, makes like a little easier :)if this one can last for a couple of years, I will buy a 'backup' motor since they are really quite inexpensive.

I'll be honest its hard to give a product a 5 star because there are always some kind of issues. When you receive this opener you'll think it was a toy. It’s really is small. Don't let that throw you off. This little thing works. I figured that for the cost you were going to get much less than you do with the larger pricier big name brands. Let me jump into it and tell you the pros but also the obstacles I had to hurdle to get get it to work.Upon reading other reviews you definitely need to purchase the outdoor safety sensor. I purchased this one:Seco-Larm E-931-S35RRQ Enforcer Indoor/Outdoor...SECO-LARMWhy do you need a safety sensor because you need to make sure the gate stops or retracts if something crosses its path. This little motor is no joke it is strong enough to crush anything in its path including a child.The sensor came with the following cables Black, Grey, White, Blue and Brown. I added a picture to show you how I wired it. *Disclaimer I am not a licensed electrician. Wire at your own risk. This worked for me.The system won't really operate correctly without a safety sensor. If you decide on getting this motor, the first thing I recommend is read your manual and get familiar with it. I connected everything before installing it just to see how it would work. This system uses magnets as limit switches and you need to get a good feel for how these work. You have a top and a bottom magnet each one with the intention of stopping the gate at the desired travel distance. Play with it and you'll get what I mean. I also installed an on/off switch in an enslosed waterproof 2 gang box so that I can turn off the motor in the event of an emergency or if I just want the gate to stay open with out it automatically wanting to close. This beats turning off your breaker from your house.

Great little motor for the price. Have to modify your gate to install the stop sensor at end other then that great also the release lever to unlock the motor is weak and will lock on its own. So if your power goes out and you an lock the motor to get out better leave the gate open good chance you get locked out like what happen to me after adjusting was able to work but wouldn’t trust it.

These gate controllers (I have 2 gates) have been solid units.  They are easy to install and the directions are mostly clear.  It is important to have a solid base or the controller will rock back and forth and will change alignment.  It is easy to program the remotes.  I have 20 ft gates and they work without any problems.  I would buy again.  One last note:  the non-driving rollers on the gate should be lubricated at the time of installation since they are not lubricated at the factory.

Like most of the people said the instruction suck. But this little unit work very well. I made a mistake by installed the base first, it end up I have to adjust the chain so that the gear and chain in the same line. If I have to install one more I will install it in the follow order.1. Install the chain, make sure leave extra, because it need to go around the gear.2. install the base and motor, make sure the gear and chain inline.3.connect the power.4.Click on the remote so that you can see the motor working, make sure you remember which direction it turn, use one of the magnet to stop the motor, now you find one open/close limit, install that magnet on the gate for the close or open end. do the same thing for other magnet.5. attach the chain to gear. do you remember which magnet stop which direction? very important here, because your magnet only work with this direction, attach the chain on top or under the large gear so that the gate will move left or right to get to this magnets.6. you are done with the install.7. optional, install a sensor. one of the reviewer has the wiring picture, which also work for me.I don't know if there are any different between the open or close limit, by attach the chain to the gear differently, you can move the gate left or right while the gear turning same direction.

We bought this automatic gate slider. It was meant to come with the packaging damaged but product in tact. The opener arrived without instructions, and the instructions we found online was completely unhelpful. My gate technician did install and he noted that the overall quality relative to the gate opener that I had was not as high quality. Well 6 months later, the automatic opener no longer works. When we tried the manual release, the plastic broke and the release did not work. The product was purchased January 2022 and comes with a 1-year warranty. I tried to contact the Seller. Appears they are out of business. I tried contacting the manufacturer, but there is no information.

alfa,4.0,2020 13 December,"
I don't understand why the sensors aren't just magnets on the chain, but instead you have to attach an arm with a magnet a VERY specific height and location. Impractical.1) The sensors should be mounted next to the chain, and the activators simply mount to the chain. It would save hardware, mounting and installation time, and space, and would perform beautifully there.2) The installation instructions were not for a beginner. I'm luckily not one, so I managed, but I couldn't imagine being an amateur and installing this.3) Some of the hardware, specifically the washers, were not big-enough to cover the entire mounting hole.The motor starts up very fast and jerks. The frame it's mounted on actually flexes, and I know it won't last forever. It' brand new, and I'm already contemplating failure mitigation.

I'm in the automated gate business. I bought this system because the price is so low. I had to see if it was any good. This is my evaluation.No Warrantee.No tech support.No place or number for ordering replacement parts.Does not use backup batteries. So if the power fails, so does the gate.You cannot use a solar power supply.I understand the installation process, but a new installer might it impossible.If the end magnets fall off or the magnetic sensor fails, the gate won't stop.On the bright side, if it does fail, it has a chain release but it's only accessible from behind the gate with a key.It's very cheap, so order a minimum of two in case the first one doesn't hold up.For the price it's a throw away product, like the old throw away cameras.I don't know how well it works yet because I can't use it. It doesn't have any support for a professional.Because of that, I won't install it for a customer. I might just sell it for what I bought it for, with an explanation and no promise.  There you have it.
"
Johnnybravo,3.0,2022 11 March,"
When installing, no matter what I tried, I could not get it to close after opening it.  It always thought open was closed, and closed was open.  So we always have to push the button again to close it.  I know, minor inconvenience.  the real trouble came after about 5-6 months of ownership.  Now, we have to get out of the car and push the gate while pushing the button to get it to work.  It's like it lost power.
"
Don,5.0,2020 21 December,"
Opener came well packaged and it came quickly - Instructions were good - and if you read them ""thoroughly"" before you install it............you'll be fine - it may require some custom made brackets for the chain ends or limit switches dependent on your specific applications - Just say n.All hardware needed for most installs is included and it came well packaged - I was surprised to say the least at the quality.......very nice......with that said..........I am very happy with this opener - the remotes are well built and work nicely - it's very quiet and it is working well for what I needed it for. Two solid thumbs up for this opener. It was a DIY install on a 14 foot gate - i would recommend it and I would certainly purchase it again.
"
Christy,5.0,2021 25 April,"
This opener is AMAZING! I have a heavy 20+ foot steel gate for our farm entrance. This opener takes 21.45 seconds to fully open it. I installed the Seco-Larm E-931-S35RRQ Enforcer to stop the gate if something (or someone) gets in the way while its closing, an MHCozy 5V 12V Inching/Self-Locking WiFi Switch Module to make it into a smart gate so I can open the gate from my phone, the CO-Z Security Wireless Automatic Entry Gate Keypad, and a Cartell CP3-100 Vehicle Sensor Kit Exit Wand to automatically open the gate as a car exits the farm. Everything functions seamlessly and amazingly quiet. Totally beat out the Mighty Mule and the money we wasted on our old opener!

Nick A.,4.0,2018 3 August,"
The house I rent is enclosed with a security fence with a sliding gate across the driveway.  It's a busy street.  This opener is perfect so I no longer have to get in and out of my truck leaving the tail sticking out into the street while I opened or closed the gate.  Having a dog stopped me from leaving it open.It was fairly simple to install.  The instruction were obviously translated from another language and not perfectly.  Probably a transaltion programs was used.  So, you have to read between the lines a lot.  But if you slow down and think it through, it works perfectly.LOL...I remember the had the start & stop magnet positions backwards.  Use some duct tape to test mount them before doing any drilling.I have had it installed for six months now and have no complaints.  I do want to find a keypad for it though so I can open it without carrying one of the remotes.  Someones else review states the one listed with the ""Frequently bought together"" window is not compatible.  They verified with the keypad manufacturer that this was the case.

 Works great.  Set the opener to auto-close in 45 seconds.  Added all of these items below and I can open the gate from my phone or voice or Alexa app or keypad or LiftMaster garage door openers.  Plus I added a Ring Doorbell to the gate post and I can view and speak to people before opening the gate with one of my Echo Shows or phone.  Added a regular on/off light switch below the opener (as suggested in another post) and I can hold the gate open for a party.LiftMaster 850LM Universal Gate and Garage Door Opener Receiver + DIY 5V 12V Inching/Self-locking Wifi Switch Module (12) + Exterior Digital Universal Gate Keypad Access Control Weather-Resistant Illuminated Stand-Alone Keypad + Seco-Larm E-931-S35RRQ Enforcer Indoor/Outdoor Wall Mounted Photoelectric Beam Sensor + CP3-100 Vehicle Sensor Kit Exit Wand 100 Feet Car Vehicle detector Automatic Gate release Free Exit device

This is my second unit, the first worked well for four years and the only reason I replaced it was because the door where the key opens to use if the electric goes out jammed. For me to use without electric I had to undo the chain and it's a pain because I'm no spring chicken.My decision to go with the same unit was because other than that this item worked great. My son has the same unit, longer than I've had mine and he has never had any problems.

Asked Aleko for help for their old operator chain could not be put back on the drive so I had to trash the Aleko unit.Took me 4 hours to install this new COZ and noticed they made hook up a lot easier by adding a SW! to reverse the motor, if needed.  They also put in a push button terminal.  Both items were clearly marked.  Beats the old method of reversing wires, and jumping push button connections.  I used my old magnets and chain.  Both just needed slight adjustments.  I also used the old Aleko mount stand instead of having to assemble the COZ stand.  Now I have 2 units 50' apart, and both operated by single remote controls.  I programmed the top button for the big gate, and the bottom button for the little gate.  Going get a Budweiser!

Heidi,5.0,2019 30 November,"
I had to come back and leave a review for this gate opener.  The price and the reviews convinced me to give it a try.  It did not disappoint.  It has been installed for 7 months (since April) and it has been great.  We bought the sensor, the keypad and several remotes.  They all work well together.  The husband had to get a little creative installing the sensor (attached it to a piece of 2x4 which he attached to the rolling chain link gate).  This unit is one quarter the size of our old one, but it does the job and then some, including handling snow and freezing temps this weekend (we shoveled the track first).  We are going to install a second unit at the driveway entrance from the street which we share with our neighbors.Update after 3+ years...this unit and all accessories are still going strong.  No issues whatsoever.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 13 March,"
Love it!!! Working perfectly!!!I had a fence and a rolling gate built and installed closing off my front yard, the gate is a 2""x2"" metal square tubing frame, 15' long and 4.5' high with 3/4” square tubing bars every 4"", pretty heavy gate...This little motor is rolling it back and forth with no effort at all, it is very quiet and works smooth every time.Installation was super easy, the instructions are very clear and straight forward, I also bought the completable safety photonic beam, installation and wiring was super easy and it works perfectly too.I installed an On/Off switch on the junction box at the end of the conduit that sticking out of the concrete right next to the unit and a dedicated arc fault breaker in the panel.So far I am VERY satisfied with this unit and would highly recommend it also because of the amazing price, I just love it when you are not being over charged just to put a brand name stickr on the unit's cover and you get a really good product.Thank you Co-Z.

Lionel,5.0,2021 25 August,"
I like the quietness of it. It was easy to install and adjust the sensors. It came with everything that is required to mount the unit and the chain to the frame. It comes with brackets for the sensors, but need to mount it to your gate how ever you can. My gate is 12feet wide and I needed to make an extension to the gate for the chain. I needed about 14 feet of chain, it comes with 2 10foot pieces.

I just installed mine today  and i’m surprised for the performance.  It took me a day to install the unit ! And that’s  only because I had to run down to local hardware store to buy some brackets and some other things ,  most hardware’s are included ,  and it all depends on your gate style ,  you might not needed. The unit is really small and quiet and it’s fast . If you are a handyman guy and fix stuff at your house ! Then you can do this with no problem at all , The owners manual is not that friendly  but like I said if ur handyman  guy then you can do it . They unit pulls max 220 watt so you don’t need to run Electrical wire to your breaker panel that’s just simply a waist of time . 220 watt is = two old light bulbs 💡💡 or = two 55” flat tv 📺📺 .  I just connected mine to an extension cord temporarily .  Overall great products  . Will see how long it will last .Update: 02/25/22Works like a champ . I am happy with it

 I have been using this gate opener for more than 1 year. Two family members open a 20'x5' gate made of 4"" box tube every day. Not a single problem. The only thing that I think would make it better is having some type of spring to absorb the initial shock when the gate opens and closes. I would buy another one if I had a need for it.

SAyers,5.0,2019 20 July,"
Amazing equipment for the price. I have a large steel 12ft sliding gate and this unit moves it with ease. I was concerned when I read that the unit was single speed, but in practice it really hasn't been that big of a deal even with my heavy gate (over 400lbs). I also bought the IR sensor recommended by another buyer, but it was about $45 and came DOA. I found another unit on Amazon almost exactly the same for $19.99.  There is no way to buy the parts and DIY an opener for less than this pre-made unit. Remotes work great. I saw a video on Youtube where some guy had pretended (he paid an installer and forgot to mention it in the video) to have installed the unit, he really downplayed the effort necessary. If it's your first install then this is not a 30 minute install project.  Heavy duty parts, not cheap junk. Working fine in 105F summer heat.

 I am totally satisfied with the CO-Z gate opener. It's so easy to install, some customizing required for me but nothing over the top to get it to work. It's super quiet, has a good open/close speed. I was sold on the fact that you can add additional controls, key pad and a safety stop sensor. They are all easy to install/program. The quality of the gears and motor all look good, keep it lubed and maintained and I think it can last for years... Hopefully. The price compared to the much bigger and expensive ones is amazing. Doing this my self was the best way to go. I saved $1200 from a quote by a professional. Definitely would recommend.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 28 June,"
This product for me was worth every penny. I can even say I got a bargain. This little thing kicks butt. My gate is about 30' long and this opener opens and closes the gate with ease. The install is surprisingly easy and anything and everything you need is provided for you. I purchased the Seco-Larm E-931-S35rrQ Enforcer photoelectric Beam sensor for it but in actuality as long as you are paying attention to what you are doing and only move your vehicle past the gate when it has stopped opening or closing, you don't really need it. It is definitely a great added feature so its up to the user. I purchased it on June 24th and installed it on the 27th so far I have only used it for testing so if anything comes up after this post I will include it here. If I haven't posted anything, it's because this little thing is still going strong. I would definitely recommend this product.

Purchased one of these in 2019 and it has already failed, so I had to buy another one so I didn't have to re weld any new mounts or brackets. Battery life on the remotes are fair, the chain and sprockets have rust on them already from the rain (yes I lubricate it every month). For the price, it's an OK system.

Parker,4.0,2021 31 March,"
Product itself is great. Easy install, easy to use. However the package I got was missing the key to open the gate manually. I contacted customer service and they pretty much blew me off and won’t send a new key for a few bucks because I did not notice it soon enough. 4/5 stars for the product. 0/5 for the service. I’ll remember when I order another opener for my next gate. Thanks

All together, worth the money.Instructions are ruff. Really have to pay attention. But as far as strength. It will pull the concrete up!!My biggest set backs were (1) motor has to be mounted at gate start/opening pole.And (2) THE MOST IMPORTANT!!! IF you get it all wired and working and it either doesn't stop proper or open proper, the limit magnets can't travel thru the same path!!In other words. They pass across the square limit block on motor.thats how they shut offIf start magnet passes by bottom of square, make stop pass by top of square. This took me 2 days and a bunch of bracket fabrication to finally figure out. Ended up being simple. Example: imagine a line drawn thru the center of square. Make one magnet contact thru top line and other contact thru lower. Works fine
"
William C.,3.0,2021 26 October,"
This is a good gate opener.  Installation was straight forward with YouTube video help.  But I discovered a flaw in this gate opener.  It does not have a run limit or an auto reverse if it senses an object in the path of the gate.  If the magnet limit switches should fail, then the motor will run until the cows come home.  Maybe not a big deal, but one prospective buyers should be aware of .

 Don’t let this little motor fool you, it has power.  Moves an iron gate effortlessly,  I tried pushing on it as it is closing and it keeps going.  I recommend installing a photo sensor in the event a child, animal or car gets in the way of it closing. I installed the Co z in about 4 hours .Also works with ALEKO LM104A Safety Photocell Infrared Photo Eye Sensor
"
Paul J. Camp,3.0,2018 30 June,"
So it works. Eventually. But you pay a price for going for the half price Asian imports.The documentation sucks. You have to guess that the dimensions are all given in millimeters. That's a minor problem.The docs give you instructions on how to set all five of the three DIP switches as well as all four of the zero variable resistors. If you need any of those functions, your guess is as good as mine.The docs are very explicit on how to press the LEARN switch on the circuit board once to sync your remote with the device. There is no LEARN switch. There IS a switch labeled ANTENNA and it happens that it will switch he device into learn mode -- if you press it twice.The open and close limits are set by magnetic switches. The docs give you instructions to mount the magnets are certain distances above the chain. Those distances are exactly backward. You can either remount them or notice that there is a switch labeled REVERSE on the circuit board.That might mean reverse but given the fact that ""learn"" is spelled ""antenna,"" you never know. Turns out it does so if you follow the directions and get the magnets in the wrong place, flip that switch.You're also likely to be shorted on hardware. I was missing two hex nuts so now you go on a search for a hardware store with metric galvanized hex nuts (hint: Lowes).I think that's everything. Good luck.
"
KelleyH,4.0,2020 13 March,"
I love the gate opener itself.  So convenient now to not having to get out and open gate!  But you need to watch videos and read through others comments to actually know how to install.  The instructions are terribly written (if you want to call it written).  And yes, there are some modifications that need to be made in order for the gate to work properly, depending on your gate type.  I have a standard 12' chain link rolling gate and had in stall 2 pieces of aluminum tubing at each end the make the gate stop.

gadgetman,5.0,2021 16 January,"
Great so far. Shockingly small, but quiet and powerful. Hard to go wrong at this price. You can use vehicle HomeLink and other remotes by adding Linnear Multi-Code Receiver # 109950. (see mounting on base in photo 1. ) $30 on Amazon. Change DIP switch #1 to ""off"" (see blue switch in photo 2). On plug ""X5"", put receiver red wire on terminal ""+24VDC"" , Black wire on ""GND"" terminal. On plug ""X7""put one gray wire on terminal ""CLS"" and the other gray wire on ""COM"". Works like a charm !

Love the price and access to support videos.  I took my sweet time doing each task after researching.  Very simple shipped fast easy to install.

So I watch it to make sure it’s functioning properly.
"
Peter,4.0,2017 5 June,"
The instructions are awful and the magnet stoppers aren't necessarily precise.  I recommend placing the magnets in closer than necessary and mark down the exact stopping location so you can adjust accordingly to avoid having the gate slam into the wall that your gate shuts against.  If the gate can just free roll, this might be less important, but something to consider!Otherwise, this is an amazing product for the price.  Seems to be well made and properly sealed for weather resistance.  It is insanely quiet, I'd say about a quarter of the decibel level of a garage door motor or less.Bedroom window about 20ft from the motor while open only allows you to hear the gate roll, no motor noise.I only am giving it 4 out of 5 stars because of the poor instructions.  If you have the ability to weld and fabricate, that can come in handy too.

RC,3.0,2017 12 June,"
This gate opener was easy to install and works very well on my home made wood 16ft gate. The instructions were very bad, and so I had trouble setting up the sensors, but once I got it figured out, it worked fine. I would have given it 5 stars, but it did not have all of the features described. There is no pedestrian mode, where you press a button and the gate opens a few feet and stops. I can open the gate a few feet and stop it, using the remote, but that is not a specific pedestrian mode feature. The 4 button remote is a waste of buttons, unless you have 4 gate openers. The buttons are not for open, close, and stop like the description says, it is just the same button that open, stops, and closes, kind of like a garage door opener. Lastly, if the gate encounters an object, it just keeps pushing. I damaged part of my gate because of this when I was adjusting my sensors. The motor kept running and ripped the bracket off of my gate, damaging the wood. So if there is something in the way of the gate, there will be a battle to the death. You can add a sensor, but it does not come with one. I added a wifi garage door opener switch so I can use my cell phone to open the gate, which is a nice addition.

 The install was very easy. It moves my 600lbs 18ft Metal gate easily! At first I wasn’t sold on the remotes. It’s very basic. With some research I found out that I could connect it to a E-Welink WiFi Switch.Amazon sells it for $12.99.Now I can open the gate when I’m not at home. I use it along with my Ring Spotlight Camera when I get a notification that someone is at the gate. I can let them in and close it when they leave.

Guillermo M.,5.0,2020 8 April,"
Took about two hours to install. Our gate is 18 ft long and takes 22 seconds to open. While it is not the fastest is it very much worth the price. Plus, the slower it opens the safer. Includes two remote controls already registered to the motor. The distance of the control is excellent. Works from a fair distance. If you need more remote controls, order from them. You need to open the motor and open the circuit box. Quick to register new control. Just hold the black button for two seconds and click any button on the new remote control.We love this motor. Very happy.

 Works great! Easy to install. We’ll need to reinforce the slab though. If it ever runs past the limit when closing (like it did once when I was testing the position of the limit) it came close to tipping that slab. It’s because the slab isn’t deep enough so... my fault! Other than that it’s perfect.

Tech support is horrible! Still have not received a call back. I mounted opener on right side and the switch is in FWD position. However, the gate will not auto close. It auto opens. Do I need to switch the motor wires? If only they would call me back! Other than that, I like the opener even though the directions are a joke! Thank goodness for all the “how to” videos out there.

kbt,4.0,2019 21 January,"
Like others have said, once installed this is a great little unit.  Strong, smooth and quiet operation.Our particular metal sliding gate configuration made mounting the magnets very difficult, as the magnets need to be very close to the sensor to work.  We ended up getting an experienced contractor to install this for us.  He had to make the proper welding adjustments on the gate to position the magnets so they worked.  He was also an electrician so he was able to understand the manual.  I did not want to struggle with it.This is the most official Youtube installation video I found for this opener, although it doesn't have sound:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSomiN6vEPM&t=3s  (Chain SL600ACL Installation)

I used this product for a 20' sliding gate. I'm happy to report that it operates well, but the instructions may not be easy to understand. LOOK UP THE VIDEOS! There is a complete library of videos on YouTube to answer any question or make anything clear that you may need to know. Happy, happy, happy.

I purchased a COZ very excited, it worked for a couple of months opening and closing well and now he just opens and you have to physically close the gate after opening up the lock. Did some research apparently this is a problem and the seller is not cooperating.  Poor service and product
"
DEFcon Remodels,4.0,2018 29 December,"
BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS PAGE--- THE ALEKO REMOTES AND WIRELESS KEYPADS THAT ARE RECOMMENDED/FREQUENTLY BOUGHT TOGETHER DONT WORK WITH THIS OPENER.STILL WORKING ON FINDING REMOTES AND KEYPADS THAT ARE COMPATIBLE.Opener doesn't have as many features as advertised.  The 4 button remote only uses one button and that moves the gate in the opposite direction of its last movement.  No auto stop if it hits an object, or person, it just keeps pushing.It works good. Strong motor.  Slow.  Quiet.  Setup takes a bit but not too complicated.Other than that its like a lot of budget openers; no tech support, limited info online, no warranty, but cheap.
"
Excalibur,5.0,2021 3 January,"
I have installed several professional grade gate openers.  I was very suprised to see how well this opener worked. It has been installed for 3 days now and is working like a champ.  My only complaint was that mine was supposed to have 40 ft of chain and it only came with 20ft.  I wish it had 2 knockouts for the wireing.

Googlebite,4.0,2017 11 October,"
Works good once you figure out how to install it. Its been said by many others that the instructionssuck, they are right.  If you have to shorten the chain by removing links be prepared for a little bitof a struggle without the right tool.  Like most I had to come up with custom brackets to hold thelimit switch magnets to the gate. I painted all the metal brackets before installation to slow the rustingprocess down.  Measure twice before installing anything. Installation was about 4 hours countingthe electric hookup and adjusting the start and stop magnets. The motor makes less noise than the gate moving on the metal tracks. The remotes worked rightout of the box and have a long range of at least 100'.

Installation would go allot easier if instructions where clearer. Have several issues that have not resolved... Biggest one is the fact that when programming for gate to close automatically it behaves totally the opposite as it does not close automatically but rather opens and stays open. Contacted seller and the response was to make a YouTube video and share the link with them so they can show it to the tech... How the hell am I suppose to do this when I haven't the foggiest idea how to use YouTube... Problem ""gate opens when it should be closed"" how will a video help you understand this.

Steve,1.0,2019 11 August,"
Don't buy this opener but if you already have and are invested as we were and now need to making it work heres how: Run a Jumper from IR to Com on the circut board only by doing this step not covered anywhere else will your gate both open and close with either a remote control, keypad (optional) or button (optional).I had ordered and got this sliding gate opener in early June 2019, We had to purchase a new gate for $600 for this unit to work with then have cement work done and track laid as well as cementing the motor and bolting to cement. Gate only opened and would not close unless you take it apart and reverse the dip switch on the circuit board then it only closes and wont open. I spent about $800 on labor and tried tech support by Amazon in the Philipines and to no avail as far as troubleshooting the problem! I contacted several managers and tech support insisting that something must be wired wrong from the factory and asked for a replacement which also had the identical problem! It was not until we got a hold of James at Aleko products who has nothing to do with this opener or its remote that he kindly helped us so that we would not have to redo all the  cement work, I would recommend buying from them instead and they are a seller on amazon but have more competitive models that are only on their site. The problem was that a jumper is required from to of the terminal blocks to bypass a photo eye which is stated in the product description as being a feature of the opener NOT an option which is not offered or available on Amazon. The Manual does not cover getting the gate work at all and has horrible grammer and does not make sense.

Nansman,4.0,2018 6 April,"
INSTALLATION NOTE:  Do your own bench test to familiarize yourself with how the motor works in relation to the magnets to automatically start and stop the motor. While the installations leave a lot of information out, the set up is very basic. Electrical hook up is easy. Look at page 16 and find ""Earth Power"" on the diagram, then correlate that to the actual motor circuit board. Pull the module out, open the wire port up by unscrewing the side screw, insert the the black wire into the ""L"" slot, insert the white wire into the ""N'' slot, and the green or ground wire into the ""PE"" slot. Use the key fob to operate the motor.I'll upload other videos on programming the key fobs as I get these installed.

I would give it six stars if I could! What a wonderful little motor! Some things to note:1) Super quiet2) Very strong3) Easy to install4) I had no problems with instructions, they are not IKEA style, but if you read thoroughly they are enough.5) The chain that comes with it is easy.6) Took about 5-6 hours total to complete the project7) We drilled holes in cement and inserted cement anchors and this works like a charm. Super strong.8) Remotes work from really far away.9) My gate is on an incline but it works perfectly anyways!10) The only challenge we had was calibrating the magnets. Instructions don't say that they are actually different. (They look identical). where we realized that the magnets are different from each other, so we flipped them around and they worked perfectly!

Ramon A. Franco,5.0,2021 23 February,"
This was simple install. To take advantage of the max opening of your gate, consider installing your CO-Z on a concrete pad to the side of your driveway, this will allow max opening.  We also installed a CO-Z Wireless Automatic Entry Gate Keypad (not shown), this is very convienient.

I have had this installed about 14months now and it works great for a product I was unsure of. The downside is the chain gets rusted quickly so reqular lubrication is necessary although my regular is whenever I remember. Secondly it doesn't stop automatically if it hits something so becarefur with the fixed time setting if you are not going to pass through on time.

"
Jon,5.0,2019 4 April,"
Very happy with the operation of this automatic gate opener! Istalation is a bit on the tedious side as the instructions that are included leave a lot to be desired. The videos posted by other consumers were extremely helpful and allowed me to install with no issues. I’ve been using the gate opener for about a month now and the operation is very smooth. I wish I could pair the remote signal to the garage opener button on my car as I have done in the past but unfortunately this feature is unavailable. Still 5 starts in my opinion because not having to get out in the rain to open the gate is worth every penny!
"
Muse,5.0,2019 9 August,"
We are handy but we did struggle with the instructions a bit. Actually the initial install was fine where we got stumped was wiring the photo sensors. Once we got that ironed out it works great so far. My hubby lost his remote somehow so we had to get an extra one and the programming was thankfully nothing. Just had to open the motor cover, locate the little black button near top left of control board and press it, then press the button on the remote - it blinked slowly and then that was it boom done. Smart little motor and super quiet.

Not a bad little opener, just installed and everything appears to work as intended, My biggest complaint is the misleading information during purchase. In the ""frequently bought together"" section it shows this opener along with an Aleko LM171 wireless keypad for A?C AR1400 openers and remote transmitters Aleko 2LM123, neither of which I have found to be able to control this opener? Contacted seller of keyless pad and they said this will not work with the CO_Z gate opener, not sure why anyone would purchase these (3) together (as advertised and I purchased) since they do not work together! Kinda like selling motorcycle tires for your new car rims?
"
Micah Gove,4.0,2019 31 January,"
If you can do your own oil changes and brake jobs on your car you can install this unit. Needs a small concrete base. Takes some time and thought to get sensors setup right. One simple thing I found was that when gate opened the sensor would trip it to stop opening but the gate would roll a couple more inches throwing sensors out of time. So I put a stop in the full open position so the gate would stop at the same spot the sensors would kick off the motor. This worked well.

A $200 gate opener??? I was sceptical but bought it anyway based on reviews. Let me tell you this: if you're on the fence, buy it now. Other companies charge 5 times this price. I like that it is small. It was easy to install. If there is one drawback it's the remotes. Others will not work with it and there is no clip for your car visor, but those are minor things.

Most everything but the lack of instructions are awesome. This project was challenging for me, and I consider myself to be a pretty handy guy. If you've read any of the reviews you know the instructions are close to non-existent and what instructions there are, are almost useless. I knew this going in and was confident I could figure it out, and I did, but it took much longer than expected. The only other complaint about the actual product is the brackets for the magnets. I had to fabricate my own. Other than that, it's a nice product. Strong, quiet motor, good quality.

This is NOT a complete kit in anyway. Be prepared with a chain link tool and fabrication skills. Instructions are useless and video is wrong. Once installed the unit does work well and for the price its good. Also important note, there is NO fuse or current overload in the unit! So if the gate gets stuck the motor will keep going till a breaker pops or the motor burn out.

It is very strong and works great.As almost everyone has been saying, the instructions are quite inadequate.Measure before you start placing the brackets and the motor. Remember the chain has to be at the same height with the motor gear. The magnets are used to stop the motor when closing and opening. They are not the same, one is used for opening the other for closing; you have to play with them to determine which is which and where in the back of the motor are the correct spots.This part can be tricky. The system uses very little power.

Installed by novice on a 16-ft steel roll gate and we are very pleased so far.  Was an easy install, but did require a bit of trial & error in setting the stop magnets.  Opens and closes nicely.  We don't understand the 4 button remotes, as it only works on one button (push once - activates OPEN, push again - activates STOP, push again - activates CLOSE).  It does what we need it to do. Still working great for 8 months after install. Thanks

Oh, the remote works about 300 feet!! Crazy. Couldn't be happier after fighting that old Apollo. Great product guys.
"
Chad,1.0,2020 23 February,"
It was actually pretty easy to install. My only issues are with the remotes it comes with. I have to be within 1-3 feet of the motor to get it to open. I have purchased 3 extra remotes with the same results. I asked if there was a way to extend the frequency and someone mentioned changing the batteries, which I did, with no improvement. I also purchased the wireless key pad that goes with this unit and thought it works, it too has to be about 2 feet away from the motor unit which does me no good. The seller responded to my question and flat out told me that the remotes arent compatible EVEN THOUGH they are the ones that came with the unit in the box. I plan on installing another rolling gate but will be forced to go with one of CO-Z's competitors in hopes that the remotes will work at a better range as described.** I'm pretty unhappy with this product. Other reviews lead me to believe I got a definitive model. The whole purpose of this is to not have to get out of the vehicle to open/close gate. The range on the remotes is so terrible that I have to get out and point remote at the opener from 2 feet away at best. What really sucks is, I've already installed it and can't return it now. I hate this piece of crap.

If your even half way handy this gate opener is easy to install. It is nice and quite and opens my 18 foot 3x3"" square tube  gate no problem. It opens about a foot a second. Glad I didnt spend big bucks on some of the openers I was looking at originally. I can replace this one 10 time for the cost of one of those.

It is amazing how this tiny piece of equipment can open and close my gate so easily. So far it has working good for couple of months now. Hopefully it will last. I recommend to everyone who wants to have an easy access to get out your driveway especially during rainy day.
"
Kalel,4.0,2019 23 July,"
The product itself works perfect - Reason why only 4 Star it doesnt bring the tools to adjust the chain so be prepared to hammer and hurting your finger if you need to adjust the chain. Other than that its works pretty good!

Mysterious Shaman,1.0,2022 12 September,"
Couldn’t get the thing to work and had a lot of trouble with customer support, Amazon seller doesn’t want anything to do with it once they have your money. It was a total waste of money.

maria,5.0,2020 5 February,"
For the most part this was easy to install. Watched a few YouTube videos. The hard part was aligning the magnets so it doesn’t slam when the door opens and closes. Love the fact I don’t have to get out of my car to open the gate.
"
Sharon,5.0,2019 24 February,"
I just finished installing this CO-Z Automatic Sliding Gate Opener on our 15 foot sliding RV gate. The instructions along with the online video provided just enough detail for me to figure out how to assemble, install and connect everything. Would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good deal and isn't intimidated with doing their own installation, or even having someone else with good technical skills install it for them.

"
Angel Perez,5.0,2019 8 January,"
I was surprised by the small size of the motor, but it can open and close large doors with ease and minimal noise. We have a metal gate that is 16 feet long and 7 feet high at the highest point. The remote opens and closes from 100 ft away or more when we are driving close to home. Overall a great deal compared to other, more bulky, options.

Jennifer Wenk,5.0,2018 3 April,"
Everything for the unit was easy to install. That took about 2 hours from start to finish. I installed a safety sensor and that was a little difficult due to the sensor tell you to connect to the normally open/close and the unit doesn't identify the connection's that way. The sensor has 5 wire but only use for of them with this unit. Very happy with the unit and for the cost it's well worth it's value.

 Not bad for the price. Was looking for something inexpensive for our chain link fence. Works ok. Just a little worried about rust developing and the impact it may have. Had to improvise just a bit for the stop and go magnetic sensors.
"
michael feld,5.0,2020 23 June,"
Bought this for my 20 foot gate. Easy to install. Works great. Only suggestion would be they should sell it as a kit. You have to buy key pad and inferred sensors separate.
"
Jerry Hampel,5.0,2019 31 July,"
I replaced a near identical unit, worked great for years. So the installation was really simple, the electrical board was slightly different. The instructions are simple, if you can translate Chinese English into English English . So you try and try again, until it works perfect. And it does! A solid unit and works just fine,

betty heiss,1.0,2020 15 June,"
This is the worst product I have ever had the misfortune to buy. The first one lasted about one year. I installed it myself over a period of two weeks. The instructions were written in English, however trying to understand what they are trying saying is extremely difficult because its made in China. Because of the difficulty on installation I paid a gate installer to come out and fix it. He new what it was right away. It was a defective part on the board. So I ordered a new board, and had him out again. The board had the same problem. Each and every time I tied contacting the manufacture with no return calls or emails. So then I ordered a new gate opener, yep you guessed it the same symptoms and problem with the board. After asking them to refund me for the installer visits,  I was very insulted when they told me to get a new one and they would discount it $40.00. Amazon as always was great, and refunded all my cost on purchased items. I will buy another replacement gate through Amazon but not from the company.

For the price not bad! Use it twice a day for a few months so far and it works every time!Over a year old and still no problem! Have added 6 total remotes and still works good. Wish it had a soft start/stop to it and also wish I could hard wire it to a key pad but other than that wouldn’t hesitate to buy another one for the price!

"
Fernando Vallejo,5.0,2019 8 September,"
I like the motor is a nice price and strong, but will be more easy if instructions are better specified so installation will be faster. The hard part to install was how and where exactly place the opening and close sensors. Otherwise I will recommend it, thanks

It’s a hit or miss product. This was the third opener I bought, the first two work fine but in the third opener the sensors don’t work properly. Would recommend if replacement parts are available and the installer should be handy to diagnose and repair.
"
Dan Halderman,1.0,2017 14 July,"
Worked for a few months, then remotes stopped working followed all the steps in the book, changed remote batteries, deleted and re-added the remotes etc.  all my troubleshooting points to a bad circuit board in the unit. I tried to contact the seller Banyan Imports with no success. Can not find any technical support for the product. The troubleshooting tips in the manual are basic common sense things like change battery, reset unit. No information on how to contact manufacturer or warranty. Spend the extra dollars and get a known name brand that has tech support and warranty information.Update: Finally got in touch with Banyan Imports, the re seller of this unit, they agree that it was a bad board and sent me a new one... Received the new board in the mail today, (a day later than promised) was not pleased at all. Box was crushed at one end and absolutely NO packaging material to help keep it protected. Come on people this is a circuit board. If the one that was in the original unit was safe and enclosed in the unit and possibly suffered damage from shipping what makes you think shipping a new board in the smallest box possible with out packaging is going to keep it safe. Will install it tomorrow (Saturday) but not feeling to confident right now.

"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2017 19 June,"
The set up & operation manual is not very good. They leave out one very basic thing to set up & that is the chain. Makes a HUGE different which way the chain is installed to make the gate open & close right. Other than that gate opener works great.

Great purchase, does the job. Self installed it in just under three hours. Instructions are poor, but if your handy it’s not a big sweat. I installed this motor on a chain link gate, so be prepared to creat a home made bracket plate(I used a piece of  2x4) to hold the magnetic limit switches. I will purchase again.

dustin,1.0,2018 28 August,"
The install was a bit of a chore, but finally got everything set up and working correctly. I have had this unit for about 1 year now and it works, but the auto close feature works sometimes and sometimes it doesnt, also the range of the remotes at first were really good after about 2 months use they got to where they would only work from about 10ft or so, I purchased about 8 remotes all with the same performance.  If this unit would consistently work like it did when new it would be ok. Also not a big fan of the magnet system, it doesnt look good on the gate and I had to purchase additional much stronger magnets for the unit to function properly.Update:  Unit quit working all together, went ahead and got another one, the opener came damaged with a big crack in the cover and one of the cover mounting points busted off. The packaging did not look damaged, which leads me to believe they shipped it out this way.

We bought two of theses gate openers last Nov 2017 which are easy to install and gates worked great. We are coming to our year mark and only one gate motor works now. The main gate motor will no longer open the gate we can’t even re program the remotes  which we thought was the problem at first. there is a red light on so we know it has power. We are no longer  eligible for return or replacement on amazon. And the manufacturer is painfully hard almost non existent to get ahold of. To bad for the money I would have expected these gate openers to work longer than a year!

Adrian Gonzalez,1.0,2017 17 December,"
I know I should have gone with my gut instinct this purchase. I'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for but I took a chance with this gate opener. I was excited after I had read all the 5 star reviews. I also read all the 1 star review and had major concerns since the 1 star reviews mostly talked about the motor and the parts being bad, but I bought it anyway. Of course it was too good to be true. It only took two weeks for the motor to burn out. BUYER BEWARE, this opener sucks!  I'm now going to have to pay my electrician to come out yet again to install a new motor. What pisses me of the most is that this same electrician told me not to buy it. =( I have no idea why Amazon is allowing this crap to be sold on their website!

I finally got this installed,  due to pandemic could not get anyone out to install. Yes it has been in my garage since the end of 2019 but just opened and apparently it is defective.  I contacted support and they said sounds like a problem with the limit switch. They suggest i but a new one and they will give me a 20% discount.  I would have hoped for better service than that. It really is not my fault noone would install.

the gate wont close  it will open to close you  have to push button up to 20 times and it might close.  when you push the close button the gate moves about one inch on each push  al beit the same inch.

 I wasted my time to install everything..it just doesn’t move my gate…light is on; close and open light is on…we can see the motor move without chain however when we put chain on , it doesn’t budge…Plus the emergency switch make me scared if something goes wrong that switch is easily break from the motor.Save yourself money and time…get different gate.I will return and hopefully they give my money back…since it does not work and it is still within 30 days return window.

Perfect. Feels like I have a high end gate opener. Installed fuss free and worked. Wish I could figure out where to put the N.O for my sensor.I dropped my stars not for the product which is perfect for me but because of lack of support. I need to hook up my sensor but the slots are filled with the wired from the magnets. No way I can see to talk to someone.

The analog magnet switch to decide when to stop the gate is beyond stupid. Installed everything in about two hours but have been playing with magnets now for two days and it's only getting more depressing. The amount of time I've invested plus the cost of the equipment I've passed the cost of the quote given to me by a company that would have installed good equipment. If looking to do it yourself buy something with automatic sensors to detect if the gate is open or closed.

Pollo Loco,1.0,2020 30 September,"
Horrible gate opener. I have had several gate openers over the past 20 years and this one has been the worst. Would only work in one direction and the latch to disengage was stuck in the open position. I could not get ahold of any tech support. Returned after not being able to get to work. Save your time and money and buy a better and more expensive brand.  ☹️
"

Can someone from this company please contact me back I’ve reached out several times with absolutely no response. The machine is only closing the gate halfway, it pulls open fine and worked closing for 3 weeks and now only goes about half way, it does not even come near the magnets and I have to assist it with a little tug to make it keep going. Not satisfied with the motors performance and my gate weights about 250 lbs at most

"
Hudson,1.0,2019 30 May,"
I bought this unit last year and installed it myself.  The opener itself works fine but it has no sensor to prevent it from closing on your car. The instructions say you can get one, but after a four month search and the purchase of one the seller says will work, it still does not. So far it has damaged four cars and the seller still offers no solution. all I want is to buy the correct sensor.

Spend the extra $100 bucks and go with the Aleko, we had it five years and needed a replacement because the hurricane damaged it. the Aleko AC2400 was out of stock so went on the cheap and ordered this one.

I only give it 4 stars due to the lack of keypad option, poor Chinese/English instructions and Amazon's incorrect suggestion for accessories. Otherwise, the gate opener has been (so far) excellent, specially for the price. The ""little"" motor packs a punch. It operates my 18', 500+pound gate without any issues. Takes some time to decipher the Chinese/English-written manual, but the wiring schematics are accurate.#1. No, this opener will not work with the Aleko 171 (or any other wireless keypad).#2. There are two options for control boards made for this model. Amazon describes ""pedestrian mode' as well as a myriad of other options that are not available with this purchase. This particular model comes with the PY600ACN control board and not the ""Smart Control Board (which is the one with these additional options).#3. Limiter switch is controlled by the 2 magnets. They are very sensitive as to the placement in relation to the control board. The metric measurements, in the manual, are of little help. Use ""The Google"" to figure out what they mean in inches. the 35 and 97 height measurements are in MM, not CM.#4 Unit is set from the factory to open from the right side of the gate. If you need it to open from the left there is a SW1 switch that has to be selected (again, I'm translating what seems to be a vague description of a fairly important function)#5 The control board has 24V output voltage, making it pretty difficult to pair with any 12V accessory (wired keypad, IR sensor, etc..)You can buy additional remotes (which are super-easy to program with the use of a ""learn button"" on the control board). https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0197QYJCC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1This begs the question as to; why in the world can't  a wireless keypad be synchronized with the opener in the same manner as a remote? It's a mystery...

You have to mess with the hardware a bit, and it may even require additional hardware depending on your specific configuration (as I had to), but all-in-all it's a nice little motor.  I would caution you to NOT have too heavy a gate, as that might overwork the unit.  I was originally going to use a wood-clad (2""x6""s, 2""x4""s), steel-framed gate, but after doing the weight calculations it would have weighed 600-700lbs (not to mention the lumber cost)!  I opted instead to use a 75lb, steel tube gate ($200 @ Tractor Supply Co.), which in practice, weighs even less when it rolls so very little stress on the unit. Also, this set-up is definitely not typical.  Since I had a 14' gate and a 13' 3"" opening to secure I had to extend a horizontal ""arm"" (pipe) outside of the gate's ""Closed"" side frame on which to terminate the chain and attach one of the magnets.  To avoid this hassle make sure your gate is at least 18"" longer than the opening you need to secure.  (And even then that's assuming you mount the unit flush with one of the post's.)
"
steve,3.0,2021 8 August,"
My unit worked fine for about 5 years, now it only works if the remote is one centimeter away from the unit (and that's sometimes) seems like quite a few people had this problem, some said it's a faulty inferred sensor(which I don't have) some said it's the main board, some said its new LIGHT Bulbs that jam signals!??? , and yes I changed my batteries, twice! When it works it's a great unit, but seems like some point in time you will run into this problem, and it's unclear on exactly how to fix it. I'm not sure if the components are not durable.
"
Rick,4.0,2020 24 January,"
Relatively easy to install, works very good, I like the self closing feature.  My only gripe is that the documentation is incomplete.  There are no good measurements as to how far back from the gate to install the unit, etc. With better documentation I would give it 5 stars. I believe that the infrared sensors also should not be an option, the are necessary to safely install the opener to prevent damage to vehicles.

As some have said.. Instructions need some updates.  Inch convertions are noted but you have to look carefully through the book.  Place the magnets 5/8"" away from sensor instead of 7/8"" to work better.  Magnets do stop motor dead upon lining up with the sensor pad.

Raul,5.0,2020 14 May,"
Hi guys I would like to highly recommend this product I have it for about 5 years on a metal gate of about 16f x 6f it was an easy installation and I never have a problem with it always work as it shouldAt one time I thought to install a magnet lock but several times I try to open it myself and that little thing is so strong that I never open it without the remote control so I decided not to install the lockVery good  productAlso if you get extra remotes as I did for all my vehicles is so easy to program itThank youRaul Vazquez

I installed two of these last year 2017 May, the both worked fine for about seven months then one after the other they begin to respond intermittently then not at all. One of them operated on its own then had a humming sound so i had to turn the power off. Had the motors tested and found they were good so the diagnosis is that ths electronic boards are bad.
"
Eugene Fera,2.0,2021 23 July,"
When pushing the gate remote, the gate moves a few inches and then stops.  Push again, same thing.  4 or 5 TIMES.  I usually get so frustrated I get out and manually open.  It ALWAYS CLOSES WITH ZERO ISSUES.  There is nothing on the tracks nor in the path of the eye.  If so, it would not close perfectly every time.

 I'd highly recommend this unit for DIYers. It's easy to install if your handy. Drilling the holes for the concrete was the hardest part. I had a friend weld the mounts for me since I couldn't use the mounting accessories that came with it. I'm planning power this unit using a solar set up to avoid running a power line from the garage.

 Instructions do suck as many people have said. Support also sucks. I asked 3 questions only the least important one was answered and it was wrong. I wasted 3 days waiting on them to respond. So I went on with the installation. I was half way done and got a reply about the sprockets not being in line with the motor.I have to say the product is great if you can work with minimum instructions. This was my first one the next one will be much easier.

 First off this thing is sooooo small that you can virtually install it in any space. Didnt really look at the instruction because the text was so small you couldn't read them anyways luckily youtube has alot of people that have this same opener. I didnt use the supplied bracket because it was too low and in my area the water gets alittle high every now and then. Positioning the sensor was a little tuff and depending on what side you have the dipswitch at is where you set the magnets. I would recommend having a welder buddy as it makes the installation alot easier. Also I would highly recommend installing sensors because this little thing is strong and won't stop til you stop it, there are no safety switches built into the motor itself. Im orsering another one for another house because it serves a purpose for what I need.
"
Jay,3.0,2020 22 July,"
Pros: the motor is quite not very big.Cons: it wont link with the openers in the cars.The magnets to turn the motor off have to lined up exactly. I spend about 2 hours getting in the exact spot to line them up.

 Extremely happy with this product. It’s a very simple gate opener. Worth it.  My suggestion are measure it so it lines up perfectly with the chain before securing the motor to a concrete slabfor the final install.Saved myself $1000.00 - $1,500.00 for the high end products that are available.

It took about 2 to 3 hours to set up and it wasn't that hard, the instructions were pretty clear. If anything you can look up YouTube videos. It only comes with 2 keys, so if you need more just purchase the exact same kind. We've had this gate opener for for a little less than a year and the chain has only fell off once. I think it rolled over a rock, but it was easy to put it back in place. We love not having to slide the iron gate open and close all the time.

Opens my 17' steel frame, picket covered rolling gate with ease. Even has to pull It open at an incline! Pour your pad large so you have plenty of room to position and anchor the motor.  Remotes work awesome and additional are only $10. Such a deal. I was quoted $2500 for a gate opener plus installation costs. Crazy cheap and works awesome.  Came with everything needed but opted to drill and place anchors in concrete after pouring for ideal placement so had to buy the anchors.

Dare I say this has been the best purchase from Amazon of all time?  Could be.  We bought a home 10yrs ago with a sliding gate in the back that protected a driveway to the back garage.  The gate opener was an old mangey beast of sorts, motors, gears, limit switches, antient 286 looking motherboard, hacked RF receivers, all in a huge rusting metal box.  The unit worked a couple years but then started dying slowly.  The contactor would come and go and and then finally it wouldn't work at all after me tinkering with it and spending hundreds of $$ on it.  My guess is the motherboard fried.  Upon getting a quote for $5k from a fencing company to ""replace"" it, I decided to find an alternative. Another company I contacted suggested I look at this product.  Usually these types of things don't' work out, but I can honestly say this one did 100%.  The unit is great, bought two of the CO-Z wireless remote PIN pads, which work great and from 75+ ft away.  The key fobs are a bit heavy but they work from quite a ways away as well.  I was a bit intimidated to install it, but taking it slow, I was able to do most of it by myself.  I did have an electrician friend help me wire it up safely.  The unit just works, and keeps on working, day after day.  So far I've had it about 5 months and its survived rain, snow, near zero temps and keep on going.  I did have one slight problem with the magnet not stopping it when closing, but a vertical adjustment fixed it quickly, not the unit's fault.  If I can remember, I'll post a follow up when I get a full year out of it.

I bought this 2018 and still working. I have a 12 feet custom gate made from 2inch OD pipes and wood which is very heavy and had no problems with the opener. 2 years past and still no sign of any issues or weakness in power. Motor is very strong. Some vibration sounds when it runs but was only coming from the cover which can be minimized easily. I only opened it again because i bought extra key fobs and set it with the machine very easily and no problems. I do not work in trade and have no experience with the install but was able to put it up by myself (excluding electrical work). I read the manual repeatedly to understand how to install it properly.  It even has instructions to add other optional features. Im looking to get an IR gate sensor for additional safety features. Im very satisfied with this mean machine.

Anthony,1.0,2019 9 December,"
I like the price, it was easy to install, it opens my gate under ideal circumstances.I dislike that it has very little power on startup, once the gate is moving it takes a good force to stop it, but you need to keep the chain excessively loose so the motor is up to speed before the chain comes taut and then the sudden jerk will start the gate moving. Not a good recipe for long life. It comes with 2 keychain remotes but good luck getting any extras to work, I have tried several different ones and none will work. I have to reach the manufacturer but so far have been unsuccessful. If I had my time back I would spend the extra for better quality.

Nice batteries and last a long time in various remotes and smart locks. It comes out of the package with 1.58 volts and seems to keep up with other name brand batteries. For the cost, this is a no brainer as it does last just as ling and performance is about equal to other batteries. I have had no issues using theses in flameless candles and for remotes, they seem to last over a year as it is in my FireTV remote. Highly recommend these as they work perfectly with no issues.

I use this in a small ""weather station"" that shows indoor/outdoor temp and humidity. It has a large LCD panel with backlight. I use it with a timer so that when it's during the ""sleeping hours"" the timer goes off and the backlight only runs an additional 15 seconds or so, but otherwise is still updating the display and showing the temps. Batteries last quite a while, and there's no real point to using rechargeable ones.
"
RB,4.0,2022 16 March,"
I think the price for 20 was really good. Problem is there were only 16 in the box. I used 3 each on 5 flameless candles I replaced the batteries for, and there is only 1 left in the box; thus 16 total count. I'm not very happy about that. I'm not sure about the longevity of the product, as this is the first time I have purchased this brand, so we'll see. These were sent really fast (1 day) from Amazon, and I love that.

TonyaS,3.0,2022 28 March,"
I did not expect much for that price, but I only needed them for my Amazon Fire TV remote. I use it once a day in the evening to turn it on, select something to watch, and turn it off again. 2 batteries lasted for about a week. And it wasn't just a fluke. Those batteries are minimally charged and this is horrible for the environment. I bought a set of rechargeable ones from EBL, which is much better for the environment anyways!Edit:So although the rechargeable ones did last a bit longer, I found out that the real problem was that the remote to my fire TV was defective. It was a brand new one so I got it replaced and the rechargable batteries last way longer now. I felt like it was only fair to update this, however, I was unable to test how these batteries actually work, since I had gone through all 20 of them and did not get them replaced.  It doesn't matter though, I love my rechargeable ones. I never have to buy batteries again, when they run out I simply switch them with the other pair and recharge them!
"
Sara,3.0,2022 27 August,"
They do fine for things like the remote, but in something that requires any type of power skip this battery and just buy good ones. They do good in some things though that don't require constant power.

These last a long time in all my illuminated holiday decor.  Very pleased.

****Lee****,5.0,2022 12 April,"
With three kids and tons of electronics I go through batteries rather quickly.  I decided to give these a shot given they were priced more attractively than the name brands I have typically purchased in the past.  To be honest - i wouldn't be surprised if these were manufactured by the name brands and then rebranded to Amazon.  They quality and duration of use seem to be very comparable.  For the price - i can live with any slight differences and am happy with their performance.

These batteries work well for normal daily use in remotes.
"
Michelle Strever,5.0,2022 1 August,"
Use them often
"
Sean Honsinger,3.0,2022 28 July,"
Batteries were very affordable. However, after a short period of use and one of my devices they died earlier than any had before. I thought it might just be a fluke with the ones I had in it but it wasn’t. They just run out very quickly.
"
Susan S. Schmidt,4.0,2022 25 March,"
Brought these for when I forget to charge my rechargeable. Worked good all 8 hours with power to spare, and about half the price as Duracell.
"
Edward Hickcox,5.0,2022 3 May,"
They're batteries. They power things. Haven't had any leak or fail to last. Decent batteries, doing what batteries do. It's nice to have a great whack of them in a drawer because you always seem to not have one when you need a battery.
"
Natalie,5.0,2022 1 June,"
I personally don’t see any difference with other brands but this works what I needed. It doesn't cost like other brands. Good deal and Happy with purchase
"
Dagger of the Mind,5.0,2021 13 September,"
I use this in a small ""weather station"" that shows indoor/outdoor temp and humidity.  It has a large LCD panel with backlight.  I use it with a timer so that when it's during the ""sleeping hours"" the timer goes off and the backlight only runs an additional 15 seconds or so, but otherwise is still updating the display and showing the temps.  Batteries last quite a while, and there's no real point to using rechargeable ones.I use others in remote controls and such devices that are extremely low draw.  Considering their cost and environmental impact, they last long enough in all those devices that rechargeable ones might just start failing due to age ANYWAY, and then I'd be out a lot more money and doing environmental damage never having even gotten the maximum use from them.

Becky A. Melton,5.0,2022 24 May,"
Good for all uses.  Love to buy in larger numbers for convenience.
"
Gail,5.0,2022 12 May,"
I have used these before as the cost is less than name brands.  Never had any problem.
"
Connie P,5.0,2021 23 March,"
I used to only buy name brand batteries and it became expensive to keep replacing them.  So one time, I tried dollar store batteries for my child’s game.  Even brand new, the dollar store batteries did not have enough power to properly operate the game.  I then tried Amazon Basics batteries.  I have been using them for a while now, and haven’t run into any issues like that.  I have not had problems with leaking or corrosion either.  The batteries seem to last a sufficient time, although I really don’t keep track.  Bottom line, these Amazon Basics batteries seem to be good batteries for the money.
"
Herbert J Jurgensen,5.0,2022 19 April,"
Tried these in stead of spending a gazillion dollars for the big name brands and found they work just as well.
"
Jim NC,5.0,2022 15 May,"

"
Jacqui,3.0,2022 25 March,"
I’ve purchased a few batches of these over the years. And I thought I was going crazy when my remote control would die sooo fast. Like, so fast that you realize it. Usually when your remote dies, it happens in a way that you’re like, yea, it doesn’t raise any alarms. But these! So I started paying attention. My remote for my tv dies in 2 months! The gaming controllers die after 2-4 uses! Not worth it
"
Kirk Tyler,5.0,2022 15 May,"
I love the pricing.
"
Princeton Seitz,5.0,2022 13 March,"
These compare very well to Duracell with regards to life from what I have found.  Very good value for the cost point. Will buy again.

Sheryl R. Hahn,3.0,2022 1 June,"
I don't think they last very long but they're probably okay for the price.
"
Paul T. Maack,4.0,2020 16 September,"
I'd say they're superior to most of the dollar store varieties. Actually... all of them. These are pretty good quality. Definitely would recommend for anyone not using a super high drain device, or something that's mission critical. You wanna put these in your TV remote and forget about it? These are your batteries. Clock on the wall? These. Some sort of life-saving device? No. Don't cheap out, buddy.Only issue (if you can call it that) is that it's a huge pack! I have absolutely no idea how I'm going to use all these. Between my TI-83, TI-84 and a couple clocks (and of course my TV remote) I'm pretty well set for the next 5 years on this one purchase.
"
Lee Lightford,5.0,2022 29 April,"
Great
"
Dana A.,5.0,2020 24 November,"
I wanted to reorder this item, but it was out of stock, and I was forced to purchase a well-known name brand.  I won't say the brand name, but they are blue and silver in color.  I use a lot of these in stick-up lights in my dark hallways.  I was shocked how quickly the name brand petered out.  I ordered the Amazon brand again before I was halfway through the others.  I use the Amazon batteries in things that use a lot of power like hall lights and flash lights, and have relegated the name brand to use only in my remotes, where they again under-perform, but not quite as spectacularly as in lighting.
"
Ruthie,5.0,2022 4 April,"

Decent batteries
"
Average Joe 12,4.0,2021 2 January,"
Like a lot of us, when my AAA batteries die they all go at once, or at least it seems!  The AmazonBasics multi pack is a great value, in my opinion.  Do they last as long as the ""name"" brands?  I really cannot say, but I do know the life of these are satisfactory.  Price compare and you can buy these with confidence.  And, I feel with the number of batteries AMZN must sell, I believe their batteries to be fresh.
"

"
Jeff woody,3.0,2022 11 May,"
Don’t last long the power
"
Rich,4.0,2020 21 November,"
I bought these batteries almost exclusively based on the ratings of other reviewers. What make one battery better than another - price versus longevity. The price on these was certainly lower than something like a Duracell but will they last as long? Too soon to tell but I'm betting they won't. However if they last 80% as long but cost 50% as much then they are worth it. Only time will tell.
"
Sara Richards,5.0,2022 3 March,"
Works as describes
"
Rodney Moos,4.0,2021 6 August,"
They work well
"
Ted Shockey,5.0,2020 9 December,"
Bought these after reading reviews and comparisons online. I use them in a foxpro predator call . I cant say how long they'll last but so far 2 days of calling and their still going strong. I checked the voltage in all 48 when I got them cause I was skeptical about how good they are and didn't think they would all check out but they all read 1.620 volts. !!
"
Tuesday,3.0,2022 8 February,"
Just as expected. Now to see the life longevity.
"
A. Berger,4.0,2020 29 October,"
Have bought amazon basics batteries for years.  They used to come in a recyclable cardboard box that stacked well on a shelf and kept the batteries contained.  The new plastic pack is annoying and once you open an end, the batteries tend to fall out all over the place.
"
Derek Webb,5.0,2020 1 November,"
And they work well. The best part about them is the amazon logo with the pretty grey and green. Sometimes I just lie there in bed, caressing the batteries close to my heart. They're so pleasurable. They can provide energy for a variety of products, including tickle me elmo's and other rubbery-devices: such as remote controls and hand held flashlights. Aint nothin basic bout deez bad boys.
"
Kenneth M.,3.0,2022 23 January,"
It was cool
"
Avidproxy,5.0,2021 17 June,"
Unless you're buying these at the Dollar Store (not usually great expiration dates on those, though), the Amazon AAA batteries are a good value for the amount of them you get.  Work well, good price, far-off expiration dates.
"
Brianna M,5.0,2021 26 August,"
Great cheap batteries, that last pretty long!I use them for my TV and Xbox control and they last forever. STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!!
"
Bill,5.0,2021 5 July,"
I saw a video review on YouTube and the Amazon batteries did well in a side-by-side test with several other brands so I bought these batteries with high hopes.Really a very good price.
"
David J,1.0,2022 20 October,"
These are actually really great, but this time the package was stolen (I know, boo hoo, right), and all I wanted to do was report it. Giving the same review for all the items in the package. Sorry to be annoying.
"
GoodVibes,1.0,2022 3 May,"
I cannot believe I have not deleted these off of my subscribe and save, I'm so disappointed in myself! I bought these batteries mainly for my LED lighted makeup mirror that only takes batteries. There are very few things in my household that take batteries these days. Well it takes four of these batteries and they last a whopping three days every single time I change them. So at least twice a week I am changing his batteries. I did the math for the higher priced brand-name batteries in these by far are not the better deal. And to add on the frustration of having a dim light right when you need it the most and having to swap out batteries when you are already running late for a hot date  it definitely is not worth it!
"
David Salerno,5.0,2021 27 June,"
At first I was skeptical about these batteries, but they have not let me down.  When so many devices require batteries, it's important to always have some on hand.
"
Luke'sMom,5.0,2021 30 June,"
Cylindrical, triple AAA, keeps the TV remote control alive and well.  It’s a particularly important member of the family, the tv remote, as one may suspect.
"

Right sizes. Good storage container they come in. Best bulk buy prices. We live where tornados hit last year so this bulk got us prepped and ready for bad weather. Will buy again when we get low.

We've used these in tv remotes so they should last a while, but don't. Won't buy again. Unusual for an Amazon Basics item.

You get what you pay for. They work but do not last as long as a Duracell. They are better used in items such as a remote not anything that uses a lot of power such as a remote controlled car
"
Shopper,1.0,2022 27 June,"
They maybe cheaper, but in the end...Im spending more money bc they don't last. I won't be buying them again. They are a step above the Dollar Tree batteries that die so fast they are annoying. The leaking battery is just unacceptable. I had higher expectations of something Amazon puts its name on. Lowering the bar.
"
Madison,1.0,2022 5 March,"
Day 1 the lights were pretty bright. Day 2 is the second photo. Needless to say I went through an entire pack of 15 in 3/4 days. I use these tiny lights for maybe 3/4 hours per evening. They’re off all day because I use natural light for my aquariums, and I turn them off when I go to bed. So, these batteries suck— in other words. Waste of money and time. Should’ve just bought the good brand for a few extra bucks.

I use a portable nebulizer and these batteries or the 2 nebulizers we’ve purchased from Amazon as well. Neither are working after I use the batteries for 1 week. I’ve wasted about $150.00 trying to save a few bucks but as we’ve heard, we get what we’ve paid for. Junk. Since all this, I ended up having to get an electric nebulizer from Medicare and that thing is very loud but at least it works, not mobile though. What do I do?  Settle? I suppose. Disappointed? For sure.

I thought AMZ was an expert in logistics, not batteries. After buying these cheap batteries, I soon realized why they’re so cheap -they’re not good! Stick to the name brands Energizer-Duracell for a few dollars more. You get what you pay for. AMZ should stick to logistics.

We used these in everything just to see how they could handle it. They can do Everything a Duracell can but it doesn't last as long under heavier loads. I used 3 for my waterproof shower lights and they lasted a month where the Duracell will last an extra 2 weeks at least.

Sam,5.0,2022 22 October,"
Covid straight up ruined my hair skin and nails. My old cuticle oil wasn't cutting it as my nails became dryer and dryer. Biotin supplements did nothing to help. I ordered this hoping for the best. Boy, did this deliver.No lie, after one night my nails are soft and crazy moisturized. It smells fantastic. Very light scent. A little sweet( like honey) but not sickly sweet like a lot of products can be. I want to BATHE in this. Right now, I'm content for my nails getting some much needed love. I've already recommended it to others, and will be buying some more to give as gifts.

 This is by far my favorite cuticle oil, and I will always go back to buy more when I run out. It smells very pleasant, but not too strong. It’s very hydrating, and is essential when growing strong, healthy nails! I like to dab a very small drop into each cuticle, and gently massage it in and all over my nails as well, let it sit for 5-10 minutes, then use some lotion on my hands to help seal it in. I do this twice a day every day, and I have seen a huge difference. Highly recommend:) It has made my nails SO much stronger also. Such an amazing product!

 I applied it once and my cuticles look great automatically. My skin soaked it up with no issues. You only need a tiny amount. I love that the dropper is narrow at the tip allowing for precise application but I was really looking forward to that amazing milk and honey scent which is NOT there. I purchased this specifically for the scent but it doesn't compete in that area. A bit bummed out about it considering the price.
"
Lis,3.0,2022 10 September,"
It’s not bad but it’s not good. I been using it consistently for a week or so and notice no difference. It also leaves my hands oily for a long time which I don’t like. Can’t tell what the hype is about
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 13 May,"
…and I know my cuticle oils. I have the worst, driest cuticles known to humankind. I’ve blown through bottle after bottle of other oils, which I had to apply multiple times a day to have any effect. This stuff needs to be applied 1-2 times a WEEK, max. That + price point + pleasant, light milk and honey scent make this a holy grail for me.
"
Sue,4.0,2022 28 March,"
Moisturizing but, there really is no scent to it. Seems like an oil. Just add a little to have healthy cuticles and nails.

Sooooo, I do my own nails at home and I also do my husbands once a week since he works in remodeling and his finger nails look terrible so I give him a little manicure and I take this cuticle oil and massage into his nails and on his fingers and it’s so moisturizing and has a tiny bit on scent to it buts don’t let’s it’s cheapness fool you! One of the best nail products I’ve purchased so far 😍❤️
"
Kathryn Lucas,3.0,2022 29 June,"
This seems to do an adequate job of moisturizing but the glycerides impart a very soapy smell that reminds me of dish detergent. It's also a bit thin and runny. I prefer the CND Solar oil for smell and thickness of oil.

"
Al!xb,3.0,2022 27 January,"
I bought this to push back my cuticles because I recently got into doing my own nails.  The oil is just ok... I wouldn't say it's better or worse that any others you can buy at the drug store. I like that it has a very mild smell . It's oily not sticky, reminds me of hair oil treatment. I wish it was a brush on because you use up more product with the dropper. After the oil drys in like 20 minutes the cuticles go back to being ugly, maybe you have to do it on the regular for the best results ?

"
Purerviolet,5.0,2021 18 June,"
It takes time but it really works. I bought this a month ago. I'm an elderly artist and my cuticles were ragged and dry. At first I didn't see much difference. Then I noticed my skin was peeling off around my cuticles. I almost stopped using it at that point but decided to continue. Now, a month later the peeling has stopped and my cuticles are looking smooth and shiny like never before. So, I started using on my toenails and dry flaky heels. Works there too. It's the combo of the ""milk"" or lactic acid for the peeling of dead skin cells and the ""honey"" which is the moisture.
"
Angela,5.0,2022 31 March,"
Its cuticle oil, it works like it is supposed to but I love the smell!
"
Jason Barnard Brown,3.0,2022 29 March,"
I'm willing to accept the possibility I simply used too much. But I've used other cuticle oils in the same proportions... And most eventually absorb into the skin. This one just sits... Like, until I have to wash it off bc I need me l my hands for something. Smells nice though.

Rebecca Kwasnica,4.0,2021 30 June,"
It's very moisturizing and the scent is lovely and subtle. I only gave it four stars because I personally don't like the dropper, I'm a neat person and it makes the application a little too messy for me. I think I would prefer an oil with a brush next time, otherwise it's a nice cuticle oil!
"

Brandi Gayle ❤,5.0,2020 31 October,"
This is amazing! I have very, very and extremely dry cuticles and this helped them the 1st day but using it 3 times a day for the last week, my cuticles and skin around the sides of my nails where ""I pick"" even have healed. This has been awesome and I'm so glad I discovered this! I have 2 bottles. I'm sure u can get results like me with one use a day. I also do acrylic and gel nails on myself and friends and I use this after I've completed a full set. My friends are even in love with this! Very easy to use! Moisturizes better than other brands and had a very nice scent!
"

"
Starscream5000,5.0,2020 27 November,"
The pandemic has me stressed and I've started the nervous habit of picking at and peeling the skin beside my thumb nails and middle finger nails. After washing my hands multiple times and day and showering, the skin around those nails would become soft and pruny and, once it dried, would be hard like a callous. This started the cycle of me picking at the skin all over again. I bought this cuticle oil and the skin around my nails has improved sooooo much! It's much softer and peeling less so I find I'm not unconsciously picking at it as much as I used to be. This product definitely works!
"
Courtney O,5.0,2021 21 October,"
I have always had suuuuper dry and cracked cuticles. I work with my hands and I’m always embarrassed at how awful my cuticles looked. I pushed my cuticles back, removed them and put this on and my cuticles literally look perfect in ONE day… this might just be my miracle product lol

JD,5.0,2020 24 October,"
First off, I paid for this product with my own funds. Second, I have never written a review for cuticle oil before...but, this oil is so fantastic that I felt compelled to share my opinion. This oil is the best cuticle oil I have ever used. I’m actually quite happy that I don’t have to keep searching for something that works. After using this oil there is a noticeable difference in not only the way my cuticles look but for how long they stay moisturized. I use about three times daily and the results have been wonderful. This will be my holy grail cuticle oil going forward.

Stacia,4.0,2020 17 January,"
I pick at my cuticles A LOT, and have recently made a conscious decision to stop. If my cuticles are at all dry, or a piece is starting to peel off, I HAVE to pick them! I bought this oil in the hopes that they will stay moisturized. I’d say they feel moisturized for about half an hour after I use the product. I have noticed some improvement though. The oil is nice bc it’s moisturizing, but my fingers don’t stay oily like they would if I used baby oil for example. There’s a VERY light smell, which is nice. Sometimes I don’t even smell it at all, which I think I prefer to an overpowering scent. For the price I think it’s a great product.

skatemom,5.0,2021 14 January,"
The scent is mild, which is nice.  It doesn't overwhelm you.  At first, I was a bit clumsy using the ""dropper,"" but with practice, I've gotten better.  And instead of worrying about a little oil getting everywhere, I just rub my hands with the excess.  Like lotions or oils, eventually it soaks in and so, isn't all over everything.  I really love the stuff.  And I think it's going to last me a really long time.  In fact, it may very well outlast ME, period!  :)
"
Kevonna Gardner,5.0,2021 15 June,"
I was kind of afraid to purchase this product, simply because I would normally have my cuticles and nails taken care of at the salon. However since I came home from base I really don’t like going to the salon like I used to, so I tried doing my own nails. Let me just say that I love the way this made my cuticles feel, after I had finished everything. I’m glad that I got a subscription.
"
Wanzi,4.0,2021 14 August,"
This product has really helped me get my hang nails under control. Provides a nice moisture.
"
Sydney,5.0,2021 23 June,"
This oil is for long-term use (there is a lot) and a little goes a long way! The smell is absolutely amazing! Sweet but not overwhelming. I have noticed a difference in my cuticles and they are much easier to maintain when I keep up with them. I also like to rub the oil into the dorsal part of my hands just as an extra touch of moisture. Highly recommend!
"
Stefani P.,4.0,2020 28 June,"
Beautiful bottle, lovely smell but not overpowering, and works great ~ makes your cuticles look and feel smooth, like a professional manicure. One bottle will almost literally last you forever because you need VERY LITTLE with each use. Just touching the tip of the applicator to your cuticle is all that's needed, then rub it in. A tad 'greasy' at first but absorbs quickly as you rub it in. Makes nails look finished, 'polished', professionally done. Would definitely buy again, and for gifting. Recommend!
"
Team Monke,3.0,2021 10 October,"
I really wanted to love this product.  I bought it based on the price point and also the reviews.  I have been using it for over a week, and am disappointed in the moisturizing of it.  I have to put this on multiple times a day to keep my cuticles moist.  The scent and ease of use is a plus, but this product does not do what it advertises.
"
Erin Lucero,4.0,2021 29 April,"
I see no difference in my cuticles, however any type of damage or irrigation I can simply put this miracle oil and by the evening or by the next morning its almost healed depending on the damage. Also the smells is amazing!!
"
Carter,5.0,2022 9 February,"
Great bottle and dropper. Has a nice scent.
"
F Pal,5.0,2022 14 February,"
Easy to use not too greasy
"
MO,5.0,2021 7 August,"
I felt compelled to write this review. I was skeptical at first, my cuticles were really bad and lotion barely helped. I started using this oil and within days I saw the difference-so did by nail stylist. It’s not overly oily and the scent is very light. I will buy again.
"
symone,5.0,2022 20 January,"
Great price for the amount and compared to other brands
"
A M C,2.0,2022 1 June,"
I bought this for my dry, cracking cuticles based on positive reviews. Unfortunately, it doesn’t moisturize my cuticles better than my hand lotion even when I apply and massage into my cuticles every time I wash my hands. I’ve used it for a week, so it was a fair trial in my opinion. Waste of money! I do not recommend this product.
"
Tricia B.,5.0,2021 9 November,"
I love the honey scent. It’s so subtle and smells just like honey. As for the nail oil action, it lasts for about 20 minutes.
"
NIKKI SLICKK ,5.0,2021 23 August,"
A little goes a long way! love the dropper in this! I use it on my elderly clients and I don't need much at all! the bottle lasts a while and smells nice. not super strong or overly perfumed. Will be ordering more!
"
Laura H.,4.0,2020 16 December,"
Overall this has been very helpful with my cuticles after using so much cleaning products and sanitizer at work and every day use after this crazy year 2020.  I felt it was a little slow to start really working but it did help restore and moisturize my fingers and cuticles.
"
Kanikki Callins,5.0,2022 3 February,"
Soft scent great moisture
"
K. Johnson,5.0,2020 7 December,"
I started doing my own nails at home and needed cuticle oil for my cuticles which are dry and brittle from washing dishes. This oil is very moisturizing  and makes my nails look great. I recommend this for anyone that want to care for their nails or who does their nails at home.
"
Sarah J,5.0,2021 1 July,"
I always get hangnails and broken skin around my fingertips. Everyone I know told me to drink more water and it would go away. But now that I have this, I just put some on, rub it in, and then put on hand cream, and my hands look so much better.
"
Jay V ,4.0,2021 28 May,"
I liked that it was moisturizing and easy to use. It had a little scent but not too much.
"
Reichonla Lolly Vashum,4.0,2021 22 July,"
Scent and easy to use
"
RST review,5.0,2020 5 June,"
Nicest nail oil I’ve ever owned. It works great. I use it at night for nails and toes. The scent is mild. After using the oil, I rub it into cuticles and then put lotion on my hands and feet. So the finished process smell is lotion. I’m not avoiding oil smell. It’s mild and doesn’t smell like much of anything to me.I did recommend this product to family and friends who are doing nails now at home. I may give this as stocking stuffer this year.
"
Hannah and Isaac Bocanegra,3.0,2022 12 January,"
Smells great but not as moisturizing/hydrating as I would like it to be, oil seems thin

Chloe Brown,4.0,2021 9 July,"
Works good, smells good
"
amazonshopper115,5.0,2021 14 June,"
The scent is not super strong and a little goes a long way. I love this product and I’ve only used it once so far. I get my nails done professionally but I wanted to make the cuticle part last longer in between visits to the salon.
"
Tina Wise-Cook,5.0,2021 1 November,"
I love this cuticle oil it’s absolutely amazing. Leaves the cuticles nice and moisturized.
"
Ahop ,2.0,2022 2 March,"
The product has a ton of positive reviews, shocking to me!  If you have extremely dry, cracked, bleeding cuticles and need an oil that's going to help, this aint it!!!  My cuticles actually feel drier after using this.Do yourself a favor and just get pure Jojoba oil.The scent is nice, but not if its going to make my cuticles super dry.You've been warned!
"
sheshetta,5.0,2021 7 September,"
This cuticle oil is really good for your hands  it is not greasy. It makes a big difference with my cuticles.
"
star lopez,3.0,2021 10 August,"
It gets the job done. I like that it dries fast and doesn’t leave my hands feeling greasy for too long. The only problem with this is that it darkened my cuticles. Once I stopped using it, cuticles lighted up to their normal shade.
"

"
Lindsay,5.0,2021 10 July,"
My acrylics were pretty harsh on my nails and the skin around them, so i’ve been using this since taking them off. The scent is light and nice and it’s definitely moisturizing.
"
Anastasia B.,4.0,2020 7 June,"
Decent cuticle oil, overall. I was kind of hoping for more of the milk & honey scent, a little disappointing that you really don’t smell much of anything. But the product works fine to soften dry cuticles without being super greasy.
"
Christina’s Channel,5.0,2021 5 January,"
Smells great and feels soft on the skin like a serum would. I would definitely recommend! Turned my toes around quickly. I also placed some on my toes and put socks over my feet and slept in it. Woke up and they looked great! And it smells good!!!!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 6 September,"
This is excellent cuticle oil. I apply it to my fingernails once a week. Thanks
"
Violethearts4791 ,5.0,2021 26 April,"

C.K,5.0,2021 17 January,"
The Cuticle oil has a nice, not too strong scent. It’s very moisturizing and leaves my Cuticles feeling nice! The applicator is a dropper but it’s easy to use but be careful because you might put on a little too much oil on.
"
Kyanna,4.0,2020 18 December,"
Product came 75% full, it was open in the box spilling out. Gave it 4 stars because product is great.
"
Macleod ,4.0,2020 17 January,"
Some product had leaked in the package when I received it and I was annoyed and planned to return but I used it and I’m in love! Best cuticle oil I’ve ever used. Sucks that I only have like half what I ordered because of the leak.
"
Deborah Ryan,5.0,2020 22 July,"
I have always had ragged cuticles & tried soooo many creams & oils.I use on my finger & toe nails before bed. Lightweight so it soaks in without getting on my sheets.Got a mani-pedi today in record time, an hour, usually she spends 15 minutes on my fingernails alone.Try it, you won't regret it.
"
Ellie,5.0,2021 29 May,"

SurfCityGal,5.0,2021 30 April,"
Bought to include in my gel manicure regimen. This oil soothes as it soaks into your cuticles.
"
C.,1.0,2022 18 March,"
I bought this because my cuticles were really dry and at first it seemed to work alright. Temporarily, it made them feel  better. But after putting it on once a day for two months, my cuticles became the worst they've ever been. Dry and crusty and peeling everywhere, which they didn't do before. I thought that it was just my skin, until a friend gave me some Cuccio oil and I used it once or twice and my cuticles immediately looked and felt better. Then I used this one again and they started peeling again. So I don't know if it's some kind of reaction to the oil but my cuticles got worse with use, not better. Could just be me, but I wouldn't buy this again.
"
twihard73,5.0,2021 7 February,"
Its a good product but it could be better. It sits on your hands more than most.  After a few minutes I feel like I need to put more.
"

Very Moisturizing, nice and soft. However, there is absolutely no scent at all :(.

My cuticles very pretty bad as I do my nails my self with glue on nails and this cuticle oil works great ! I recommend
"
Jessica A,3.0,2021 21 April,"
This isn’t the most amazing cuticle oil I’ve ever used and in fact was surprised by how thin it was. I feel like thicker oils moisturize better and longer. This is fine what it is and will get the job done for my weekly self-manis.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 17 December,"
It really works!!! I have dry, hard, and ugly cuticles. I massaged the oil into my nail bed, and it moisturized my cuticles instantly. Now, I can’t stop looking at them.

It’s good.
"
Kelsey,5.0,2020 26 October,"

"
Debi Johnson,5.0,2020 18 October,"
I don't notice a scent. The moisturizing aspect is great because I'm a nurse and wash my hands constantly. Usually by now my cuticles would be bleeding but this has changed my life.
"
Ada Shorr,5.0,2020 31 May,"
I have had a problem with very rough cuticles for a number of years; this product has made that a memory of the past.  Since being unable to go to nail salon during the pandemic, it has been a great help!

This is what my cuticles have been missing! I've tried many other oils and my cuticles would still be dry and noticeable. My manicure would look great but my cuticles...not so much. Now I apply this every day and the difference is amazing. Absorbs quickly and there isn't a strong odor.
"
Agnes Myer,4.0,2020 31 January,"

"
Zach n' Ashley,2.0,2020 29 June,"
I was hopeful to use this product, but this cuticle oil appears to do absolutely nothing.  I know that it is an “oil”, but a lot of cuticle oils aren’t super “oily”.  This one doesn’t absorb into my skin and my cuticles are just as dry as before I put on the oil and leaves my skin very greasy.

J. Gagnon,2.0,2020 19 February,"
OK when I first applied but it dries up within minutesMy cuticles are still extremely dry and peeling.  I have applied it several times a day which is way more than the recommendation and it still doesn’t work

It doesn’t work very well it comes right off it’s too thin
"
mcmughk,1.0,2021 12 January,"
Just some type of oil.  Cannot be applied only to cuticle areas cos the oil is thin and will run over the whole fingers.  Do not feel nourishing the cuticle at all.  Using the argon oil that I have gives me the same result.
"
Broke college student,1.0,2020 3 September,"
I don’t know what’s in this cuticle oil, but the skin around my nails is worse after using it for a week then when I started. It’s hard and dry and peeling and cracking and I wish I’d never used it

This has to be the best cuticle oil I’ve ever purchased. It’s not super oily on you fingers and it smells soooo good!
"
Jackson,5.0,2021 27 April,"
I bought the ‘Milk & Honey’ as well as the ‘Lavender Tea Tree’ cuticle oils. I love that they are easy to apply and very moisturizing! A little goes a LONG way! The Milk & Honey smells really good. The Lavender Tea Tree smells good as well but it definitely has a stronger smell of lemon than Lavender. And the based off the name it says nothing about lemon, so a little misleading with that. But all in all, great products! Will buy again.

douglas crespo,1.0,2020 2 October,"
Just rub vitamin E or olive oil all over your hands. Dont be fooled. Don't put some on your finger and rub in your cuticle. Just keep your hands moisturized and include the whole hand. Cant believe they sell this crap.
"
KentuckyMomma,4.0,2021 3 January,"
I love the smell of the Milk and Honey. It almost reminds me of baby lotion, but in a good way. It is super easy to use and a little goes a long way. I use it after I do a dip powder manicure and the skin around my nails and my cuticles gets pretty roughed up by all the buffing and filing.
"
Jada,5.0,2020 24 September,"
My cuticles were getting pretty dry recently and I couldn’t help but to pick at them. They looked awful. Probably the worst they have ever been. But thanks to this oil my cuticles are A LOT better. I applied it every time my cuticles were looking dry. Approximately twice a day at first. Now I only do about twice a week and they’re still going strong. This is also my natural nail. Highly recommended.
"
Tair Y,4.0,2020 10 August,"

"
Andrea,5.0,2020 31 July,"
This cuticle oil revived my cuticles, nail, and skin around my nails. After the first use, I could immediately notice the improvement. For best results, apply the oil a few minutes after you get out of the shower! Your skin will absorb it quickly and effectively. Your cuticles WILL thank you!
"
Peggy,2.0,2020 11 December,"
It’s too watery. I’ve never used cuticle oil that’s like this. You put it on then it just drips down your fingers before you can run it in. I do NOT recommend.

"
AK,1.0,2021 9 January,"
The bottle is cute and the oil is... fine, but the main issue is the smell. Think less ""Milk & Honey"" and more of a powerful, fake ""Candy"" smell. This was a waste of money for me.

"
Luka Legend,1.0,2021 13 December,"
My cuticles didn’t stop being dry, which was the entire point for me. The oil is really greasy and doesn’t absorb quickly, meaning it gets all over my finger pads and requires more than a quick pass with a tissue or paper towel to get off. Finally, the smell is artificial and too strong - smells like purfume, not a pleasant hint of an aroma.

"
Maylin Williams,5.0,2021 17 August,"
I had a really bad habit of picking at my fingers. I would pick them so bad to where they would bleed. The problem for me was my cuticles were so dry that they would tempt me to pick them all the time. I started using this oil a few times a day and my fingers not only look so much better, I stopped picking at them! It also smells super good. 10/10 recommend if you have this issue.

I loved the packaging, the bottle, the scent, and the ease of use. I’m disappointed that the moisture evaporates so quickly though. I’ll rub this into my nails at bedtime, and within 10 minutes, you can’t tell I put anything on them. I had expected the oil to work throughout the night as I slept, but this isn’t it.

Alberto,5.0,2022 29 August,"
I have been collecting Lego for a while, but hadnt really jumped into tecnic sets. This set is probably the best to get the most of the tecnic experience: the gears, struts, and all other moving components. This set offers a glimpse into the basic function of differentials, gear boxes, 4x4, power transfer, etc.The final product boasts a 4 speed sequential gear-box with a rotary shifter, a DNR shifter, and a Hi-Lo 4-wheel drive shifter, all functional and all on the center console. All 4 wheels obviosuly rotate and are mounted on individual suspension systems. The drive shaft connects to a crude in-line v6 ""engine"" thats made to look like moving pistons. Lego has pieces to make a very nice v6 engine that could potentially fit in this set. This wouldve been absolutely perfect if it came with that engine, but all the other features more than make up for it.I dont care much for the vehicle model, especially because lego are extremely customizable, but the chassis of the model is well worth the price because it has almost everything to make an accurate and functional lego vehicle. I must point out that Tecnic pieces are not great for accurately depicting contours. You will always have gaps on the model. So tecnic is great for depicting functions more than depicting reality and aesthetics. The set does look nice enough for display, but I like it more for play and learning/teaching.I havent gotten around customizing mine yet, but I absolutely want to turn this to RC soon. I know the drive shaft will require some design changes, but the rest of the mechanical parts should work fine
"
WoofWoof,5.0,2022 11 September,"
One of my favorite builds to date although there were moments I wanted to smash it ;)  pay very close attention to the gears. There are many.  I recommend watching the videos for this one by Racingbrick on YouTube. He shows you what to test at each stage of the build as well as common errors. Of course I didn’t have that advice before I built this.  When it was done I found that it wouldn’t roll without a painful grinding sound.  This was because I used the wrong gear in one step. I ended up having  to tear it down and almost start over because of the gear error.  So pay attention. In the end it’s very satisfying and I highly recommend it.
"
PhotoGuyReview,5.0,2022 8 October,"
It’s a great set…I can’t wait to start building this soon to be classic Lego technic set.
"
Oluwatobi,5.0,2022 23 August,"
I gave my 7 Yr old son this as a gift for his 7th birthday after he has successfully completed several Lego Technic models within his age range. He has never Gone beyond 1000+ pcs so we watched online and he got really scared watching an adult build it. When he gathered the courage to start, i was astonished he got it all up within 2 weeks. Now i am searching for a more complex Lego Technic of 9-14 that will be more challenging that the defeder for him. This is a very good buy for its price and the value.

Evelyn Celentano,5.0,2022 24 September,"
It was a gift for my son, I’m sure he is going to enjoy building it.
"
Robertson 23,5.0,2022 23 August,"
First let me say I love Lego’s. That being said this was a really fun build for me. I love all the moving parts and the details of the build. The only thing I wish they would have done was to add motors. I know that would have upped the price but I think it would have been worth it.
"

"
Moira S.,5.0,2022 14 June,"
My son is a lego maniac! He is OBSESSED. I think he is most excited about the tires on this Jeep. This is his most recent set and let me tell you, he underestimated how many pieces it would have. My kitchen table is hidden under them all until he puts it together and he gets distracted, AH-LOT. Did I mention we have 4 cats??? Can't wait to see how this turns out. Hopefully it will not include a vet bill too.

"
Denise,5.0,2022 30 June,"
This is a complex kit, but if you follow the directions (which aren’t always clear) and make sure you use the correct parts ( some a very similar), you will enjoy the time spent and end up with a nice finished product!. I do not recommend it for a beginner, though.
"
Pabloco,5.0,2022 3 June,"
I was looking for a challenging Lego build, and the Land Rover Defender did not disappoint. Its complex gearing was and remains very impressive. It’s a show-piece for sure with loads of movable parts. It has a high play-ability factor too, should I decide to let my daughter play with it. 😉 It’s proving difficult to find my next Technic build after such a great experience with this kit. Super price too.
"
Justin Brought,5.0,2022 27 July,"

"
Tony Piroli,4.0,2022 9 March,"
Well this is one BIG and I do mean BIG lego set and for those who are looking for alot of gears to sync up this is your baby!!!!!  I do enjoy doing LEGO even at 65 I can still enjoy the challenge of attention to detail and what it takes to assemble this project.  Al ot will say the price is high but the amount of time it will take you and just the fun of it is well worth it......
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 27 July,"

James,5.0,2022 16 June,"
Great value and it's very fun to assemble this land rover. It takes me 2 days and commit many hours to finish it. Its size is bigger compare to other lego technic and compose of many features.
"
Joyce Lee,5.0,2021 14 March,"
I’m a huge Lego fan and this set is exactly what I was looking for – hard enough but not too complex, so that I won’t end up messing everything up. I chose this one because of its cool looking, fancy functional features, and most importantly – it’s big enough so I won’t finish it in just one day!All the details specified on the box are real and well functioned, I especially love the gear shift and the hi/lo settings, also the lock door on the back. The real thing looks nothing different from on the box. I was pretty satisfied.If you’re buying this set or if you’re about to build it, I do have a suggestion for you – for every 4 or 5 pages, check if your project is what’s on the book. Especially for bag 1 and 2 when building the engine part, you need to make sure they’re working correctly and smoothly. Unfortunately, it is sometimes hard to tell which gear is which from the book – unlike the bars, there aren’t scales so you can’t know the size, and the colors look almost the same. As a 19-year-old, I still made not only one but a few mistakes during the process, and one fatal that caused my car to not be working correctly. I messed the little gears up, so that’s why I say those are tricky.Overall, I’d definitely recommend this set to all Lego and car lovers! It’s worth it!
"
C. Gollnick,5.0,2022 8 March,"
Given as a gift to my nephew who is an accomplished and experienced Lego builder.  He declared this the most challenging and most fulfilling set he’s ever done.  And that made it especially enjoyable for him.The set I received was absolutely new.  My nephew reported no missing pieces.  The box was in perfect condition… which is important to Lego enthusiasts.  It came in a tight outer box which was then inside of a shipping box, very well-protected.The only problem is how to top this one.

Matt,5.0,2022 29 June,"

"
Marie T,5.0,2022 14 February,"
This was by far the most tedious, brain-scrambling Lego build we’ve done so far. My son is 10 and he tackled this by himself. He got maybe a quarter of the way through and messed something up so we took it all apart and started over again.We finally got it rebuilt and it’s really cool. We bought a light kit from The Kyglaring Store here on Amazon. It’s absolutely amazing makes this build even better.Be prepared to lose your mind a little in this one but it’s so worth it.

"
Saugar,5.0,2020 10 May,"
This was a very fun build — took about 8 hours of total time spread out over several days. The bags are numbered which made working through the set more organized. The functional features are really cool, such as the working gear box, hi/lo settings, drive and reverse lever, working winch, and functional tailgate. The parts are high quality, including the suspension which is quite rugged.There are multiple parts of this build that require a high degree of attention to detail which may be challenging for younger kids. This is officially an 11+ set, but my guess is it would be quite hard of a build for anyone under 16, especially if the challenge is to build it and have all of its functions actually work.As an adult, I still made several mistakes that required me to disassemble some built components to correct. The instructions made it quite clear that certain parts need to be aligned perfectly for the gearbox to work and for the steering to be aligned. I ended up needing to fine tune the gears that controlled the steering as my steering wheel was not aligned to the rotation of the wheels. Sort of like a real Land Rover!Contrary to other reviews, I had no missing pieces.
"
Catraflyr,5.0,2022 14 March,"
Owning a LR and being a lifelong Technic addict, I can say building this kit was a true LR experience, paying close attention to the instructions and details pays off in the end. Excellent for bonding with the next generation and passing down the LR passion and Technic spirit.
"
Jeffrey L Till,5.0,2020 2 April,"
the incredibly detailed Lego Land Rover defender was very fun to build I found it a little hard toward the end of bag 2 when I had to put the to ends of the inner part of the car together. after you've put the wheels on the car it brings the whole thing together. I like how the engine under the hood looks really realistic (putting aside the fact that you wouldn't be able to see the cylinders on a regular car). I wish the inside of the car looked a little less open and techy, but it doesn't really matter. I love how the gearbox really works when you change the shifters. after the 6 hour build, I felt a little disappointed that I was finished because I couldn't build more but I guess that's the falling I always get when finished with a lego. the back door lock does not want to stay locked and closed. I loved this lego a bunch. I was inspired to buy this lego after building the 42096 Porsche 911 racecar. it is very fulfilling. a super awesome design I think you should get it.

"
Keisher P.,5.0,2021 20 September,"
My 9 year old son put this lego set together in 2 1/2 days. He messed up on step 271 because 2 pieces looked identical. He had to disassemble some parts. So, instead of using the booklet to follow instructions he scanned the QR code, downloaded the lego app and followed instructions from there. Because he was able to zoom in on the lego pieces, it made building this very intricate lego set easier.It was not to complicated because he has experience with building lego sets. Overall, It was a fun and amazing experience for my son! He was so proud of the finished product!
"
Michael Correia,5.0,2021 16 September,"
I love this model I built it off and on for about 7 hrs  Go slow and you won’t have hearing problems like some are saying in reviews. Very sturdy only the top roof container comes off during rollovers and you can drop it from about 3 feet and it’ll be fine. Very accurate to the real thing one of the best car models you can get for your money. None of the akward looking holes that some sets (Bugatti) have very natural looking. Can get dirty but as always be careful. Not for kids under 14 needs patience to complete right.
"
BizzyC,5.0,2022 24 January,"
I purchased this for my college age kids and i to build over the holidays.  It had been years since we worked on Legos together and we had a blast.  I was blown away at the quality of this build.  It's a fantastic piece!
"
Sam Kingsley,5.0,2020 8 April,"
I really love Lego that is both fun to build and can be displayed afterward - this one definitely hits both. I'm not the biggest fan of Technic, I prefer the original style of Lego but this was still great.Perfect to work on a bit each night after work and dinner and a really nice way to wind down. The internal functionality of it all was incredible and a lot of fun to see it come together. It was considerably larger than I imagined but that's my fault for not reading the specifications more closely.Once finished it looks awesome on my bookshelf!Tips:- Tweezers really help with sticker application- Pay attention to the color and size of pieces I had a few instances where I used the wrong piece and had to go back a few steps- If it feels like something isn't lining up then you have probably gone wrong somewhere, read back into the book and figure it out methodically
"
Kristin,5.0,2022 4 February,"

Andres,5.0,2022 8 January,"
This is probably the set that give you most for its value. a beautiful design with so many parts at a great price!Some other car sets are much more expensive and don't give you as many parts or functions. Probably one of the best technic sets ever!

This was a truly enjoyable build. I was a little confused when I built the transmission, and it didn't shift as easily as I expected it to. After I tore it down I realized I had just started with the wrong gear. After that it was a very smooth straight forward build. My son-in-law was shocked at the level of detail, and the suspension.

Bought this for my adult son with decades worth of Lego experience.  He absolutely loves it and has it displayed as artwork.

This is the best lego set I have ever seen. It's big, fun to build, and takes quite a while.The mechanics are really neat, although it bugs me that the transmission gears go high to low instead of low to high - probably a gimmicky thing to make it seem like the engine is doing more as you accelerate through the gears, but yeah they have it backwards.The winch is super cool, the truck's look is perfect, and there are a bunch of new parts I haven't seen before. The way it's designed is very sturdy and efficient. Technic sets have come a long way.

My 17 year old son loves to put together Legos and has since he's been 5 - we have about 65 different Lego kits that he's put together over the years. Unfortunately, it's hard to find kits nowadays that are challenging enough for the older ones to put together.  When we saw this one, we knew we had to get it even though the price point was more than we wanted to spend.  It ended up being money well spent since it took him two full days to put together and the details that go into the truck are absolutely amazing and realistic.  It's on display in our family room and my son shows it off to everyone that comes over.

Ok, first off i would like to say that IMO there is no point in the transmissions they give these models. i spin a wheel to see the ""engine"" move and it barely moves because the gearing is so high. rolling it doesn't help. yes i am 41 years of age but Lego has always been my go to when i want to release my mind. works for days or even weeks on end lol and to be honest i bought this model for parts only. i am not a collector, i am a builder and i have things in mind for this set...
"
sean evans,5.0,2022 9 January,"
Definitely not a build for the novice. Once completed it's an awsome piece to display! Being able to see all the gears working, an actual working suspension grabs people's attention.
"
William A. Van Gorden,5.0,2021 8 March,"
I've bottle built a lot of lego sets in the past. This is one of the best auto reproductions they've offered. The hardest and most intricate set I've ever done. If you make the smallest mistake, you're looking at some heart break. You'll have to undo a great deal to fix it. If you want an addition to your Lego garage, you've got to include it. The price is excessive and I imagine it has to do with marketing agreements and not entertainment value. You may have to save up to get it and though the product is fantastic, it bursts your wallet.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 9 January,"
The build was awesome. It’s meant to be a display piece in my opinion - cannot really play without parts falling. But the final word is - AWESOME!
"
Esther lee,5.0,2022 21 February,"
A fun building set... Looking forward to motorized it
"
Julie Tran,4.0,2021 16 March,"
My son spent a lot of time building this.  He was really excited afterwards to play with it. But after one day, a clicking sounded started happening when it was in the gear ""drive"".  We searched all over the internet for solutions.  None of them were helpful to us.  Furthermore, it seemed as though this is a common occurrence with this model.  My son is a HUGE Lego fan, so he still really likes it, but is very disappointed that he can't use the different gears without it making this clicking noise.
"

Gave this to a relative, they loved it. Already out a motor in it as well.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 22 March,"
The box is huge and so is the finished product. Took a good while to build, as one would expect, this one significantly more difficult than say the VW Van or VW Surf Buggy, but looks awesome. Be very careful on which gears you're using when building the engine/transmission as 1 mistake will call for a full rebuild. You know what this product is, nad you know it's quality control is excellent. Buy this, you won't be disappointed.
"
Matt O.,5.0,2021 3 August,"
With other equally complex sets in the $350+ range, this has to be the best value for the money in a Lego Technic set. Its packed with intricate and authentic details and super high quality. Challenging, but an exciting build and unbeatable at $159 for any Lego enthusiast!
"
Nick M. Atalla,5.0,2020 1 July,"
I really enjoyed building this (I'm a retired engineer) and was somewhat sad to finish. Very detailed and functional - not your usual lego set. Many custom pieces which may be a little different from what you're used to with lego, but very enjoyable building. My son and his family have also build similar models during our Covid quarantine. My granddaughter, 7 years old, has proven to be one heck of an builder and probably could have build this one (she is very detailed oriented and pays attention :)
"
Rapheal C.,5.0,2022 10 January,"
Great product great build
"
A. Farfan,4.0,2020 8 May,"
I like the attention to detail. I don’t like the transmission it doesn’t seem to work right when selecting different gears. Also car is not level (back heavy) and the weight creates flat spots on soft tires. This also happened with my new bat mobile from Lego. Lego needs to use thicker sturdier tires for these heavy sets. But overall one of the nicest exterior finishes from technic. It actually looks like a Range Rover n not one of the older technic models that barely have a body on them.
"
Dinesh Garg,3.0,2021 2 July,"
My 5 years old loves building Lego technic models. He wanted to learn how does 4x4 drive works. So we got him Land Rover. It took him 2 weeks to assemble. Once built, as soon as he tried to play with that, pieces started coming from different place. Most notably the back door which comes out all the time.Then he tried to see how does gears work i.e. Hi/Lo/R/N...These look like show pieces only. Even if you keep gear in R, Land Rover will go forward. Also, 4x4 drive is for namesake. When u drive front wheels, engine pistons do not move.This design totally failed on functionalities/expectation.
"
Scott G.,5.0,2020 31 December,"
I bought this for my grandson of seven who with his dad's help assembled the Technic Land Rover Lego.  I saw the finished result at Thanksgiving and it's the real deal!  Amazing what Lego has done with the Technic line.  Now my son wants me to select one so he and his son can build it for me.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 7 August,"
What exited him is a  nice details of car, such as (be aware of spoiler):- gear  that shifting and works properly.- wheels control from the roof- backdoor with possibility open turning a wheel- all those things which are well done, and very likely many other details which I have missed,Nothing was missing or incorrect in the package.4 days of enjoyable building.
"
BallaghMan,3.0,2021 16 May,"
This is an ambitious undertaking for anyone not used to building complex lego models - me!  It’s incredibly intricate, the directions while thorough are not the clearest at times, and unfortunately my set was missing a few key pieces along the way (one can only wonder at the quality control involved in packing these sets).  I also made one or two mistakes assembling the engine gearing which I didn’t realize until way too late.  I was NOT about to disassemble!  Ultimately it was fun in terms of passing several hours of lockdown time over about ten days, but I’d caution novices to start with something a bit easier first (as I should have).
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 30 November,"
Frustration free packaging is them just slapping a shipping label on the LEGO set box which isn’t ideal as a collector or if your deliveries are visible to anyone walking by.Other than that this set is gorgeous and a fun and technical build. There’s a little sadness when you realize there’s only one bag left.
"
EngineerJon,5.0,2021 25 January,"
One of the most fun Lego sets out there. My son is 10 years old and it took him about 8 hours to complete the build. we did experience issues with the engine pistons making a clicking noise as others have mentioned, there is a simple fix on YouTube for it.

OEMDUY,5.0,2020 27 December,"
My son really liked this Lego set. He finished it in 1 and a half days and now he plays with it a lot now. I would really recommend this Lego set for ages 12 and up. Get this for you son or daughter who likes cars. They will like it a lot.
"
Maureen H,5.0,2021 12 June,"
Legos are always pricey, this one is as well, but very fun and simple to assemble, took about a day to build 2,000+ pieces but assembly smooth like butter, fun features, and a good set overall
"
AMM,5.0,2021 26 February,"
Like most LEGO sets, this is not cheap, but it is worth the price relatively speaking. It was a challenging but not frustrating and fun build for my “Expert” son. It is sturdy enough for play, not just display. Technic line is new favorite. Definitely recommend!
"
Yang,5.0,2021 16 January,"
I normally purchase set on LEGO.com, but when I purchased this set, there's a very good coupon on amazon, so I purchased it here, I finished it in 10 days, the building experience is very good, when I finished it, it has a really good look too, I would recommend it.

Quan Li,5.0,2021 24 October,"

"
Yumei,5.0,2021 24 May,"
It's a big, sturdy jeep! My son love it. Took me 15 hours to assemble. One small part was wrong (same color and size but different design), so I found one to replace it.
"
pdx,5.0,2020 1 January,"
I couldn't be ny happier with this kit.  The level of engineering is completely over the top!  Every time I thought a part was missing I eventually found it.  My fingers are numb to the core but the comleted Land Rover Defender made it all worth it.  The funny part is that the build quality of this Lego toy is probably better than that of a real Land Rover.  :)
"
take time t. . .,5.0,2021 23 January,"
LEGO has done it once again with this model.  PERFECT DIRECTIONS. Such complex, intricate parts.  Super cool, fun build.  It's not cheap but it's totally worth it.  I almost want to buy another one just to build it again!
"
young stackz,5.0,2021 6 August,"
It was worth the money and for the price it is definitely worth buying.
"
Constantine Maniakas,5.0,2019 2 December,"
Absolutely an awesome model to build. Every step was easy to execute but...and it’s a big butt...I found that I needed to order missing pieces...twice! I’ve never run into this kind of problem with other models. It was disappointing to have to wait for parts,  but it did allow me to take a break from the fantastic build. I gave it five stars just because it’s a great LEGO set to assemble.
"
dstarr,5.0,2021 24 January,"
This model is fun to build and educational.  The steering, suspension and gearbox all work.  It includes doors and tailgate that open. and a working winch.  It's very clever.  Instructions are very clear.
"
Chuch76,5.0,2021 26 March,"
I absolutely loved this build. 2 late nights with my wife to finish but we’re not pros, plus the wine factor.. Love the attention to detail with the suspension on this model
"
Nick Blake,5.0,2019 13 December,"
Overall it looks great and was great fun to build. However once done I can't get the front wheels to both move in the forward direction. One goes back while the other forward making the tires pop off. I am hesitant to take it apart because I literally would have to take it all apart and rebuild it piece by piece because I don't know where I went wrong.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2020 1 July,"
I just want you to update the real value for the weight, I got the package and the box real weight was 8 pounds, on the product information says 2.2 pounds.This information is important for future purchases.Thanks
"
VH,5.0,2021 17 August,"
Worth the amount paid. Lego Technic is amazing!
"
PNWOwen,5.0,2020 29 April,"
Good lego product, assembly is tedious, taking a few days.I did think it was missing parts, and one of the wheels did not turn, but when we did an audit, we discovered we had made errors in installation. I think its highly unlikely that there are ever any missing parts, but more likely it builders error.
"
Bryan Watson,5.0,2020 3 February,"
I obviously comes with instructions, but is an advanced build. There is no room for error in this build. If you overlook a step or misplace a piece it may screw the whole build up. However, I really enjoyed building with my son. I will be looking for a new project to work on with him soon. He loves the winch feature.
"
YAS,5.0,2021 26 July,"
This was a great build. I loved the gears interaction.
"
Kendall Jones,5.0,2019 23 December,"
It is a really sharp looking set, and faithful to the original design.  I felt like compared to other technic legos we have completed it was not quite as sturdy.  It is made to be more dynamic with shocks and has a great suspension.  That may be the trade off for such a capability. I definitely recommend the set for any Lego Technic fan.
"
Gustavo Villalobos,5.0,2021 21 May,"
Definitely one of the most complete, didactic and realistic LEGOs I've ever owned. The details from the engine, transmission and differentials are outstanding.
"

What a hit.  Gave this to my 10 year old grandson for Christmas.  He likes Lego Technics; this should keep him busy for a while.  There were no lost pieces.  His father said my grandson enjoyed this more than anything in a long time.  Now he needs a new project; wonder what set would be as challenging?

"
johnnycnc,2.0,2021 28 August,"
This should be a wonderful journey to conduct such a great scale model vehicle but LEGO seemed to put a wrong piece of parts (see first 2 snapshots) into the package when I finished over 90% of the assembly. Altough I could still put them together but the imperfection really hurt my feelings by spending 3 days hard work. I don't think that supplier will replace the package for me and I don't want to do the assembly again, either. I just want to wish other purchaser luck not to encounter the same situation like mine. And wish LEGO can further improve their QC process.

"
Rafael,3.0,2020 22 August,"
Please research this set prior to starting the assembly process, there is a glaring mistake in the assembly instructions that will result in performance issues, i.e. the vehicle will make a clicking noise and the wheels will not rotate as intended.With that said: this is a great looking set and wonderful value for the money - but, surely, that's a claim that is both subjective and relative - and that's my two cents.

Nomad,1.0,2020 10 November,"
While this is an amazing set from what I can tell, my set was missing so many pieces that I cannot finish building it.Specifically, in section 4 out of 4 of this build, I noticed the first missing piece. I ordered it in the mail from another supplier. Once it arrived, I noticed a few steps later another piece was missing. Over the course of the next 20 steps, there were 14 pieces missing. I stopped counting after that.Several other reviews stated there were missing pieces. I ignored these reviews, assuming the owners just misplaced pieces, and now I regret it. I was very organized while assembling and am completely confident the error is not mine.I absolutely do not recommend this set.

J. Taylor,1.0,2020 13 May,"
Long time Lego Technic / Creator builder here. I heard from a couple friends that this build while cool is notorious for missing pieces (as you can see from some other reviews). I figured they were outliers and bought it anyways. Got all the way to page 19 or so before a missing piece stopped me (in my case a piece relating to the wheel joint). Now at least a 2-week wait and likely more. I don't know if it was just a bad lot with poor quality control that Amazon got, but it's extremely frustrating.

Jennifer,1.0,2020 2 December,"
I don’t want to open the box because it’s a Christmas present, but the condition of the box is terrible. Based on the packaging, it looks like I bought a used product, which I definitely didn’t want to do, and really didn’t expect—especially based on the price.  I’m worried that all of the pieces won’t be inside. Not even sure how to check, unless I put the whole thing together. Definitely disappointed.

This is another Lego model that will make you completely forget you spent $200.  The main reason being the multiple ways to customize for staging.  With customizable roof rack pieces, multiple opening door/lids and suspension movement you can really make it look different each day.  Plus, the fact is it just looks big and cool.  Assembly was relatively easy with only a small list of confusing manual pages.

This is the second time my son has been midway through his build and found defects in the product. The first time two pieces were missing from the bags, unique pieces that we didn’t have spare or could skip. No we find this piece which is a defect from the factory. Once again Amazon solution is to send entire kit back and rebuild it....🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

This is the best lego kit out. It will be retired sometime soon. The price drop on this set makes it an even better buy. I couldn't recommend it more!

Just started to assemble this lego with my son and so happen that there are pieces missing in the bags.  Unable to assemble it.  Very disappointed with this.  What should I do next throw it away because we can continue the build? Not what i was expecting from Lego at all.

We have spent 12 hours on this to find that the last 2 bags have missing pieces.For $200 their should be a better way to make sure all pieces are there before people put hours into building and now have to stop and wait for a solution. Annoying more than anything.

The Technic Land Rover Defender comes in an impressively large box where the offroad vehicle practically leaps off the front. The value is excellent with over 2,500 pieces easily meeting the $0.10 per piece target builders often use as a comparison point. Upon opening the box, a variety of bags tumble out along with an inner white box which helps give the outer box some reinforcement. More bags and an extremely thick instruction manual lie within the inner box.The bags are sorted into four groups along with a single bag of large rims and tire hubs. The first group is the rear chassis and gear assembly, the second is the front and joins together with the first to essentially complete the inner workings of the car, the third is the rear outer casing, and the fourth group completes the picture with the front of the car and the roof rack. With only four groups of bags, it's a good idea to open a set when you plan to sit down and build a while, or in a place where you can leave pieces out as you build.The first and second bags are easily the more challenging portions of the build. The gear system is remarkably detailed and complicated. I paid extremely close attention the whole way through and took breaks any time I felt myself becoming distracted. The manual is laid out in very easy to follow steps and no steps includes more than a handful of parts to add. Even so, there were moments I found myself studying very carefully indeed to feel confident of what went where. There is a QR code for the page where the front and rear chassis are connected which led to an interesting short video showing the connection. Wonderful idea, but a particular movement the demonstrator made with a gear that is at the end of an axle and then slides backwards as the sections connect actually confused me more than just reading the printed page. All worked out in the end though and love the addition of a video to help out.The third and fourth sections of the car went rapidly and were quite relaxing after the study of the first half. I tested the steering as I went and the doors but left the full test of the gearbox until the end. Risky if something was wrong but it was exciting to wonder how well it was going to work.One hiccup was two nine-page sections of the instruction manual were printed twice and two same-sized sections were missing. I've not had this happen with LEGO before. Happily it was extremely easy to access the PDF online and my building was not interrupted.The finished result is fantastic. The plating covers up some of the incredible detail of the first half of the build but looking through the body and under the hood makes the complexity plenty visible. As for the gears, I felt I mostly got it right: only on one of the many settings did I have any cracking sounds and the others ran smoothly. Completed, the Land Rover is prime LEGO eye candy, no two ways about it. Thoroughly enjoyed this build and if you are up for a good Technic challenge, this should be right in your wheelhouse.

Shelley,4.0,2019 11 November,"
This set is fantastic. The finished vehicle is very large and has so many moving parts it's hard to keep track of it all. It took me somewhere around 10 hours to completely assemble this, and I am an adult builder with many years of LEGO experience. If you are ordering this for a small child, I would strongly recommend planning on helping out with the entire build. I could see many young children having a hard time with this build as there are so many steps and tiny pieces to keep track of.This vehicle has forward, neutral, and reverse gears, steerable front wheels, a four speed transmission, plus high and low gears, 4 wheel independent suspension, etc. There is a lot going on ""under the hood"" of this set.With over 2500 pieces in this set, I guess it's not totally surprising that it was missing a piece. It had extras of other pieces, but not the piece that I needed. Yes, I searched the floors of my work area before docking a star off of the review, but alas, the piece is nowhere to be found and I can only assume that my set was missing this one piece (see photo for the piece that is missing). Aside from the singular missing component, everything needed was included in the box.The manual included with this is something like 500 pages long, so you can see that it is not for the faint of heart. After all is said and done, this is by far the most advanced LEGO set I have ever built, but what a blast it was building it. This would be a great parent and child project, but if you just set your 5 year old loose on this set I wouldn't expect to have the best of results.

I think my 5-year-old son and I have been working on this for a good 1.5 months now. It's going slower than I had anticipated but I'm OK with that because I get to spend more quality time with my son, and because it's great learning tool for him-—his math and counting skills have improved, he has to visual pieces in 3D space, and he has to troubleshoot when things go awry.The LEGO instructions are hands down the best instructions I have ever seen and I guess this is why I was initially frustrated with how slowly our build is going. We also have a three-year-old Godzilla running around our house who likes to smash what we have built so that hasn't helped us. However, we have turned this into a learning experience for our 5-year-old. When stuff gets knocked apart we sit down and put our thinking caps on—I tell my son we are the repair crew in charge of fixing everything. First, we try and figure out what pieces we already have together by comparing the part we are working on to what is in the manual, and then we look for what's missing—what color is the piece we need, what shape is it, and if its a brick how many units wide and long is it, and then finally how do we put everything back together? I LOVE when my son says ""Ah, I get it!"".When I was younger my brothers and I had buckets and buckets of LEGOS that we played with endlessly. I think next to Matchbox cars LEGOs are really the only toy that I vividly remember playing with. Our mom would take us to K-Mart every year to see the giant LEGO creations they had on display at the entrance and we would get so excited.One day we will get this build completed and finally post our picture!By the way, do yourself a favor and download the ""Lego Life"" app for your phone. As soon as you open your LEGO set scan the QR code in the manual and add the set to your library. This way when the instruction book gets shredded or lost like ours always do you will have it on your phone.

 I’m going to say right off that I’m a huge LEGO fan. I’ve been one for 20 years and I’m most likely going to be one for the next 20 if my luck holds. I’ve built with generic LEGO blocks and I’ve built in their themed sets such as Star Wars and Harry Potter. Their Architecture sets and City builds are some of my favorites but this Land Rover build in their Technic series tops them all. The level of detail is astounding. I have one niggle as I always do but otherwise this review is positive...please get rid of the stickers! Honestly, a handful of branded pieces can’t be that hard. Ok...on to the build review.This is a challenging set. The beginning age range of 11 years old is going to need a little help. A 13 year old could probably swing it but it’s still going to be building on a minute detail scale. The parts bags are a bit jumbled so you’ll need to open all the little bags inside the larger bags at the start of each section. The bags are labeled in build sections 1 through 4. Inside those bags are even more bags of tiny parts and you’ll need some from each from the start. This means opening 4 to 6 large bags of parts plus 3 or more tiny bags PER section. I used plastic bowls for the smaller parts and plastic plates for the larger ones. This helped keep things sorted. I’d recommend only opening one sections components at a time.The manual is huge and at points it’s clear...as mud! The work around is the app! Install it on your tablet or PC, scan the QR code and download your manual. Being able to zoom it in and out is a game changer and a huge improvement on the folded over pages that never stay flat enough to read. How many times has the manual swept parts off the table during your builds?  Or is that just me? Anyway, the app is a win win!As the build progresses and you realize you’re being taken through the building of a Land Rover from the engine and drive shaft all the way out to the roof rack and tires...the scale begins to dawn on you. From the working pistons to the coiled spring shocks , the detail and commitment to design is apparent. One of my favorite components outside of the intricately built front wheel drive is the large scale real rubber tires. This set is quality through and through.If you are a Land Rover enthusiast, an automobile buff or just a huge LEGO fan, don’t pass this one up. This isn’t style over substance folks, this is model building with LEGO at the top of their craft!

Tiger,5.0,2019 29 October,"
It's always an AWESOME day when there's a big box of LEGO waiting for me!  The box has great images of the set and has the Land Rover displayed against a rocky background, which is perfect.  Box opened, here's what we have: a bunch of bags of LEGO, manual, sticker sheet, and 5 ginormous tires!  This set is really cool and a lot of fun to build.  My husband was really into LEGO vehicles when he was a kid, so he's building this one first.  Once he's done, we'll tear it apart and I'll build it again.The set contains a hefty instruction manual in a single volume that measures nearly three quarters of an inch thick - close to 500 pages! The first 2 pages of the instruction manual have information about how to get the LEGO Life app and how to make sure you're choosing the right size piece  Then it's straight into the instructions.  The instructions themselves, in usual LEGO style, are all pictures and symbols.  The manual also has a QR code so you can add it to your sets in the free Lego Life app, and access PDF instructions that you can download or read on your tablet or other device.All told, there are 21 bags of LEGO divided into 4 numbered groups and one unnumbered bag.  Within some of the bags are smaller bags, usually containing smaller parts.  In most of the sets I've done, there are usually 1-3 bags in each numbered group, but this set is unique, so here's how they break down.  Group 1 has 3 bags.  Group 2 has 7 bags.  Group 3 has 5 bags.  Group 4 has 5 bags.  There's also one unnumbered bag, that contains the wheels and fender parts.When you build it, the instructions will have you build using the pieces from the bags labeled ""1"", then once those bags are completed, continue with the pieces from the bags labeled ""2"", and so on.  I've found that it's useful to open all of the bags for the particular number, but keep the pieces a little bit separate.  The pieces aren't randomly distributed between bags - instead, all of the pieces of a particular type may be in one or two bags, so if you dump the bags out and keep the pieces slightly separate, once you've found which pile your piece is in, you may find the rest of them in that same pile or in that one and one other.  This is particularly useful in a set with so many bags per numbered group, because otherwise you will be sifting through quite a lot of pieces to find what you're looking for.Another tip that I find helpful with the larger sets, or anytime I may be doing the build over several sessions, is to use shallow flat containers to separate the contents of the bags, one container per bag.  I got a bunch of fabric-covered lidded bins for organizing my sweaters, but I didn't want to use the lids, so I repurposed them for sorting LEGO or puzzle pieces, and they work perfectly!  They stack pretty well (good if you're short on space or don't want to wander all over to reach what you need) and they allow me to tidy my project in minutes, to continue later, or to move it to another location.  Having some sort of sorting trays can be really useful for the larger sets.Because there are a lot of pieces, if you plan on taking it apart and rebuilding it, a tip: sort the pieces by types.  I usually do something along the lines of ""windows and doors"", ""big plates"", ""tiny pieces"", color groups for pieces for which there are a reasonably large number of pieces, ""random"" for the pieces that don't really have a classification, and so on.  I sort them in stackable trays so I can move them around as needed.  Choose trays that are one color (easier to find pieces against a simple background) and not the same color as your more popular pieces (black pieces on black background are really hard to see).The set does not contain any minifigures because it is not to minifigure scale.  The car is 8 inches high, 16 inches long, and 7 inches wide.  What's pretty neat is there are some special elements new for October 2019, including a new transmission system, which is the most advanced Technic gearbox yet.  There are also cool interactive features in the car - check out the last few pages in the manual to see what fun things it can do.I really like this set.  It's great for any LEGO, LEGO Technic, Land Rover, or classic car fan.  I love the larger sets, so anything with this many pieces is fantastic.  Keep in mind that because of the large piece count and some potentially challenging build techniques, the age suggestion for this set is 11+.  I've found that children younger than this age who are especially skilled at LEGO can enjoy this also, and it can be a great activity for parent and child to share.  It's also great for adults who love LEGO, and want a bigger challenge.

A. Antonio,4.0,2019 17 October,"
First of all, this one is a marvel of engineering.  It's a very complex build with a ton of moving parts.  I believe that's one of the reasons why this one ends up being somewhat annoying.The first big issue - the kit was missing two pieces, but had and extra dozen or so parts.  Maybe I'm just not that good at building these and missed something along the way, but that seemed like a lot of extra parts.Both of the missing parts were in group four of the build and ended up being cosmetic.  Still you paying a big price for this kit.  Any missing parts is really annoying.I wish there was some testing built into instructions.  After I finished the entire kit, I found out that I must have made a mistake in 1st section.  The rear wheels do not turn correctly.  There is a clicking sound.  If testing was built into the instructions, that would have been caught.  Now I have two choices, live with it or spend about 14 hours stripping and rebuilding.Despite the high price and annoying aspects of this kit, it's still amazing to see it function.

I am nothing but impressed with this LEGO TECHNIC LAND ROVER DEFENDER set.It's awesome.First things first, this is a large set. It has 2,573 pieces. Once built, the DEFENDER is about 16"" long, about 8"" high and about 8"" long. This makes up a substantial set.Most impressive in this set is the incredible detail. The moving parts are many and exacting to the actual vehicle. The doors open, of course, but there's so much more. The hood (bonnet!) raises and gives you access to a very life-like engine which includes moving pistons. There's a working winch and the transmission even works it's gears! It's fantastic!( This cool transmission, according to Lego: the New-for-October-2019 transmission system with 2 levers for engaging high or low gear ratios and a selector for changing gear – the most sophisticated LEGO® Technic™ gearbox to date.)This is a detailed and ""harder"" build. Any kid will likely need an adult to help - the directions are great, as with all Lego sets, but they're detailed and long. That being said, this is a great kit for anyone, including any adult - even someone not into Lego who is into automobiles!Once built ... well, it's gorgeous, with official Land Rover decals that supply an authentic look. I truly want to display mine!I would suggest that any Lego collector utilize BrickSet dot com to catalog and track their Lego collection. It's free and a wealth of information.All In All - This Is A Highly Recommended Set! Super Fun. Lots Of Bricks. VERY DETAILED.

BurazeKun,4.0,2020 21 July,"
First, this is a great kit, with functional parts! This excites me, however, I had to barrow parts as some were missing in my kit. Especially the elastic bands. Nothing you could see externally, and honestly there are a lot of parts. I didn't have much time to work on it, so it took me months before I could get started, and about a month to finish, working about 3 hours a week, so about 12 - 15 hours working with my 6 year old son. I may have been able to finish it quicker with my 11 year old son, but he wasn't interested in my lego project. I love it now that it is finished, but I remember the frustration of trying to find missing parts thinking I just misplaced them. I personally never had an issue with missing parts, often getting extras in the end. Not the case here, as I did get extras, just not what I needed.

Hubba Bubba,4.0,2019 31 October,"
My 19yr LEGO fan decided to tackle this & put it together.  He did this over 2 long days after school & homework.  This has the standard LEGO picture instructions book.  Sometimes these are not the easiest to follow & you end up undoing & redoing a few steps.This book has 494 pages.  The last step # 480 is on page 489.  There was an assembly issue with our booklet as it is missing pages 31 through 51.  Also pages 47 - 61 were repeated.  I am SOO glad that LEGO posts full instructions in PDF on their website, just search by the kit # to find them & download.If it was not for that to get the missing pages online, we would have had to return this instead of complete this amazing set.He really likes this set & really enjoyed the challenge of putting this together.

Wow, this Lego set is no joke.  My jaw dropped when the mailman delivered this thing; the box is massive!  With over 2,500 pieces, there is a tremendous amount of build-potential.  The land rover build itself is amazing; fabulous design and it has a multitude of moving pieces.  The details to the engine, gearbox, and all-wheel-drive is just wicked cool.  I did not get this kit because I wanted to display the Land Rover, I got it because I wanted a lot of pieces that I could cannibalize for other Lego builds.  If you need a bunch of various pieces, getting them by buying a set is the way-to-go.  It's a great build, and if you're unfamiliar with some of the more advanced techniques when it comes to TECHNIC builds, this is a great set for you.  The age requirement for this set is for patience.  We had no missing pieces and it took about 13 hours to build with the ""help"" of my son.  The pieces are broken out into numbered packets which makes organizing your build a bit easier.  If you are truly into the Land Rover, you can even buy an LED light kit for it.If you have any questions about the land rover, just ask in the comments and I'll do my best to respond promptly.

Scarlett,5.0,2019 11 December,"
I got this for my 11 year old who has surpassed regular Lego sets and wanted something more advanced. He’s into building, designing 3D printed things, and figuring out how stuff works so this was a good fit. The first thing I noticed about the Land Rover Defender was the weight. This is a heavy Lego set, which is to be expected with 2,500 pieces and actual working, moving parts. Once you open the box you are greeted with sorted, bagged parts. Tell your child ahead of time not to rip open the bags and dump all the pieces into a pile. They are divided into:Front endRear casingRoof rack/frontRims and tire hubsRear chassis/gearsThe manual breaks down assembly into small chunks of steps, but depending on your or your child's ability you may need help with the gears. They are very complex to assemble. The rest of the steps are easier than the gearbox and feel more like building a traditional Lego set. What’s cool is that if you have a phone you can scan a code and it takes you to a video showing you how to do certain assemblies.It looks awesome when it’s done, incredibly detailed and seeing the inner workings is really cool. It’s great hands-on learning.

 This kit is a mechanical marvel! I’ve been building with Legos since I can remember back in the mid 1960’s.  This model build was beyond anything I hade ever built. My daughter (12) who is a very advanced builder in her own right, started the build but got lost around step 235. She moved on to build the Hogwarts Castle 71043 set(over 6000 pieces). I had to take it apart back to the first step and rebuild it.  The Land Rover directions are very involved and I actually found it very relaxing to work on after along days work. It took several nights and more than once I got caught up in building after the rest of my family had gone to bed.The attention to detail is amazing. Several times I just had to keep  building, not really knowing how it would all fit together. The photo of the finished bottom of the model describes it best. It is a marvel to watch the pistons on the engine go up and down as the wheels are rotated. The gear range selector, forward/neutral/reverse selector and gear shift “dial”, all work flawlessly. The steering is awesome with its rack and pinion gear meshing as they are turned by the wheel or the roof top knob. Even the winch works!If you are a fan of Land Rovers or just cool stuff, this is a great set. Very happy with the results.

Ladybug,5.0,2019 20 November,"
This took us a while to build, but the finished product is so cool! The set says 11+. My 10-year old is great at LEGOs, so we let him start the set. I’ll be honest, he got bored about halfway through, but he was able to follow the directions just fine. My husband took over and finished it.According to both of them, the instructions are clear and easy to follow. The set was missing one piece, but we had another LEGO that could substitute for it. And the finished Jeep is really cool, with pieces that work and move together the way a real car engine would.The only negative is that the pieces are a bit harder to snap together. We’ve experienced this with other LEGO Technic sets too. It’s just the way they are. So a little kid may have trouble putting this one together on his/her own. But this is a minor annoyance in my book. Overall we are extremely happy with the building process and with how the Jeep turned out.

KrisTK,5.0,2020 19 January,"
My 12-yo son really wanted this for Christmas after he saw it in the Lego catalog. I ordered it from Lego to get the VIP points to use for the next one he wants ;).The box is impressive. It took him about a week of Christmas break to assemble it, with breaks of course. He was so excited with each step, demonstrating the gear shifts it did and how the suspension worked and then the steering. The pistons moved with the wheels. He hooked it up to a small Lego motor to demonstrate and then to see how fast it would “run” (just the pistons and shaft with gear shifts).He finally finished the body and ran it around over bumps in the house. Various bits came loose with handling, but I expected that. He spent time diagnosing why the pistons changed their pattern and found another loosened part.Overall, excellent build. Not very tight but expected. Challenging for a kid. He is anxiously waiting for the motor kit, although the light kit looks pretty cool. May get the grand tour car next.

Samantha,5.0,2019 20 November,"
Just a heads up this build may take you at least 8 hours. It's challenging but worth it in the end!  It's not perfect and there are some challenges.Upon completion I noticed that the gear box system is finicky and of course if you mess it up you literally have to rebuild the whole thing. When you do get it working you may be disappointed because it's not worth al the hype.The ""motor"" isn't the greatest in terms of the functionality. For example, the linkages which have the bend-ability are very weak / flimsy so the motor doesn't run as it should. In my opinion the actual drivetrain should have a different type of linkage.. maybe something straighter to avoid this issue altogether.Other than that, this thing is top notch in terms of aesthetics.  Very realistic. Impressive that all the parts work. For example, the double steering mechanism, suspension, steering wheel, doors, and even the doors able the lock the back door.

Nerdy Narwhal,5.0,2019 1 November,"
I have never build a Lego Technic set before this month.  The car carrier was my first set, and this is my second.  The number of pieces in this kit is amazing and there are a lot of moving and functional parts that act like the real vehicle does.I would call this set somewhere between intermediate and advanced as far as building skills go.If you are like me and need to sort and organize all of your pieces before building, you are going to need to set aside a good chunk of space while you sort and organize your parts.  I wound up using some craft divider totes for holding a bunch of the parts so that they didn't get mixed up again.  (Personally I find the sorting to be the most fun part of building lego sets, but I know that I am an odd duck.)

Our home is a huge fan of legos. We love a good challenge and this one brings it! My husband has been working on this with our kids for a while and they have had so much fun methodically putting this thing together. The detail is absolutely incredible, as well as the engineering with all the moving parts! This is so cool and definitely one of our best builds.Lego did an amazing job keeping everything in sections and outlining the directions on how to do it. There is NO RUSH to build this. This is a project! Once completed it's so satisfying and beautiful!  What a fantastic gift for any young builder or a project to just tinker with. I'm floored by the quality of this set. We love you LEGO! Keep making amazing sets like this!

Living it Up!,5.0,2020 22 April,"
I am a 60-something grandma who still loves her Legos.Retirement and covid have created lots of Lego building opportunities.This Land Rover is my first Technics build in decades, and I LOVED IT!!!The finished product is beautiful and you will feel proud of your accomplishment if you were patient and thorough and got every single step correct.It was a good, focused build.I do have trouble sometimes with the way various neutral colored tiles are portrayed in the printed instructions, and I wish Lego would do a better job with color accuracy in matching the colors of actual pieces and making clear distinctions between similar neutrals.  I did use the lego app a couple of times to figure out pieces.You do NOT want to have to take this apart to trace a mistake. Nope, you really do not.I have a few Technics sets in my cart now deciding on my next project

Andrew K.,3.0,2021 14 August,"
I purchased this from Costco back at Christmas from Costco, the model is cool and great to build but it is the gearing that gets me.  So first off this is a great pooking model and definitely enjoyed building it, it worked great once complete but after a few months the gears are skipping.  I have since taken it back apart to see if I can figure out where the main issue is occurring.  In high it operates just fine but when in low, while pushing it, you can see the valves struggle to keep up and skip after more than pushing further than a foot.  The valve rods you can see stop then all of a sudden catch up really fast, the way Lego did the gearing is poor.  I feel like I can say rgus as I had one of the first year boxed Lego vehicles, I placed it on my dad's treadmill at 10 MPH while in first year, not once did the gears slip but instead it started shredding the tires and twisting the main axle.  I was a young teen at this point and figured such might happen but still NO GEAR SKIPPED.  I am now an engineer and kbow much more about gearing, once I jave the chance to figure out why this happened I will report back but for now I am dissatisfied with this model.

D. Michael Elkins,5.0,2019 5 November,"
When there's 489 pages of instructions, you know that you're in for hours of work assembling this vehicle.  And yes, it did take me over three weeks or so working an hour or two every few days but it was well worth the effort.  So many gears and moving parts and such detail.  Plenty of decals too. Even the shock absorbers work.  Sadly I was missing a couple of pieces, one of which was required to attach the headrest to the front seat passenger's seat but I should be able to order a replacement piece and the other missing pieces weren't as essential.  Of course, there were a number of extra pieces supplied, just not the ones that I needed!  All in all, this is probably the most impressive Lego construction project that I've worked with since the Statute of Liberty.

This is a very heavy set, the box comes almost up to my knee high. Intended age is 11+, perfect for my god son who is 11 this year.With over 2500 pieces, this set will take a while to build, so I’m holding off until the holidays when we have more time to build this over a weekend. I’ve done a similar LEGO building project with my god son and god daughter over the summer and they both loved it. It gets the kids away from their iPads and video games for a while, making them use motor skills and problem solving skills.This is great for kids who likes to put thing together. Will update with pictures in a few weeks when we’re ready to tackle this project.

Zeldie Stuart,5.0,2020 25 July,"
Overall amazing with very complex mechanisms...engineered to perfection but may be too difficult  for younger children.  Requires much attention to detail.  If you are a lego afficiando (like me) this set will keep you occupied and very happy.  A special gift I highly recommend to a lego lover.  (I received it from my grandparents for my 14th bday) Took me 7 hours (I am a pro lego builder)  4 hours one day, 3 hours the next.  It is a gorgeous car and fabulous to build and then to look at with all the special features.  I will make it remote control so it actually moves.

MrE,5.0,2020 10 June,"
I feel like Technic has been knocking it out of the park lately with their sets -- they are fun to build, they are looking more complete/better and the functionality of the model works better as well (some of the older bigger sets had issues with flexing and such).The Land Rover looks great, lots of fun little features, it steers, roof rack is removable/customizable, goes up and down, etc.  The engine even moves with the wheels -- which is fairly common in technic but they changed up the design a bit for this, and it's pretty cool.
"
Gail Rodgers,5.0,2019 5 December,"
This is one huge and awesome kit! Over 2500 pieces and if you look at the picture, instead of all sorts of other things to make, the Land-rover is pretty much it. Instead of just making the outside of the vehicle, with this set the user ends up building the inner parts of it as well. This would be a great and I assume a long term project for a Lego lover as well a car enthusiast. I would so much rather see kids making up this set then planting themselves in front of the TV or a computer game.Thank you for the opportunity to review this great Lego product.

EVERY SINGLE PART HAS MISSING PIECES!!!I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!
"
teeinep,5.0,2019 20 October,"
It has many parts and it requires skill.  This is a great father/son project.  I ordered for my nephew but he needed help from his dad to complete the project.  The model is realistic and fun, great gift for sharing time with the kids or gift it to an adult who is a fan of the brand.  Impressive to build and impressive results; my little nephew needed guidance but he felt a sense of accomplishment when done.
"
Lemon,5.0,2019 25 October,"
I really enjoyed Legos as a kid, and have been giving them as a gift to the kids in my life. But this set caught my eye to personally assemble, as I am a big fan of the Land Rover Defender, so I decided to re-emerse myself in Legoland.  This is a huge set that comes in a suprisingly large box. It is intricate and very detailed, and a lot of fun. The Defender is impressive, was fun to assemble, and now looks great on the shelf.
"
Andrew S. Kirmayer,5.0,2020 1 August,"
This model is amazing! It's even harder than the giant excavator (with even the light kit). I had to do the first part over; made too many mistakes with post alignment and gears, so it seemed a do-over was the right thing. Now I've gone beyond that. My advice is to pay attention to every last detail in the instructions and watch out for parts hiding inside others. But this is most definitely a project. Just trying to take it all in before it's finished!
"
CHISA UENO,5.0,2020 28 December,"
My 8year old son would like to this for a Christmas present 🎁 and he really enjoyed to make it!!
"
SciFiChick,5.0,2019 20 November,"
This was a very impressive and fun set to put together. The amount of detail and level of difficulty was a good challenge and took a while. It's probably the most complex build I've done yet. And it's much larger than any other vehicle I've assembled. This will definitely be on display, but there are plenty of working parts that are fun to show off.
"
Mrs. Simpkins,5.0,2020 6 November,"
Great LEGO set. The Techno selection is a great development from the traditional LEGO systems. The jeep itself looks realistic, and all the parts and pieces were a great addition
"
Angelia Vernon Menchan,5.0,2019 8 October,"
I’m the biggest LEGO advocate ever. They provide hours of fun, thought and dexterity are needed. This Truck is no exception. More than 2500 pieces. So lay out a mat, get little containers for the pieces and create... I mean, let the kiddies create 🤣 perfect gift for those who love trucks and putting things together.
"
Andrew L,5.0,2019 3 November,"
This LEGO set is amazing! As with all LEGO sets, the quality is there as well as the attention to detail. This was very fun to put together with the help of my kids. Good family time and working on engineering skills.
"
JN,5.0,2019 15 October,"
If you are fan of lego car set, you cant miss this. It look so real to me after complete. I can even open the door, roll the car back and forth. It will take a little time to read the instruction and built it, but it worths.
"

Lauren Sanchez,2.0,2022 21 January,"
This would hav a been a great build if it wasn’t missing pieces. The worst part is I didn’t realize things were missing till I was over halfway done. This was beyond frustrating and very disappointing, you think for a $200 Lego set everything would be here.
"
John T. Horner,5.0,2019 10 October,"
This is a big kit which took a very experienced builder about 11 hours to assemble. The final result is stunning in the build was very satisfying. one piece was missing, but Lego sent a replacement parts straight away.this is a great set for the really serious Lego fan. note that it is a Technic style build which is a little different from conventional Lego kits.
"
Morgan Lea Lamb,1.0,2021 19 November,"
I expected a brand new Lego Technic Land Rover Defender (42110).  This is a gift for my husband.  While I have not opened the Lego box as this is for Christmas, the box itself has been previously opened and both ends taped shut with wear on the corners and denting from wear opened.  Other sets I purchased directly from Lego all were glued shut with no wear on the corners of the boxes.  I anticipate this being used.  I will give a follow-up review once this has been opened to see if the bags were torn or not.
"
Dave dives deep,3.0,2021 18 January,"
Really enjoyed building this but upon completion the rear end sags. I have tried everything I can think of except undoing 10 hours worth of work to replace the rear shocks. I'm actually considering returning it -assembled.
"
Courtney Haine,1.0,2020 6 December,"
This is the first time I rage quit a Lego kit. I bought this at Costco for my son. After we completed the running gear and tried to test out the transmission and transfer case we experienced severe driveline binding and cracking. We tore down and rebuilt the entire thing twice, double checking every step, and still the driveline binds to the point of gears skipping and wheels locking up. It’s not just us either. There are many videos on YouTube about issues with this kit.
"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2020 9 August,"
Rear end sags! Had to switch shocks from another set, lots of gears shafts and levers for nothing I feel. Who approved this set?

"
yyz,5.0,2021 26 February,"
What a great model.  My 12 year old loves complicated gear constructions.  This kit is full of them.  The three main parts under the body, front, middle, and aft are like 3 mechanical watches.  I let the little guy build all of that.  The second half of the kit is the body.  He was bored to death, so I built the rest.  Typical Lego quality and fun.  Sturdy.  Of the parts I was 'allowed' to build, the door hinges were way cool.This drivetrain is complicated.  Next, we are going to motorize it.  Motorizing the steering will be super simple, but I expect to spend hours figuring out how best to tie into the drivetrain.  Love it.
"
Andrew V.,5.0,2020 9 November,"
Amazing design and really fun build! Crazy the intricacies they have for moving parts on this build! Great cost and amount of pcs for the cost, too. Def recommend. Not even a fan of the vehicle specifically but one of my favorite builds yet
"

I just loved building this set! End product is amazing and much bigger than expected. One problem though is that I cannot get the pistons to move. I know I did something wrong and it is not LEGOs fault! Good amount of stickers and no missing pieces!! 100% worth it!
"
G.,5.0,2021 16 January,"

kyleh,5.0,2021 23 November,"
I loved Legos in my youth and I’ve recently decided to pick them back up.This was my first Lego purchase in many years and it was a terrific first choice.There was not a single piece missing!Total assemble time was spread over 4 days with about 3 hours session each for a total of 12 hours to assemble.The instructions are extremely clear, as they should be and I had a blast the entire time listening to podcasts while assembling.  I would say the difficulty level was medium.It’s quite cathartic assembling Lego’s!I’m already eyeballing my next one as this one will find a nice new home on my collectors shelf.
"
Jesse J Brockmann,5.0,2022 21 July,"
This was a very fun but long build.  Being Lego it can be a bit fragile so handle with care.  I added a motorized kit to make it remote controlled and it was a blast.
"
Lonestar,5.0,2021 27 October,"
Loved this LandRover lego model , I would definitely buy this again
"
R. Kirby,5.0,2022 14 May,"
This was a pretty challenging build.  I wouldn't say it was as hard as the Bugatti Chiron that I built previously, but definitely harder than the DB5, Ecto-1, and Back to the Future Delorean builds I've also done recently.It actually feels pretty sturdy.  I feel like I could let my 5 year old nephew play around with it and he wouldn't destroy it (unlike the Ferrari 488 set).The top steering makes it a little more useful to play around with.  Other vehicles like the Chiron and Ferrari have functional steering wheels, but you can't turn them and move the car at the same time unless you are very talented (I am not).I didn't like the winch.  Too hard to use and retract.  I'm not a sticker fan, but this set only had a few.Overall, I recommend it.

There were no missing parts for us but we did find some parts had worked their way inside others.  It's just a matter of patience!  Will be getting him another model to keep him busy during the shut down!

Este set es más que excelente. Primero que nada es uno de los sets con un gran número de piezas que son una maravilla de ingeniería, no se ven y es de lo mejor. El manual tiene un aproximado de 860 pasos, por lo que sugiero en el ensamble se haga con mucho, pero mucho cuidado, cualquier descuido podría llevarte a desarmar un gran avance. La calidad de las calcomanías es de lo mejor.Para el armado del ""gearbox"" es realizarlo con una delicadeza y asegurarte que todo, pero todo este perfectamente ensamblado, sin espacios, todo prácticamente a la medida ya que al no hacerlo, el set puede presentar un ruido molesto al usarlo en el ""gearbox"". Sus funciones, aunque manuales, son una maravilla. Si quieres tener una mejor idea de lo que hablo y no te animas a comprarlo, observa el review de ""Sariel"" en Youtube, para que te des una mejor idea de lo que este set es.

3 real land rovers and one Lego. Great Lego car. Built 2 and one i sold it. Very complicated kit comparing it with e.g. mustang, beetle, mini, db5. It has a working gearbox, differentials, suspension, winch and the list goes on and on and almost 500 pages of instructions. You must be very careful not to forget any step or any piece behind. There is a clicking noise when having forward gear but other than that I could easily built a third if i had the chance, just for the fun of it.  And anyway, its a land rover, its not meant to work properly all the time..... :)

This is a great kit.  I am half way through the build and the quality, as usual for Lego, is excellent

Be sure to get the Thermacell canisters for these refills.  Works super well.  No smell, easy and effective.
"
Clara ,5.0,2022 4 October,"
This product is amazing and it's worth the money.  I've been using it for a little over a year and I have 2 for my yard. No mosquitoes while we're outside enjoying the pool.

They are convenient and work but need frequent changing and it gets expensive to say nothing about the plastic waste

Colleen Peterson,5.0,2022 2 August,"
We've been travelling in our 25' travel trailer for the past 2 months and found that there wasn't space for our drinks nks in the RV fridge.  Due to this, we looked into electric coolers and portable refrigerators, and found we wanted a refrigerator.  This is because it cools to the point of refrigeration but does not run constantly.This Bodega fridge cools very quickly, holds up to larger size bottles (think 2 liters or wine bottles) and has a large capacity.  For the price point it was a great deal as it has both the cigarette lighter adapter as well as the 12 volt.  We take it in the truck with us when not camping.  We've been using it nonstop for a month with no problemsHighly recommend and would purchase again.

I love these. They don’t last super long and are kinda pricey IMO but they do work. Mosquitos love me and these keep them off!

This product worked as it was advertised to work. A bit pricey compared to sprays but more effective in my opinion.

Princesssss,5.0,2022 12 September,"
I live near a pond so I get a few more mosquitoes than typical. I used this the whole summer and recall 2 mosquito bites. Really great but expensive product.
"
Gina Lee,5.0,2022 7 September,"
I bought these to go along with the lamp. It works. I mean it REALLY works. Mosquitoes hate it. We have been using it all summer on our patio and even on evening walks. Totally recommend!

Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 21 September,"
No mosquitos in the Georgia woods during hunting season. Doesn’t affect deer either.
"
Darkzero,5.0,2022 6 September,"
Pro: works well, pads are easy to use.Con: remove pads after use, while machine cools, pads are still warmed and run out faster.

Rose G.,5.0,2022 31 August,"
It can be a tiny bit challenging to get the hang of turning it on. Once past the learning curve it’s protection!!!

Been using these for years and now can use for just an evening in the back yard.  I will keep buying.
"
H. Phar,4.0,2022 4 July,"
This this is amazing. It actually keeps the mosquitos away. But….then you have to buy new replacement things every day because they burn up so fast it’s crazy. They aren’t cheap either. Can’t afford to keep the mosquitos away with this thing. Only for about 30-60mins a day.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2022 19 June,"
Mosquitoes LOVE me. I use this product and I have a noticeable reduction in mosquitoes.  I have even noticed less flies around while it's on. I like that it's refillable but it seems like it kinda runs out quick. Maybe it's just mine but you are able to get hours off of 1 pad. I recommend

TV Viewer and Reader ;Linda,5.0,2022 4 July,"
Our daughter gave us the repeller as a gift. We purchased these refills which have been doing the job. We like to sit outside on our patio in the evenings. The Thermacell Insect Repeller works great. No odor, just a little smoke which you can barely see. It really keeps mosquitoes away. This contained 3 bottles of repellant that just screw in and 3 pads that slide in the top. Should last many evenings  with 36 hrs of protection.

very good
"
Cynthia L.,4.0,2021 20 August,"
I love this product! No spray and it still keeps tye bugs away. I turn it on 5 or 10 minutes before I'm going to be outside and the machine does the rest. The only reason it got a 4 🌟  is the pads DO NOT last 4 hours as advertised. 2 hours max.
"
Karen M.,2.0,2022 31 July,"
While the unit does work, the pad that is saturated in mosquito repellent does work, it only lasts a maximum of 4 hours. The butane cartridge only lasts 12 hours. I’m going broke always buying these refills. Just get a big bucket candle of citronella.
"
Billi  Wilson-Andrzejewski,5.0,2021 7 November,"
These work thank God, or I would not have been able to enjoy my outside porch.I do think they a expensive, based on how long they last. I made sure to turn it off if I was going inside so it wasn't wasted.
"
SAVVY PERFECTIONIST,5.0,2021 20 July,"
I USE EVERYDAY AND ORDERING MORE AFTER THIS REVIEW.  EXPENSIVE FOR ME FOR HOW MANY HOURS IT LASTS AND SO IS EXPENSIVE!  WORTH IT TO NOT GET BIT BECAUSE IT WORKS!  I GOT BIT WHEN WALKING MY DOG AND NEVER FELT THE MOSQUITO BITE UNTIL MY HAND SWELLED UP!SO IT'S WORTH IT AND THERE IS NO SMELLY ORDER 'AT ALL!'  SO THAT'S A BIG PLUS!!!
"
Tana H,4.0,2021 16 July,"
Refills are a tad too expensive but the unit works so in the long run, it is worth it.
"
ABT,2.0,2022 28 August,"
It is too expensive, compared to repellent. Mosquitos don't care about it. Save your money.
"
Vern,5.0,2020 27 July,"
Product seems to work as advertised. Except runs out of fliud to soon ! I think the heat we have been having added to that. We got 1 tank of fuol to 1 pad !  We have ordered more refills. Or maybe that 1st one was defective.  I only had 1 of those sneaky bast\*€+  you know what i mean !  Lol must have been hiding under the table. 😁😮 I ""ll give another review if it doesn't get better on the 2nd rd

"
PJC7221,3.0,2021 16 August,"
I got my 12 hour butane refill but it only lasted 7 hours. At this rate if the other 2 reills go at the same rate Ive paid for 21 hours ;94 a 36 hr cost.Still would recommend but say its really expensive.
"
Piwacket,4.0,2020 25 September,"
This does keep them away, but it seems like the butane doesn't last as long as it used to.  I was surprised when it ran out so quickly.  Oh well, for me, it works.
"
Reviewer,5.0,2020 13 August,"
If you’re on the edge, trust these really really work. We live in MN and our summer nights are full of mosquitos until we turn these on. Not the most pleasant scent but it’s bearable and worth it.Just beware the pads only last one night each and the butane maybe a few times and refills are pretty expensive. But again they work really well.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 11 October,"
As long as there is a light breeze or less it does the trick!

Orchidwild42,5.0,2020 9 December,"
This product works wonderfully. Used with the Therma Cell unit. This unit will keep mosquito's at bay for a 15' to 16' radius.  Here in FL we deal with massive amounts of misquotes during late summer. This will protect you even in the swamps  & during hunting season. No KIDDING!!!
"
lottie sharpe,5.0,2021 24 July,"
I'm usually the one getting bitten all the time. I literally being this everywhere with me and the mosquitoes leave me, and the fam alone!
"
Ska,5.0,2020 6 September,"
The repeller that these are made for works GREAT for keeping mosquitos off our porch. We set it at our feet so it wafts up all around us, and it truly keeps mosquitos (and usually flies) away. LOVE IT! Just remember to turn it off when you go inside or you’ll run out the cartridge.
"
Brian&Felicia March,5.0,2021 18 January,"
I do really like these. I have found it most effective to place this product closer to the floor, especially if your legs are exposed and you're on a raise porch/ deck.  It really works well and there's no harsh odors.
"
Mary Lucia Norris,5.0,2021 16 August,"
Effective and yet compact!  No noise, no order, and no bugs!!!
"
Ashley,5.0,2020 30 July,"
This item, combined with the Thermacell bug repellant, is awesome. Sure, refills are a little costly, but I get eaten alive even on my deck. I always have on bug spray and a fan going, and this is really the only thing that truly works. I hope they make them forever.
"
Randel Van Blaricom,4.0,2020 15 October,"
didn't use enough to give it a 5, but it did work as advertised.
"
Carol T. Dean,5.0,2021 4 July,"
Works well in my old container. Great value and no scent noticeable with overhead fan on.
"
Kari,1.0,2022 21 July,"
Buy from product website or sporting goods store instead. I attempted to save myself a trip to the store/shipping costs from ordering online but these are a waste of money. Purchasing elsewhere ensures  the 4 hour lasting capability of the refill pads. These start turning white after 10-15 minutes of use and don’t last more than 45 minutes. No issues with the fuel refill as of yet.
"
Beverly,4.0,2020 15 June,"
Since I just now got this I can’t comment on any aspect of the product. Will be glad to offer later
"
John R,5.0,2021 13 August,"
It works. Thats the bottom line. 👍👍
"
Papajay,5.0,2020 3 September,"
The best mosquito repeller I've used, once you start it up, wait 10-15 minutes & it pretty much clears them out. You forget it's there because, being you're not getting bit by mosquitos, your not thinking about them.
"
adgey,1.0,2022 3 September,"
I bought directly from Thermacell and it worked perfectly. Then I found these on Amazon. I sue them the same and they do nothing to keep mosquitoes away. Don’t waste your money.

Works. Cartridge needs to be replaced every 3 hours or so, but it does work. Easy to inssert.

Rob,4.0,2018 10 August,"
Works almost perfectly. You just have to make sure you start it about 15 min. before you actually need it because it needs to warm up to be effective.

"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 15 August,"
Mosquito loves me and we couldn’t use our porch anytime of the day without being eaten alive. My neighbor was having the same problem and ordered this product first. I waited to see if it really worked and after a week I decided I would order one too. It does what it is supposed to do. My only issue with is the cost versus time used it doesn’t last very long, and you need to change the fuel pad often. Love it but not cheap.

Jonathan Martin,5.0,2021 25 June,"
I thought the refills were priced a little higher than I expected but If you go up in quantity the deal gets better. I dont typically use them all day anyways, just in the evenings when the bugs get the most annoying. Been working quite well!

Caitlin,5.0,2022 16 August,"
We can’t use open flames outside where we live. I like the thermacell as an alternate to the citronella candels and feel like it works. It’s a nice way to also avoid having repellent directly on your skin. This pack came as expected and fits our thermacell.

I’m never going back to a duffel bag for the gym.  This is sturdy but still lightweight.  It has a larger pocket for my main stuff.  After my shower the wet towel and sandals have another smaller pocket on the front to go into so as not to soak my other clothes.  I also use the front for swim trunks.  The only change I would make would be a little larger bottle holders on the sides.  These are a bit tight for a blender bottle sized cup.  The tiny pocket on the front holds my earbuds, wallet, and lock just fine.  It’s a bit snug for a large cell phone though.

My son is loving his Adidas soccer bag.We had initially purchased an off brand bag (not knowing if he would stick with the sport), but the thing looked worn out by the end of spring session and completely shredded by the end of summer camp.By comparison, he’s used the same adidas duffle for his martial arts gear did the past 4 years and it still looks new.We replaced his soccer bag and couldn’t be happier.Would love if this bag had a shoe pocket on the bottom, but overall very pleased

Anonymous Reader,5.0,2021 24 March,"
Has held up well for over a year with no issues. pre-pandemic, used 2-3x a week for indoor and futsal games, holding ball, cleats, pumps, socks, tape, phone, water bottle, keys, etc. Only had one small tear of a drawstring on one side that didn't affect the pocket holding the ball securely. It would be great if it had a laptop sleeve as I like using this backpack as a general use / travel backpack as well. Also get compliments on this bag, and my teammate saw it and bought the same one. Would recommend this bag and would buy again.
"
edcolion,5.0,2021 15 October,"
I like this backpack! It has great compartments, very durable. I also noticed that at the bottom of the bag the fabric is different, more like a water proof texture, I like that it is different because it is more durable and will not get dirty easily!

"
Dan B,5.0,2021 6 March,"
We purchased this for my son for soccer.  His team had an order through a third party for close to double the price so we took to amazon to find a better deal, although not with embroidery.  His bag holds his ball and has several compartments for uniform, cleats, socks, drinks etc.  Everything needed in one convenient pack so everything is not all over the place.  I am glad that we purchased this.
"
Christopher Blake,5.0,2021 26 April,"
It was perfect for using as a track bag, while it didn’t say it would work as a track bag, it has the room for my foam rollers and a few hand rollers in the first portion of the bag. The second portion is made to fit shoes or spikes and it works very well for when I need to put my spikes into a protected area of the bag.
"
Brandy,5.0,2021 18 June,"
This is a great soccer bag at great price. Second one I've purchased because my other child started playing for the same soccer club. Navy soccer bags are hard to find and I feel we ""scored"" finding this one. Ample space for cleats, ball and pockets for other things. Great value and a great looking backpack.

I bought two of these for my middle school kids. We received them quickly. They was very good quality for half the price of local sports shop stores. Both bags are used daily. Enough room for cleats, clothes, shin guards and everything else they need in their bags. The straps are well padded for a comfortable fit on the shoulders.

Enika Frasheri,5.0,2020 18 June,"
Love the fact that you can fit 3 balls in this bag but that does not leave a lot of room for much else - Very versatile as you can carry all you need for soccer practice or if you want to head to the park to have fun. Many color selections to choose from. - beware of the tiny straps by the zipper heads as they ten to come apart. It you take a bit of time to heat the nylon straps you will protect them.

Stephanie Kern,5.0,2021 3 July,"
I wish we had bags like this when I was in school playing soccer. I was surprised how well my daughter's soccer ball fit into the bag while still having room for other stuff.  I couldn't even tell her ball was in there.
"
Robert,5.0,2021 4 March,"
Awesome bag, well made and sturdy.I use this to keep most items needed for my whole team - jerseys, ball, first aid kit - along with my equipment. The separate ball and shoe compartments make it easy to pack up for games/practice. The small pouch keeps phone, keys, wallet, etc. all secure.Really happy with the bag.

Derek N,5.0,2021 25 July,"
Best backpack for soccer.  This is my 2nd one for son.  He had his last one for 5 yrs.  also just bought this in pink and navy for my other kids.  Highly recommend
"
Timothy Bolden,5.0,2021 30 January,"
Bought for 11 year old soccer player. Has a lot of space and is a great backpack for a soccer player because it’s spacious for water, soccer ball, cleats, shin guards and extra clothing. If you child or you play soccer this backpack is a must! The backpack is sturdy and looks like it will last long. Thank you!
"
Cameron,5.0,2021 20 May,"
I like it's lifetime warranty so I know this pack is made well.  Very sturdy and not as bulky as some of the other soccer packs I've seen kids use. Side pockets for water bottles could be a more loose to fit in bigger bottles but it was stitched well.

KDW,3.0,2020 7 February,"
All three of my kids (ages 10 and 6) received these soccer bags for Christmas - they play year round and are headed multiple times a week to soccer practice/games. We love the space and various pouches this bag offers for snacks, gloves, a water bottle, shin guards, cleats, sandals, a change of clothes, futsal shoes, and a ball! My only complaint is that of the three bags I purchased, two have now proven faulty. The first one I was able to replace inside the 30-day window - the drawstring of the ball pouch ripped. On the second bag the mesh water bottle pouch ripped from the elastic edging one day after the 30-day window, so I'm currently trying to reach Adidas to resolve the issue. Both instances occurred after only using the bag less than a month. For a sports bag lugged around by active kids I would think the assembly and stitching would be reinforced for durability. Again, we love the functionality, appearance, and size, but are disappointed by the quality of this bag distributed by a reputable brand.

"
Hammer,5.0,2021 1 February,"
With covid, my player cannot store his gear in the gymnasium locker room for hoops. He has to carry it with him in school. This bag is big enough for his clothes, shoes, accessories and a ball.  Not too big and not too small. Perfect for practice time and games.

I love this pack.  I am a soccer coach and I keep ALL of my supplies in it. Pumps, first aid kit, wrap tape, clipboards, you name it!  Such a light but sturdy bag.  Just wish I would have bought it sooner.  Oh yeah, and the color is POPPIN'!
"
colleen reid,5.0,2021 14 March,"

"
Stephanie,5.0,2019 2 August,"
I bought this for my daughter, she was looking for a bag that can hold her soccer ball. She’s also obsessed with adidas so this was actually perfect. The bag is very spacious and the inside has a pretty color. I work long hours so sometimes she has to stay at my mothers house and she’s able to pack her next day clothes along with all of her soccer stuff and everything fits in perfectly. She absolutely loves it.  Would definitely recommend.  Everything is exactly as they advertised. Thanks!
"
Jess,4.0,2020 9 September,"
This is definitely a good quality backpack. I gave it 4 stars only because it is on the small side if you have a middle or high school age student. I actually wound up buying something different with a larger capacity.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 10 April,"
This is a great backpack and feels like built for soccer players. I can easily put in my soccer ball, cleats, 2/3 pairs of socks, shinguard, spare jersey, ball pump, spray, gatorades etc. My only complaint would be that I have to put in everything before the soccer ball. If I put in the soccer ball first, then I have to struggle to fit in everything (specially the cleats). Also, sometimes chaining up with the ball inside is a tad difficult but not much of an issue. Honestly, I am nitpicking at this point. Overall great product. Highly recommended.

"
Black Cat,5.0,2018 16 October,"
This is the fifth Adidas Stadium backpack we own.  Had the previous version for soccer which came apart at the top seams so decided to upgrade to the Stadium II.  It did not disappoint. This bag is slightly larger in all compartments which easily holds all the gear which is needed going into colder weather.  Having the option to use the mesh drawstring to carry a ball outside or inside was a nice upgrade. Have one bag for soccer and use another for Basketball. If deciding between the older version and the Stadium II, the Stadium II is a better choice.
"

MomtoFive,5.0,2019 28 February,"
I wanted to leave a review because I searched for HOURS trying to find a bag for my daughter. I never did find a small bag that was pink and good quality so I opted to just buy one of the best soccer backpacks out there and hope it wasn’t too big.The bag is perfect! Yes it’s big but it’s not ginormous. My daughter is about average height for her age. The bag goes down to her butt but it’s not so big it’s in the way and she will be able to use this bag for many years.

Jong Lee,4.0,2018 6 November,"
This backpack has frame edge on the water bottle holders/pockets and on the bottom of the backpack so it can stand. Plus, the water bottle pocket is deeper. It also has a bigger pocket for your headbands and other small things. Additionally, the ball compartment has double support. Mesh and top fabric on the backpack. I am very impressed with this backpack and I’m very excited to use it for the first time today.
"
Daniel Jennings,4.0,2019 27 June,"
This is a $50 backpack for soccer. Fits light needs - shoes, tape, water, soccer ball.I don’t like the mesh pullout holder for the ball. It doesn’t tighten too much to keep the ball in place.Probably not a good bag for keepers with jerseys and gloves and other specific needs.Overall, it is a nice backpack. Just don’t expect it to be “top of the line”.

Vixen Foxx,1.0,2022 27 March,"
Extremely disappointed.I purchased this backpack around September of last year, but didn’t start using it until about a month ago.The handle at the top is tearing away from the base, the arm straps are now starting to do the same thing. I’ve hardly got any use out of this backpack and it’s literally falling apart on me and about to be unusable. And because of when I purchased this, there’s nothing anyone can do to help me apparently. Not Amazon, not Adidas.But let’s be real here, even if I were using it every day since September, even that is unacceptable to have this bag tearing in me in such short time.If you won’t make your products of good quality, at least give your customers better customer service. I feel ripped off. Do better.
"
alejandra e.,4.0,2019 28 May,"
The bag looks great! I took it on a camping trip & plan to continue using it for other occasions. Fits lots of stuff. The only problem is that it is not very comfortable to wear because it's a bit large. I saw the photos someone posted of their young child wearing it, but it definitely appears to be bigger in person!
"
Wanderer,5.0,2020 9 October,"
Great soccer backpack! Fits a full size ball inside with plenty of room for other gear. Plus deep water bottle pockets. Lots of zip up pockets for various items! Perfect for my teen.
"
SoYouKnow,2.0,2022 10 March,"
I like the color, green is great and inside is lime, which is fun. Nice Adidas styling. Yet.  Zippers do not stay closed. And, for a soccer bag/for people on the go, people who move fast...is not secure. Have lost stuff due to this fact. Inane. And costly.

This bag is everything I needed as I was looking for an alternative to bringing around a duffle bag. Duffles make it tiresome after a while and this bag had all the room I needed.  Another good thing about it is the different compartments, one for shoes, ball, and an area to put clothes and other amenities. Overall, a well rounded bag with a nice aesthetic too.

"
ashley,2.0,2021 13 August,"
I purchased this backpack for my middle school son to start school with. After day 2 we have realized this backpack is not big enough for his daily items he has to carry. It does not expand very much. We will have to purchase a different backpack that expands more. Other than that, seems like a good quality backpack but if you will be carrying multiple items, it may not be a good choice.
"

Great packpack!! Well made with strong"" reinforced straps for heavy school day loads. My daughter loves the sporty and stylish look.
"
Lori D,5.0,2019 3 October,"
Love the expandable ball holder that zips away when not needed, doubles as a wet stuff holder.  Good balance in size.  I use for gym and field.
"
Elizabeth D.,3.0,2020 11 July,"
The material was very thin and very little structure. It feels like a bag pack rather then a back pack. I anticipate this backpack will last our ten year old a single school year, if that.  His last backpack was a Paragon, it lasted three years!
"

Both my kids have lugged these around for the last 2.5 years. They still look pretty much new despite rough handling. Just make sure you put the ball in before you pack the rest of the bag. Great soccer bag!

Great back! Sturdy material. My son Carrie's it everywhere. Soccer ball, cleats, clothes and water bottle all fit with room to spare.
"
Claire C.,2.0,2020 25 February,"
After the first use, the adjustable cord popped and no longer holds the soccer ball. I bought this a few months prior to giving my daughter as a gift, hence the Amazon return window passed. I contacted Adidas, they ensured there was a lifetime warranty. Except... I needed to contact a THIRD point of contact..... their manufacturer. I will just buy another brand and call it quits on this backpack. Not a big purchase, but crappy customer service on faulty product from a reputable brand.

"
LB,2.0,2018 22 June,"
If you carry a ball and cleats, there’s very limited room in the large zippered pocket for anything else. In the small zippered valuables pocket, it was very difficult to fit a wallet, phone, and keys. They had to be forcefully squished in.  I like to carry a ball, cleats, shin guards, socks, extra shirt, pump, and large water bottle. I could fit it all in the bag eventually, but it took a lot of squeezing/maneuvering.  I personally need a larger bag, but this might work well for you if you don’t have a lot of stuff.

This bag is the perfect size! It holds a size 5 ball easily along with uniform, extra socks, change of clothes, indoor and regular cleats, and a water bottle. The separate pockets help with keeping everything organized. It’s the perfect bag for my teen and all his gear!

G. Little,5.0,2019 8 May,"
I am very picky about bags.  This was the third one I ordered. We are on our third season with this bag.  It easily fits everything you could possibly need for a soccer or basketball player.  We even used it as a baseball bag because a helmet with faceguard will fit into the ball pocket. One small complaint is that the water bottle pockets are a bit tight for reusable water bottles.  Overall, very happy with this purchase.

UPDATE: After a complete season of soccer, this backpack is still going strong. Material is super strong, and the bottom is in great shape. He not only uses it for soccer gear, but also as his daily book bag for high school. Zippers are still in one piece, straps are not showing any signs of stress, and the carry handle is doing great as well. Well constructed and the stitching is still  holding strong.Definitely would purchase this pack again!!Exactly what my son wanted for soccer. Awesome pack and looks like it should last for quite some time.

"
Ricky Cavazos,4.0,2021 20 November,"
I was looking for a large backpack to use for the gym. This backpack has two large compartments. In the main compartment, I can easily fit my weight lifting belt, my weight lifting gloves, knee sleeves, wrist wraps, barbell bar clamps, and elbow sleeves. I use the second compartment to store my weight lifting shoes.There is a small pocket / compartment right above the compartment where the soccer ball is supposed to go. It is very small, and the only item I am able to fit comfortably in it are the keys to my vehicle. Therefore, I use the compartment intended for the soccer ball to store the keys to my vehicle as well as my cell phone, which fits much better.
"

"
Momma Mould,5.0,2021 20 December,"
As a mother of 5, with 3 in school I've been on the hunt for backpacks that will actually hold up all school year and not have to be patched or completely replaced by Christmas. This is it. These are the best backpacks by far that I have ever purchased. My daughter doesn't have a locker and has to haul all of her stuff around classroom to classroom all day and this backpack has stood up to the challenge. The padded shoulder straps are life changing and no more whining in the mornings while trying to get out the door about heavy backpacks or awkward backpacks. Tons of room inside for everything your littles may need for school and then some. My school age range from middle school-3rd and it's the perfect size even being a larger backpack. We will never go back to anything else if you're looking for a sign to buy this, this is it.

Faith ,5.0,2021 24 August,"
I bought this for my son he’s just now starting fourth grade. And this is the backpack that he just had to have! A little pricey for a fourth grader but I’m very happy with it purchase!Is extremely durable and will ask him for a couple years at least. It’s very very very spacious!!!I have two very large main compartments. A small microfiber lined Pocket in the front top that hold his phone (IPhone 6s plus)And I have a very awesome bottom compartment that has a net inside of it.Are you unzip it and open the compartment and it’s a completely huge spacious place that could fit like a basketball without taking up any room of the main compartments.I definitely recommend buying this product!

karinatwork,5.0,2018 5 September,"
The way this is designed makes it pretty much a great school backpack. I don't know about you, but my kid doesn't carry a laptop to school. Not sure why 99% of backpacks these days have a laptop compartment. This one does not have one, and also no excessive padding inside (which is - again - not needed). In the soccer ball compartment, he puts his gym strip (separate from everything else, when it gets wet and smelly). In the shoe compartment, he can put his shoes AND his lunch bag. And in the main compartment, he was able to fit three 1.5"" binders and his pencil case. The top compartment that is fleece lined is perfect for this phone, or a calculator, or anything else small. Two side pockets for bottles, and a waterproof bottom. The straps are also well padded, and it has reflective strips on each side. I mean, can you say ""perfect""?
"
PatrickYGW,5.0,2019 8 May,"
Excelent backpack for sports athletes! The interior is all made of some plastic material, which is perfect to put dirty clothes and boots. The small pocket is enough for keys, phone and wallet. The ball pocket is very usefull to put dirty boots, and in the boots pocket I actually put dirty clothes. So in the main pocket I leave only clean clothes and towel. It is very confortable for the back as well. The only thing I would add is a chest strap so it wouldn't bounce when walking longer distances in a fast pace. Because of the plastic interior and how easy it is to clean it, I also use it to go to the beach!

Bought for my six year old.  He can easily take his basketball and/or soccer ball to school with lots of room for school books, lunch bags,etc.  I was worried that it would be too big but with straps at shortest position it is perfect fit.  He loves it and it looks durable enough to last a few years.

The new age of wearing ergonomic backpacks to work no matter if you’re in an office or construction site is here. This works amazing for my husband who uses it daily AND we found out 5 months later that it fits a pair of rollerblades. So here I am ordering one for myself in red.

Right. after 3 years of ownership, I feel like I can finally make a review of this backpack. For some backstory, this backpack has been with me since freshman year and now I’m going into senior year. It’s been to every one of my sporting events, every classroom, been across the country a few times, and much more. There’s 2 main compartments in this bag. One for “shoes” (which I rarely used for said purpose) and another for storing the bulk of your things. This bag doesn’t have a laptop compartment so I have a laptop sleeve for my Mac. My only complaint with the main compartment is that if you have a binder with rubber on the edges (staples binder) then it’ll catch on the material inside which means you have to pull the material or just shove it down. Other than that, it’s fine. The backpack can hold everything you need and still not break your back. The water bottle holders are great. I used one for my bike lock and another to hold my 1L camelback bottle. There’s a compartment on the bottom which can fold out to either hold a ball, helmet or anything you decide. I’ve used it to hold my bike helmet, football, and soccer ball. It was perfect every time. I also do appreciate the rubber like material on the bottom however I found that if scratched on asphalt or any abrasive surface, it starts to peel off and doesn’t stop. The rubber surface is just a film so you can rest the bag on the ground without fear of the bottom getting wet, etc. Great thought, sub par execution. If you wanted you can just put black duct tape over it, but I left mine how it is since I don’t mind that much. On the topic of zippers, they’re some of the best I’ve ever used. Never been stuck or jammed in anyway and they’re always smooth. If adidas makes another version with a padded laptop sleeve and enhanced rubber bottom, I’d 100% buy it again.

So I got my ps4 pro on Friday came it pretty quick I was very surprised when it did how ever when I opened the box the box it self look a hot mess and wasn’t  sure if it was worth the money that I had spent on it but seeing how my old ps4 was having a bit of a fan problem and over heating issue I had no choice but to spend the money and hope that it was worth the buy so after checking it out and making sure nothing wasn’t damaged or broken Whitch it wasn’t I was happy I had plugged it in and started transferring all my data on to the pro and so far I’ve been playing on it for a couple of days no problems yet that I Knw of but it’s nice and quiet and doesn’t sound like a jet about to take off am very happy with this product how ever wasn’t happy that I had to spend the money on it but seeing how it will be a million years before I can get my hands on a ps5 this was as best for an upgrade over all am a satisfied customer and will continue to play my games ☺️Just make sure to ask yourself if you really wanna spend that kind of money for a ps4 pro or if you rather just hold out til you can get a ps5

Phillip Peeler,4.0,2021 14 October,"
Liked quick shipping 7 days early liked that unit was clean and fan was quiet started right up did not like the control the sent it was a nasty gold color dirty and sticky I won’t send back for that but you should expect the same with controller all cables present and working overall very glad the unit was solid so far(3 days in)
"
ANGELA RUSSELL,2.0,2022 30 June,"
I’m hoping the seller or someone will get back to my question on network issues that I left in the questions section… I’m not sure if it’s normal, but the fan is super loud, like obnoxiously loud. Also, form the beginning I have had issues connecting to the PlayStation network. Not Wi-Fi, but PlayStation network. I have synced my clock to the Internet and I have set this as my primary console, but nothing so far has worked. It’s getting worse every day. This last week I have spent probably 30-45 minutes each night just trying to get connected or reconnected to my game. Tonight, I have been trying for an hour to connect and still not successful. That would be frustrating on its own, but I only have an hour to an hour and a half to play each night, so it’s basically worthless to me right now.

Coco nut,5.0,2021 11 June,"
Got my arm twisted into buying a ps4 so I could game with my bf since it's not looking like he'll be getting his ps5 this year. Looked at Walmart where used consoles are at LEAST 700 bucks which is ridiculous alone for 8 year-old tech, used or not. Checked Amazon with low expectations and found this gem at a great price- next lowest was around $600. Not only did this seller ship it immediately to have it arrive at my doorstep a couple days earlier than expected, they even asked which color controller i wanted! My new (used, but I'd never know it) ps4 pro runs perfectly, and the controller has none of those weird drifting issues I've heard about. I would give 10 stars if I could. Thank you!

josh horton,5.0,2022 10 January,"
First off, this got here almost a week early in the original PS4 Pro box which was a nice surprise. No signs of wear on the console, games, or either of the controllers. I have been using it for a few days and have had no issues.

"
Omar,3.0,2022 4 April,"
All's well but the only gripe I have is the Japanese message after the Playstation logo on start up and my dvds will not play because the console is region locked.
"
Chris,3.0,2022 9 February,"
•There was a dent on the right corner, and the box was a bit beat up with scratches. That could've been the cause of it.•The ps4 pro had everything but it's own power cord, I had to order one in order to turn it on.
"
NIKOV,5.0,2020 29 June,"
Definitely recommend this product and seller. Just an fyi, Their contact info came in the box and also had a disclaimer that basically said if you had ANY questions do not hesitate to reach out. The first ps4 we got had some kinks and didn't stay on when we inserted a game, but they were more than patient with us on having it replaced. The ps4 pro we have now runs great and is very quiet compared to our regular ps4 and our ps3. Even when the fan runs from a large game it's not very loud. I will say the ps4 pro is a tad bigger than the regular ps4 but it didn't take up any extra space on out tv stand. We absolutely love it!!
"
Davion huell,4.0,2019 8 September,"
Pardon for my late review. I recieve my ps4 pro about a week ago from my courier and everything is perfect so far except for it seems like something is wrong with my controller. If I'm in a menu or something, even just playing a game my cursor just keep scrolling up as if I'm pushing up on the analog stick. This happen only sometime and can be annoying if I'm playing a gun game that require aiming, my character would just constantly be looking up even when I'm trying to center the view to get an accurate aim. I doubt this is the console and more to be the controller issue. Otherwise I'm loving my upgrade from the base ps4 to the pro. The only reason this ain't a 5 star is because of my control. Now I guess I'm gonna have to buy one.
"
Michelle,4.0,2020 12 May,"
Playstation worked great and was packaged nicely. Didnt have a single problem with the product. 4 stars instead of 5 because i went through the trouble to have this delivered to my parents house inatead of mine with the understanding that at the price of 500$ it needed to be signed for upon drop off. Well guess what the ups driver dropped the package on the front step never even knocked on the door. My dad who is ritired watched him pull up drop the package and leave went downstairs thinging it was one of his deliveries to find out it was my playstation 4 pro.
"
S. Warren,5.0,2021 15 April,"
Been happy with PS4.  Sadly after 7 years I came across a usb adapter thought be nice to add  keyboard and mouse to it without changing the only 2 usb; sadly over time because of that stupid adapter my ps4 started having usb problems.  At one point none of the usb worked.  Never again will I do that.  Lasted 7 years till it did that.  So now i have the PS4 Pro it is wonderful has 3 USB Hurray!!!!!
"
Malcolm McDonald,5.0,2021 13 October,"
I will not lie, I was deeply concerned on whether or not this system was actually going to be an authentic PS4, ESPECIALLY when all the instructions/product info was in Spanish! I thought I had been scammed. I’ve had it for almost 3 months now, no issues whatsoever and performs wonderfully. Genuinely impressed.
"
Will Burton,4.0,2019 9 December,"
I purchased the ps4 pro from Maze tech. I'm not sure what model it is.  It has  7215b on the box but has 6.20 firmware on it.  So I really don't know what model it is.  I don't hear the fan but it could be the firmware keeping the fan noise down.  I borrowed minecraft and had freezing and glitches  but it could just be the  game.  I decided to upgrade the firmware to 7.00 which seemed to help. I'll write another review when my order of doom arrives and test it again.  All in all it seems to be a good console.
"
Eddie,4.0,2021 30 May,"

I had issues with ps4 not having video on multiple televisions. However if I could I would give 10 star rating. Absolutely the best customer service I've had possibly ever.
"
Jose,5.0,2021 1 February,"
It works fine. It’s not what I expected but it does do everything it says it will but mind you that all your cords from the system and the tv make it hard to place it in certain spots so you have to accommodate thee area you plan on putting it. Other that great buy. Oh almost forgot the place to hold the games is a little short so the will slip out it you don’t back it up against something.
"
Michael,4.0,2020 6 September,"
Was as shown new in box, not 5 star because the money spent, looks like box was thrown around, beat up and packed with b.s. paper towels, not even the good bubble packaging they have that I get with a $20=-/.But I have a 4k tv bought from W.M., for $200, and it's worth having the smart 4k tv rather then a reg flat screen.

Plays games and all that fun stuff, but the wifi on mine seems a bit screwy.  It usually works, but will crap out on occasion and become unable to use the internet.  Outside that, it's good.
"
Katie Thornton-Wiatt,5.0,2020 7 April,"
Our old PS4 died suddenly, and we are stuck at home due to the COVID019 shelter in place order. We use our PS4 for games and movies, so we were delighted to be able to get one on Amazon that arrived very quickly. We are back to watching our movies and games. This came with 1 PS4 Controller, so if you need more than one controller you will need to purchase the second controller separately. It did come with the appropriate cords and instructions, and was packaged to endure shipping without damage.
"
Mr. Nerdy Dad,4.0,2020 24 July,"
Fan sounds great, which is why we had to replace our old console, and haven't had any issues. The controller pulls to the side which is annoying and sometimes inconvenient, but overall good buy. However, I would have looked at other sellers if I had known there was no warranty available.

Playstation 4 pro delivers .

"
Eleanor,4.0,2020 28 January,"
The original controller packaged with the console was faulty, however the seller sent a replacement and return label. They have good communication if you are the one to message them. The system itself seems slightly slower than most PS4 Pro consoles, and some minor physical damage can be seen if you look closely. Overall good condition.
"
Lady Jerzy,5.0,2020 5 May,"
The shipping had some problems because of UPS was a little concerned because my shipping box was open when I picked it up from UPS I tested everything the playstation box was not open so I know everything inside was new. I am enjoying my system no complaints as far as the playstation it looks beautiful on my 75 inch 4k tv thank you I'm now playing call of duty.

Console works. Was equally eagar to get an additional controller only to have the R2 trigger fall out immediately after taking it out of packaging. Everything was very poorly wrapped and protected in package I'm amazed the console made it in one piece.
"
Sherman Gee,5.0,2020 23 November,"
I like that the price was very reasonable and the product was everything that they say it was seeing the joy on my grandson face when he plug it up and play the game and go online with his friends was a joy after his other PlayStation was not repairable
"
Joshua C. Perry,4.0,2019 2 November,"
everything was as expected, EXCEPT the controller. I know the seller would likely not know, but the right analog stick is defective and constantly aims upwards, making live-action games near impossible. I am overall satisfied with my purchase, but the issue of having to spend $60 on another controller does bother me.

Bought it new. Works like a brand new system. No problems no loud noises. Updated the system and it didn't take long actually id say 10-15 minutes for the 8.00 update. Everything was packaged and individually sealed. Will be purchasing from the seller again in the future.

I was late getting a next gen console because I specifically wanted the ps4 pro and was hoping the price would drop faster. But I am very happy with it. I upgraded the hdd right away to a 2tb, and I use the original as external memory. The only thing I wish I could have gotten was an extended warranty like Amazon offers on most of their electronics, but it wasn't an option :/

Lucas,1.0,2020 5 August,"
I have to unfortunately give this listing a 1 star as the item listed is NOT what you're getting.I ordered a NEW 1tb PS4 Pro from HALF TIME. When i got it, the packaging was dirty, but i thought nothing of it. I went to open it and found that the Tamper Sticker (the little clear circle) had clearly been removed and put back on. I again, thought that maybe it had just come off with age.I opened the box and... wow. The controller was disgusting. The stand was a third party stand and was covered in dirt and dust,. The unit itself was scuffed and damaged and also covered in dust.Here's the kicker- THE UNIT WASN'T EVEN A PRO. They shipped me a USED PS Slim in a PS4 pro box, complete with masking tape to keep the cardboard down over the unit. See the images above for proof- The Serial numbers didn't even match. So overall, not very happy with my buying experience. Paid $500 for a use PS4 Slim model, that I would assume probably doesn't even work. I tried to contact the Support number for HALF TIME and guess what- disconnected.👎 I do not recommend buying this from this listing!
"
Christopher,5.0,2020 2 April,"
Great for watching 4k movies, playing games, etc. The user interface is 100% better than the slim i recommend itEdit: I forgot to add that if you go under ps4 settings you can turn on boost mode which is for games that can't be in 4k but it will be given a fps boost

PS4 arrived much earlier than expected. PS4 box was shipped in an unmarked box so as to protect the contents.

Was hesitant on getting this due to the close release of the PS5, though at launch, the ps5 won't have all the new exclusives and third party games being released. So while I wait on that, decided now is a good time to play the arsenal of games the PS4 had in store.

When with the PlayStation as I’ve had good experience in the past. So far, enjoy everything the pro offers over the slim. Highly also suggest a wall mount that you can buy on Amazon as it makes it very clean and out-of-the-way.

Obviously was not new. Box was ragged. I should have taken a picture. Controller was no new either the controller was very used. Ended up buying a new one because the one that came with it had issues with the sticks pulling in directions even when not being used. The system istelf has been working fine.Overall i should have just bought new. The system was free and clear of all old info and has been working fine. Just don't advertise new systems if you're going to ship a clearly ragged box, and obviously worn controller.Ordered and recieved feb 2020Update may 2020. They changed the advertisement to used like new. Im happy for that.

The PS4 is so much fun!!! I havent had a gaming system since Super Nintendo came out so there is a ton I have to learn, but so far its a blast!!!

Madison,3.0,2020 25 May,"
We have had nothing but trouble with every controller we have used on our Ps4..  we have the controller that came with it, we bought a new controller, also tried using my brothers controller and none of them will connect to the Ps4 longer than 10 minutes.

I had never played console games.  I only had a PSP before.Now I know that console games are the best.PS: its Blu-ray functionality is not so great.  Buy an stand-alone Blu-ray player for movies won't waste your money.

The Ps4 Pro came in fine no damages to itself and accessories. But when booting it up it gave me an error saying ""Cant start Ps4. Cannot access system storage."" So i took a look at its hard drive and it was an incompatible Seagram Mobile 1tb HDD which doesn't work with the ps4 pro. I had to put in my old ps4's hardrive to make sure the pro functioned like normal which it did. So total hardware failure when it comes to the HDD the pro came with.

Johnathan Fleming,1.0,2020 21 October,"
The ps4 cane damaged and when taking it out of the box, a piece fell off. We didn’t bother unpacking the rest of what was in the box because it was completely unusable. It was in such bad condition that I had to go back on Amazon and read the description over again just to make sure this wasn’t a refurbished product. I thought maybe I had made a mistake. I’m very good about reading item descriptions for anything I buy. This was a brand new PlayStation 4 pro. We are shipping it back and not sure if we’ll buy another from this company. I hardly ever leave reviews, but this was such a disappointment. I’ve been looking around locally ,and everywhere else is out of stock- even game stop. I’ve bought computers and other tech through Amazon without a problem before.

I bought this ps4 for $699 and at that moment it was listed as a ""condition: new"" product. Yet, when receiving it, the coverings are dirty, e.g. the oil in the covering. In addition, no English manual at all and no original box. I feel it is a used product.

Everything Amazon ,1.0,2020 28 December,"
Firstly it arrived several days late which really stunk because it was supposed to get here before Xmas and it was the only gift my gifts got. However we can understand that shipping during this season is unpredictable so that we can forgive. The reason for the rating I gave is because we spent so much money on this console and the seller didn’t even bother to clean it out. It’s making extremely load fan noises which is apparently caused by a dirty fan. So now I have to buy tools to open it up and hope that’s the only problem.

Khalid O.,1.0,2020 7 July,"
I recieve my ps4 pro about a week ago from my courier and everything is perfect so far except for it seems like something is wrong with my controller. If I'm in a menu or something, even just playing a game my cursor just keep scrolling up as if I'm pushing up on the analog stick. This happen only sometime and can be annoying if I'm playing a gun game that require aiming, my character would just constantly be looking up even when I'm trying to center the view to get an accurate. The only reason this ain't a 5 star is because of my control. Now I guess I'm gonna have to buy one.

Lucifer,1.0,2020 6 May,"
System worked fine. Had a really annoying clicking noise so I took it apart to see what was going on. The Playstation was literally missing parts. It was missing a few screws and a heat pad. No wonder it was making noise. And, of course, I won't be able to get a refund because taking it a part voids any type of warranty. So, if I wouldn't have taken it a part I never would have known what was wrong with it. Now that I have taken it apart, I do know what's wrong with it but I won't be able to get any type of compensation.

The system showed up with some assembly required! The bottom was hanging off and the front face plate is chipped all the way across. It honestly looked as if someone dropped it on the floor and just packaged it up anyway. After plugging it in and it miraculously turns on. Come to find out it doesn’t read ANY disc at all. It plays digital downloads just fine. But can’t recognize any other type of disc. Game, BluRay, and DVD!

Console does not function correctly at all - cannot even complete basic setup - and apparently seller didn’t check whether it worked before reselling it.

Bought this system as some entertainment during the Covid19 outbreak. It arrived 3 days earlier than expected, but this supposedly brand new system has a corrupted hard drive. It started off with every game shutting off within 5 minutes of gameplay saying the download was corrupted. I wiped and redownloaded each game - same issue. Finally restarted console and now the console won't boot at all - even in safe mode.

Advertised as Playstation 4 Pro 1Tb Console. Sounds good. I paid full price for a Playstation 4 Pro and I got a playstation slim 1 Tb Console in the mail. (The cheaper version of the playstation). Not a good look, either this is false advertising or simply a mistake. Either way its unacceptable.

the system seemed used not new and the screen randomly goes black on me in the middle of games at times. by far the most annoying thing so far will not be using amazon or this company for anymore video game products.

Only the console was in the box it didn't come with anything else. No controllers or wires I couldn't plug it in and it was covered in dirt. I got it ""Used-Like New"" and I was definitely disappointed and returned it promptly.

I got the used ps4 like it was brand new.Came with everything controller was good power cord was cord was good. Now if you playing on a 4k tv or monitor and don’t have a hdmi that supports your resolution his doesn’t sadly. So I had to order a new one other then that you should get it.The purpose for me to get this ps4 was to jailbreak It. I ordered it my ps4 version was on 8.50 so I got luck there. Cause it doesn’t tell you the firmware version on there page at least I didn’t seee. So order at your own risk if that’s your purpose.
"
xArkSlade08x,5.0,2020 29 May,"
The console is great, beautiful design, the controller feels good in hands. The graphics of the games are awesome in a 4K TV.Got a great deal on this and felt it was well worth the money spent. My only complaint is that this, like other PS consoles, lacks backwards compatibility. They should all have that ability.They should update firmware to be able play games PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation 3.Update firmware for external hard drives with expanded storage space (20+TB) and be able to use external hard drive hubs too. Hope they can fix that before they release PlayStation 5 consoles.

"
Brock Moore,1.0,2020 23 December,"
Not much to say. I’ve had it for 2 years upgrading from a regular ps4. While the original model never gave me issues, the pro has been nothing but faulty. It wouldn’t turn on all the way earlier this year, so I sent it in for repairs. Now it’s malfunctioning again. Only this time, I’m suffering more than just an inability to turn on.Sometimes it refuses to turn on. When it does, the menu lags pretty severely. Performance regarding frame rate, clarity, and basic functionality of games I run on it has suffered immensely. Stuff that ran easily on my ps4 struggles on the pro, often crashing it.All around this has been my worst console experience, only made worse by Sony’s infamously unhelpful support. I’d take a downgrade at this point.

The whole reasoning behind this gift was because my fiance helped me with my mom who just recently passed away and the simple note that I wrote for him to read was not included. It was a very sentimental note.  So it really deflated my surprise.

Stop buying products from these people. They’re sell refurbished units over price value. You’re better off going to Walmart or waiting on a PS5

I was very anxious and excited about buying my own PS4, despite it being a last gen model refurbished. My biggest concern when receiving the PS4 was the possibility of it not powering on at all or being damaged when it was transported and delivered to my address. However, that concern immediately vanished after the PS4 turned on and was functioning perfectly without any issues. I really appreciate the time and effort that went into packing the PS4 as everything was well cushioned and sealed. Not mention it arrived earlier  than expected, which was nice! Overall, I’m extremely satisfied with the PS4, and would recommend others to buy from this seller! (Will add pictures later)

I bought this brand new. A little confused about the ""new"" part. I noticed spanish on the box and manual wasn't inside of plastic packaging also was in spanish. Box was pretty beat up and seal was cut already. The console/controller look clean feel really nice no dust, wires and cables look original. I noticed the warranty stickers in the back of the console were crooked. Also in unboxing videos that playstation included stickers. I didn't find any.

I ordered this second-hand and the vendor included all the wires, one controller, and the HDD with an updated OS (only needed minor updates once activated).  Authentic PS4 Pro - BR drive works great, HDD works great, and it has no issues running the VR setup.  Excellent purchase, highly recommend.

Jaodee Limchantha,5.0,2021 13 July,"
It's a PS4 it's good-Main issue is not being able to COPY Game to another ext drive rather than just transferring.Also most Bluetooth headsets are NOT supported-ProsThe pro itself is great. It shows well in games like DS3, Bloodborne, borderlands 3 and a lot of other graphical power house games. It's also more stable from its base counterpart from what I've experienced.

"
Aaron Yun,5.0,2021 4 April,"
I have owned every home Sony console at one point or another in my life. This generation with the PS4 has been a great one. The library is stacked with a plethora of options for all types of gamers whether you're doing it casually or are hardcore. Titles ranging from Blockbuster AAA games to smaller scale indie experiences. Admittedly I think I've played less than the PS2 and PS3 eras, but I think the overall quality of the PS4 library is more well-rounded than those two. I've transitioned mainly to gaming on PC, but will play games on my PS4 that are exclusive to the console whether they are first or third-party games.The model I received was the silent revision (CUH-7215B) where the Pro no longer sounds like a jet-engine under load, you can still hear the fans a bit, but it's not bothersome. The Pro itself is a nice incremental iteration on the original model. You have access to slightly higher visual fidelity in certain games especially in ""4k"", and sometimes a performance mode. With PS5 now in the fold, it's safe to say that this model of the PS4 will slowly fade into obscurity, but the slim models should continue to be available for awhile before we completely transition into the next generation. Once the PS5 has a more robust library, I'll consider picking one up. But right now the PS4 still has a very strong library of games that I may continue to explore over time. I just bought Sakura Wars on sale and may pick up 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim at some point (Niche but loved titles by their respective communities, that are probably trapped on the PS4). Installing an SSD will help speed up install and load times for most games (Especially in MH:World and Spider Man) if you’re willing to spend a bit of extra cash.If you can get a hold of a Pro around retail price somewhere or used in good condition I highly recommend it, especially for collectors.Edit: This review was written about 2 years after the purchase of this console. It’s held up really well, granted I’m not a power user and this isn’t my main  means of gaming. Just wanted to put that out there.

Also smoother gameplay experience than the PS4.

Maggus Ro,5.0,2022 24 January,"
Läuft.Geliefert wurde eine PS4Pro mit 1TB HDD, Netzkabel, Micro-USB Kabel (nicht Original aber vergleichbar, glaub von Samsung) und ein Controller, der zwar stark benutzt (glänzende Handflächenhörner) aber vom Tastengefühl keinen Unterschied zu meinen Neu gekauften  PS4Pro Controllern haben (Akku habe ich getauscht).Die PS4Pro hat an der Unterseite an einer Stelle, von ca. 10cm Durchmesser, leicht andere Oberflächenfarbe (nicht im Kühlkörper/ Proz Bereich).Kühlkörper habe ich gereinigt und Lüfter von Dreck befreit. Dem Prozessor Ark4 WärmeLeitPasste spendiert (im Vergleich zu vorher, ist der Lüfter wesentlich leiser. Vorallem war der Proz nicht Flächendeckend mit WLP versehen...). Die PS4 ist offenbar aus einem Nichtraucher Haushalt. In den Controller habe ich einen neuen Akku eingesetzt.Kann bisher keinen Unterschied zu meiner anderen PS4 feststellen.Top.
"
Sir Faieq Ahmed,5.0,2020 13 September,"
This is my 3rd Ps4. I've had the original & the slim before this. I've noticed many differences & its all good & better changes. The major change which i really like is the fan. Before with the original I use to get the jet engine noise really loud. Now the noise is once in a while when you start game. Bare in mind, my Ps4's I've always kept it clean from it getting it dusty. I actually hoover/vacuum the side & back every three months. The slim didn't have a optical cable port but the original & the pro does have it. Also it being 1TB really helps to have alot more games installed. Another things would be the 'Cache' that builds up in system. This did have a effect on the free space on the original, but with the Pro version, not an issue. As you can see from my photo, before I had it horizontally flat out on the chest draw. Its about 3.4 inches thick laying flat meaning it did cover a bit of my t.v screen when I sat down. I decided to up it vertically by getting the stand for it. There is a option for you to game/watch in 1080p, but honestly when it comes to graphics I can't really tell the difference form my last ps4's as its all the same to me.Abit of information I learned about the console is that, it needs air to be flowing. So if you have the ps4 trapped with no air to be released behind it or if you're in a small room then it would make loud noise as the fan would need to work extra harder to get rid of thr hot air. If your room temperature is fine & mild then its fine. Just clean it from getting dusty.

Fantastic all around! The delivery timeline was amazing received it within 3 days! The controller was flawless it like using a brand new one! The PS4 did have a little mark on the top of it but to be honest you would only see it if you were actually looking for it. All in all in very happy!

Overall the PS4 is an amazing console and the PS4 Pro is no exception and I would definitely recommend it as your first choice.However as a previous PS4 owner, I had imagined lightning fast menu load speeds in terms of the Playstation Menu, store and general navigation. However it really isn't much better than the regular PS4 unfortunately. So don't make the same mistake as I did and assume that the sometimes slow load speeds of the menu would be rectified in the PS4 Pro because it really isn't, it's more for in-game quality and is generally recommended for PSVR.

Well packaged and delivered on time.I am new to gaming - getting into this during current lockdown.Ideal for my requirements but can’t comment re how it compares with competitors or previous PS4 as have never had any.Only disappointment when opening the box was that none of the booklets ie Instructions, safety and guarantee were printed in English only Nordic countries languages for some reason. However once I contacted supplier I was forwarded a download with promise of follow up booklets in English by post.

 The console didn’t come with the right power cable, I had to buy a figure 8 power cable, no usb charging cable. It’s constantly overheats and prompts me to turn off, the fan noise is a nightmare. Some minor cosmetic damage here and there but it plays fine. The controller is ok as well. Overall I am not satisfied with the product, I will have to return it.

Later model of PS4 bought late 2019 runs quietly and has no issues,  shame it doesn’t have a 4K Blu-ray Player which would have been feasible since even the Xbone S has one so that and the fact many game’s including Bloodborne do not benefit at all really from the upgrade I wouldn’t upgrade from the base PS4 unless you have a 4K HDR display and can’t wait till PS5.

Well this has been a pleasant surprise, I came from a 2013 PS4 and I've noticed a huge improvement not a lot but pretty big! The Pro is huge in comparison to the og PS4 I recently got a 4K TV and an Xbox one x and wanted to update my PlayStation too, the price is still a tad high for something that came out in 2016 it gets very warm while gaming in 4K idk if it's my LG 4K TV but playing Red dead redemption 2 seems a bit washed out it may be my HDR settings because on my one x it's crystal clear anyways I definitely recommend this awesome console!!!
"
Artin,5.0,2020 25 May,"
Came on time, all the bits and bobs were there, super easy to set up especially if you’ve  owned other ps consoles in the past. Actual console is just a beefier, faster version of the old one with more hard drive space, so really is a win win. Especially now games like warzone, take up so much disk space you’ll need it. Noticeable difference in Video quality much better, also a lot quieter that older PS4. Would recommend however could also wait for ps5 if your not desperate ?
"
George Patient,5.0,2020 11 September,"
During lockdown I had been using an original PS4 Console which was about 6 years old and needless to say, it had been well used.It was becoming a bit outdated for my 4K TV and was a bit slow so I decided to upgrade to the PS4 Pro.With the Pro, I noticed a massive difference... the picture quality was great and the speed was impressive. I am now really looking forward to the release of the PS5.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 21 July,"
I bought this on behalf of my flatmate, but since they've let me use it I've been very impressed. I'm an Xbox user myself, and althought the graphics on the One X are noticeably better, I'm loving the PS4 exclusives like Spiderman - I've been convinced to save up for a PS5 at some point as well as a Series X! My flatmate also bought an external Samsung T5 SSD, which definitely improves loading times for it.
"
VC,1.0,2021 22 December,"
I bought a second hand PS4 from this company. It was described as being in Like New condition. It arrived soon enough, and everything seemed okay. Everything was in the box, and it looked okay. I then plugged everything in and tried to turn it on, and nothing happened! I used to own the same type of PS4 years ago, so I know what is supposed to happen. The console they sent me does not work. I am furious and I am going to do what I can to get a refund, but, I'm not optimistic about that happening. The first thing I have decided to do is leave this review. People deserve to know that something like this might happen. Do not buy from this company! I spent hundreds of pounds on equipment that does not work, and I don't want that to happen to anyone else.

Nathan,2.0,2021 12 September,"
i sold the Launch pro model and went for the 7200 off amazon to reduce the fan noise because people have assured me it is quieter, however there is literally no difference in the fan noise between the 2 models when everybody tries to tell you there is.. i opened mine up cleaned the heatsink, cleaned the fan, replaced the thermal paste and the thermal pads and it still appears to be just as loud/Noisy.

The item I ordered came early and got everything I ask for I would order again the only problem I had was who deliverd it which was DPD there didn’t even get the write address but luckily there is honest people about so I got it but this was not the company’s fault I ordered it from
"
Rob,3.0,2020 12 January,"
Pleased with the PS4 Pro it’s a great piece of kit can’t fault it.  5 stars.The packaging though is pretty poor and that’s being kind. 2 stars.  A cardboard box that was wet and torn.  The filling of the box to prevent items becoming damaged was a folded piece of cardboard.  My items box was damaged.Luckily there was no damage to the PlayStation.Great item, packaging need improvement.
"
Mad Mark,5.0,2019 12 October,"
Had my old, first generation PS4 for six years but, for the second time, it started spitting out my discs so thought it was time for a upgrade. Should've got the Pro years ago!! Much more room for storage! Much more powerful! I only have a 24 inch 1080p TV and the visual quality is a vast step up (no doubt even more so on a 4K.) The PS4 Pro has been worth every penny. Highly recommended!
"
Christophe Di Bartolo,5.0,2021 13 May,"
Just upgraded to PRO. Lovin' it so far. The performance and visual aspects increase are quite big. I am not in a rush to switch to PS5
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 5 June,"
Absolute excellent!It's a great console. Quiet, fast and looks sleek and good.Despite not having a 4K TV I went with the Pro due to the extra 500gb of memory. And it's worth it. With games like Modern Warfare taking 128gb I can see how it fills up fast!Would 100% recommend this console.

Terry Miles,3.0,2020 29 April,"
Item arrived very quickly. Thanks. So no complaints regarding the supplier but the console itself is such a disappointment. Games take an age to install from discs. Even worse some insist you download and install updates before playing. Just tedious. I can’t remember having all this trouble with the PS3. Very unhappy.
"

Perfect. replaced a faulty one I bought from game 2 days earlier and had to fight to return as it wouldn't load any games. This was perfect condition and works 100x better than my old ps4.
"
Gary1975,5.0,2020 8 February,"
This is my first console in years,so for a complete novice, I love it! For me this is a big step up, the graphics are amazing, with a huge selection of games, and I've just been introduced to VR which this console can do, and it blew me away. So I give this full stars!

"
Kindle Customer,5.0,2020 16 August,"
Great bit of kit, just as each & every rendition has been a step or two, above the previous system, this is good, but you need to choose the best games that you have a interest in.
"
Louis,2.0,2021 27 August,"
The product it's self is good however the delivery driver dropped the package over a 5ft gate instead of delivering it to the door. This caused minor cosmetic damage to the product , fortunately the console and controller function ok
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 30 January,"
I know its not the PS5 but my son absolutely loves this playstation 4 PRO... loads of storage so will own for a long time
"
Val,1.0,2020 1 April,"
I will describe my experience with the product in detail:1. Tried to connect JBL Boombox as a speaker. Device not supported2. Tried to connect Bose Soundsport headphones. Device not supported3. Tried to connect my Logitech MX Master mouse. Device not supported.4. Connected my Apple Magic Mouth - worked, wooow. Only the first time though. After reboot the Magic Mouse is in the list of devices and when I press connect it times out. If I try to delete it from the list of devices, the PS4 crashes and asks me to send a bug report. Really? Rebooted, tried again and PS4 completely froze. I had to force-reboot it. Amazing experience...For people wondering which external devices to buy - buy only cable connected devices, whether it's a keyboard, mouth or speaker. Also, google before buying devices whether they're supported.Shame on Sony for not supporting such common and basic external devices.
"
mrs,1.0,2021 25 January,"
I purchased this console as New, it was a gift for my husbands christmas but which sadly did  not play games and after a couple of hours didn't go into safe mode and a few more hours later didn't even come up on the screen.  He contactedd sony in the hope of getting a fix for it but was instead told that the console was over two years old, had run out of warranty and was preowned............was furious as I paid £409.  for what I thought was a new unit, there was nothing on the amazon page to indicate this was secondhand, however, they promptly refunded my money.  The seller was Monster Bid Ltd.  The product had it be new would probably have been fine.

"
Malick Doucouré,1.0,2020 14 August,"
I’ve been a great amazon customer for years, probably spent thousands so I’m really disappointed to have received what feels like a faulty product.I bought this PS Pro 6 weeks ago and it’s already broken. Six weeks. I bought it with a game and a controller from amazon, the game was fine but the controller was faulty and immediately unusable. Amazon have me a refund for this, I should’ve sent back the PlayStation too. It was a bit weird but I don’t complain if it’s not necessary so I went on with it, only for the HDMI port to have stopped working on me 6 weeks later.Really really disappointed, I think I might go to GAME or someone other than amazon for my big purchases now since they never disappoint.

Nick Boan,1.0,2022 4 January,"
it seems to be over heating and is very noisy and would not be surprised if it broke down any minute. Sometimes it doesn't turn on when its supposed to. The HDMI cable doesn't seem to connect to my new TV very well and also the controller wire doesn't work. Not very impressed at all.

"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 6 November,"
Takes the PS4 and adds more options and combustibility to your games, Say you prefer Performance over graphics or maybe you'll happily take a hit to the frame rate for the game to like prettier.. This console has you sorted.
"
Pedro,1.0,2021 13 December,"
I would like to inform Amazon that the console controller is not in proper condition - PS4. In addition to wear marks, the button on the left-hand side does not function correctly. I would like to have the remote control replaced as soon as possible. I remember that your information on this item was that it was in excellent condition.

The Chinese/English language on the box had me worried for a second, but it is the same quality PS4 Pro one would purchase brand new at any electronics store in Canada (if they were no longer discontinued). Works fine as it should and it definitely plays well in 4K HDR (and supersampling mode if you have a lower quality TV). The pricing is indeed over the top, but you will get your money's worth.

"
patralink,5.0,2020 4 August,"
I am a clean freak and have used many different mops over the years.  This is the best mop I've ever used and I love it.  It's the spinning action that makes it so great.  When you put the mop in the soap and water you then activate the spinner (think salad spinner) with your foot and all the excess water comes out of it.  The floor dries quicker.  Also the mop head is substancial and does a super job cleaning.  Evidence is in the dirty water you pour out of the bucket at the end.  People have complained abou the handle being too short.  That's because it is lengthened at both ends.  Once you know this you can make it the proper length.  If you lengthen only at one end of the handle it will be very short.
"
Carol A. Balazs,5.0,2022 20 February,"
These replacement mop heads are so much better than the original that came with the mop and bucket.  They are smaller and easy to work with.  Easy to clean.

"
Natalie C. ,5.0,2021 20 July,"
I purchased these as a replacement for the mopping pads that were included when I first bought the mop as a set at Costco; all though these are a little different in color from the original ones that were included with the mop, the quality is still great! To clean them, I throw them in a quick clean cycle in my washer!
"
Terrence (T-Money),4.0,2021 10 August,"
Mop worth having as it goes the job. Durable…absorbs well. Need to change every month I find. Worth the purchase.

"
goofball,5.0,2021 22 May,"
The house cleaner that does my home uses this O'Ceadar unit and loves it like crazy. This mophead replacement works just as nice as the original at first, and it just keeps getting better. Talk about a super clean floor, here ya go. Highly recommended to those interested. sorry, the camera is broken on the phone.
"
dace,2.0,2022 31 July,"
This item is not interchangeable with the OCedar mop head with the single spin chamber.  The mounting bracket on the mop head is too large and so will not fit.
"
Frank,5.0,2021 12 May,"
This spin mop system is the best. Makes cleaning floors a breeze. These replacement heads fit perfectly. Easy to use and clean. Durable. Absorbency is super. We love this system so much we have one for the upstairs and another down. You will not be disappointed.
"
sierra salgado,5.0,2021 26 October,"
Easy to use but a couple of the heads were not clicking onto the stick
"
Kellie,2.0,2022 24 June,"
These mop heads are much thinner than the ones being sold last year. When mopping these mopheads are extremely thin, barely cover the red triangle portion of the mop which kept scratching the floor. Defintely not the same quality. Will not purchase again.
"
Lainey love,5.0,2021 18 December,"
As described
"
Sarah Scott,5.0,2020 13 March,"
I have been in love with the Ocedar spin mop for about 2 years now. I actually own 2 of the sets. The only downfall was, there is no physical store anywhere near me that sells the replacement heads. Product was as expected (though I always love a new head!) Price is reasonable given the convience of online ordering and was at my door in 3 days (late weekend ordering). 5 stars for this Product and overall brand
"
Costum,5.0,2021 19 August,"
Easy to use and very absorbent. Difficult to fully clean, which makes it great that they are replaceable.
"
Savana Bishop,3.0,2021 10 August,"
This product is okay. It works well on my mop, but it seems like it doesn't get clean after one use. I throw it in the washing machine and let it air-dry, but it always seems to have hairs, lint, etc, still stuck in it. I usually opt for a Swiffer instead.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 5 October,"
Will buy again, Perfect for my O cedar mop
"
jdial2007,5.0,2020 12 March,"
I had bought a replacement head at Walmart, and it must have been defective. It wouldn't stay on my mop no matter how hard we tried to make it. It would snap in, and the second the weight of the water was in, it fell off. These are exactly what I needed for my OCedar spin mop! They're just like the original, and about $3ea cheaper than in store!
"
Brenda,5.0,2021 7 February,"
These are great for my O-Cedar Easy Ring mop.  I have two small dogs and clean up is so easy with this mop.  I can just throw in washer and pop another one on mop for cleaning next room.
"
tessa carlock,5.0,2021 1 October,"
Perfect for the o cedar mop
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2021 10 August,"
These are fluffy but not like original ones. My problem is they continually come off the mop handle snd have to be snapped back on. They do mop well. Just not what you’d expect to receive. Aggravating to use at times.
"
Brian,5.0,2021 15 October,"

Laura Banta,5.0,2020 18 June,"
I bought this mop during the Corona virus lock down when I laid off my house keeper. It is a really great mop. Afterwards I throw it in the washer and let it air dry! Very please with this product--a far cry from the old rag mops I used to use!!
"
Yvonne,4.0,2020 25 December,"
These are not like the ones that came with my mop.  They're ok, but not great.
"
Babette,5.0,2020 18 August,"
I like that I can get refills for the mop online So many times I have bought a mop from a big  store and when I need a refill they don’t carry the refills. I bought the mop online and these refills too.
"
Sue,5.0,2021 18 February,"
I really like that I can switch out mop heads for different jobs and that spinning the mop helps me control how much water I use on the surface.
"
hannahRAWR,3.0,2021 1 January,"
I've found that these heads do not have enough fiber on them to clean the floors without the plastic scraping and having to stop and readjust. I have also found that the debris is hard to come out even after multiple washes. They look worn and dirty quickly and at the rate that you would need to purchase new heads, you might be better off investing in a different mop or method.
"
SHELLY Elderdice,5.0,2021 12 May,"
Cleaning houses and the best part is you can just throw the mop head in the washer.
"
MzJones,5.0,2019 30 September,"
I am a mopping fool!! Not only do I have pets but I clean for therapy... I’m sure I’m not alone!😬 this mop is sturdy. I purchased the wringer and replacement heads. So fR , I haven’t had to change out the head. I soak in bleach and hard chemicals (mr clean , 409) to clean 2x a week and it’s still looking good
"
Judy M. Hoya,5.0,2021 18 April,"

This works great. It’s so easy to use. I don’t have to get dirty from the mop water because it really does wring itself with the bucket. Easy clean up. Easy storage. Just plain easy for me in every way and does a great cleaning job. Yes I definitely recommend this product.
"

"
Kindle Customer,5.0,2020 1 March,"
Sometimes you have to think why didn’t I  invented this product. I use it for mopping, dusting and cleaning all types of surfaces. Excellent, for bathroom walls with no need of using hands or bending my back. Highly,  recommend for individuals with limited range of motion.
"
Katzzz,5.0,2020 9 May,"
I love this mop...as much as you can love a mop. I ordered extra replacement mop heads because I wash them after each use. These were a great price per mop head, a lot cheaper than buying a single replacement at Walmart.
"

"
LoveTheMidniteSunAK220,1.0,2018 12 January,"
I must say that I was more then just a tad bit disappointed with the mop heads I received. Under no circumstances do these mop heads appear to be genuine O-Cedar mop heads. When I purchased the O-Cedar Mop and bucket I was utterly amazed as to how well made the mop and the bucket was made. The first time I used the mop and bucket set I couldn't believe how well the mop absorbed so I got on Amazon and bought the Pack of 3 EasyWring Spin Mop Refill that claims it's made by O-Cedar. It took me a few months before opening the package simply because the original mop head was so well made there was no reason for me to open it. When I first opened the bag I thought for sure Amazon had sent me the wrong mop head, the mop was so poorly put together I thought that maybe there was just one in the bag that was just a fluke but all 3 were pure garbage. The mops were not very absorbent, whenever you pushed the mop across the floor the plastic that the mop is attached to scratched across the floor as if there was no mop attached. I am really disappointed with what I got. I am now back to using the original mop head till I can figure out where I can buy a mop head that is a genuine O-Cedar. My honest opinion is that the package of 3 that I received is not an O-Cedar it's something else inside an O-Cedar bag. How can I order new mop heads if I don't know that the advertisement is truthful or not? Any ideas?
"
Beverly J Miller,5.0,2020 3 October,"

These are not the same refills you purchase in stores.  These replacement mop heads do not appear to be as good of quality and I will be returning.
"
pattyb,4.0,2017 1 July,"
I liked these pretty much, but when they get grungy from mopping floors, they don't hand-wash very well.  Even with Oxy-clean and Tide, they wouldn't whiten up.  And though it says you can machine wash them, my machine is too new for me to have these plastic triangle things banging around in the washtub.  But, still, a good product.
"
Susan Weber,5.0,2019 1 July,"
I've been shopping Amazon for everything lately looking for ways to save money and this is just such a purchase. Where I get the O cedar replacement heads, they go for $7.00 buying these they price out to $5.00 per head. 3 total. No noticeable difference than the ones from the store.

Amazon Customer,2.0,2018 21 May,"
The quality of this three pack was not nearly as good as the previous four pack I purchased.  My cleaning lady was very disappointed in this latest shipment. They are flimsy and do not appear to be washable.  Unfortunately, I was not told of her dislike until today.  I purchased these for our home in Pennsylvania, and I live in Arkansas. I have never been unhappy with anything I have bought o Amazon,  Not sure about the process to return.  Please advise.

These are a waste of time, but i had already purchased these before my new bigger better spin mop was given to me. This mop just seems to be too small for the mopping i need to do.

Melissa F,1.0,2021 30 September,"
These do not fit! They are not a genuine O-Cedar item. I missed the return window as I didnt need to replace the one I had been using. But then while it was washing, a mess was made so I opened these up. That's when I realized they were not true O-Cedar and they didn't fit. In the trash they go. Don't waste your money.

"
Jess44,2.0,2018 19 April,"
Had purchased these last year and the one I bought before were more fluffy and maintained the fluffiness when wet. These that I recently purchased became very stringy and had to be thrown out after about 3 uses when they usually last longer.  Total waste. Hopefully the quality will improve again.

Does the job, but compared to the original mob, these are super thin and light, lack friction because of this. I wish they were just like the first mop head. In the picture, the original is the left one, the one on the mop is this product.

barbclay,1.0,2018 3 June,"
Wasn't sure if I'd even like this mop when I bought refills, but the mop has been great!  Very easy to replace/refill.  I love that it spins extra water out so that the floor (esp wood) doesn't get too wet.  Nice concept.  However, these refills are NOT the same as those that came with the mop.  Very thin & stringy, I would NOT purchase these refill mop heads!
"
ACast6,1.0,2018 19 January,"
These are not the same as the original mop. It’s  so thin and nothing compared to the quality of the one the bucket system comes with. I purchased them because they are the “Amazon Recommended” the is the first item I purchase and have been disappointed with.

"
curlyq,1.0,2018 20 March,"
Nothing like the mop head that came with the mop.  The strings ball up and we can't even mop with it.  Not sure if we can order something similar that came with the actual mop.  If not, we will have to just trash the current mop and bucket.  No way can we use these.
"
MJ Alfaro,1.0,2018 7 February,"
I’m extremely disappointed in this product. The thread is very this and long which makes it very difficult to mop. The one that came with the mop is nice and fluffy so the actual mop doesn’t touch the floor. If I would’ve known I would’ve bought a generic brand. Do not recommend it.
"
Cathryn D.,1.0,2018 17 February,"
The quality of these are terrible. The mop yarn is flimsy and much thinner than the normal o-cedar mop head.  It was so thin and flimsy that it was getting caught up underneath and the plastic was scraping against my floor. I do not recommend purchasing as it was a poor, cheap imitation.
"
D,1.0,2018 9 September,"
JUNK!!  The original heads with the mop were good. There are useless.  Flop over exposing the frame and scratching the floor.  And costs too much to bother returning.  DONT"" BUY. Too bad no zero for evaluation.
"
R. Stirewalt,1.0,2018 27 March,"
They suck!  I was so disappointed. They are not the mop  you buy in the store. You have to work twice as hard to clean because they are so thin with material. Buy the ones in the store.these are not worth it.

Not a O-Cedar product, cheap knock off in an unmarked clear plastic bag, the material is light weight and cheap. look elsewhere.
"
ED,1.0,2017 4 September,"
We thought these refills would work but they do not wring water well and hard to dry wood flooring. Appear to be different in material compared to the original mops. Almost like turning to mush when wet and bad absorption.
"
jtounurse,1.0,2018 9 March,"
These are terrible!!!!! Nothing like what came with the mop. They look fine, but when placed in water they string to strings that don’t clean at all!!!! Where are the ones that came with the mop!?!??

I have a luxury vinyl floor, and used a dry pad, followed with by a wet pad, but always got streaks. I noticed my sister in law using the O cedar mop, and thought no way. I reluctantly bought one and couldn’t be happier. No streaks, and cleans great! Have extra pads on hand. Just toss them  into the laundry and reuse.

We ordered this to use with the Bissell Spot Clean Pro Portable Deep Cleaning machine for multi purpose use. The Spot & Stain with Oxy worked great to remove light stains on our cream colored microfiber sofas, for spot cleaning entry rugs and kitchen runner, on our vehicle floors & mats, upholstered bar stool fabric, and carpeted stairs. Arrived promptly. A small amount goes a long way with this cleaning solution you mix with water. Have a sensitive nose and found the scent to be mild, not overbearing, pleasant compared to many others. Would purchase again and recommend!
"
S. Pappas,5.0,2022 19 October,"
I own a few STRs and often have spot cleaning that is necessary when people spill things which became far too frequent and I got tired of dragging out the big shampooer ever week so I got a Bissell handheld. I was wondering if it would really work very well since there was not hot water used but when with this product its amazing. This cleaner takes out 95% of all the stains we've had including gummy bears ground into the carpet.
"
Christine,4.0,2022 25 October,"
I used this one time and realize that using white vinegar, baking soda and dawn dish soap (occasionally) works better than this product to clean. It's nice, but I think it's cheaper and better to use natural products, but that's my opinion.

Redneckyup,4.0,2022 4 July,"
I bought this unit for my RV. By choice, I live in it. It is a 1995. I bought this for the upholstery and carpet. Probably never been deep cleaned before. I have used multiple carpet cleaners over the years and IMO the concentrated cleaner you use is very important. Though the Bissell cleaner works fine, I have found 5 guys upholstery cleaner and Oreck are the best I have used so far.  The primary reason I write this review is concerning the sprayer. Obviously the sprayer should spray in a fan like design and not squirt. Mine began to squirt two streams. One on each side. After reading questions and reviews I found that this was not uncommon with many returning the unit. I looked closely at my spray nozzle and saw a very tiny white spec in the center. At first I thought this must be part of the design. I then took a toothpick and flicked it out. The spray function then fanned as it should have in the first place. I figured the white spec must have been a remnant from the manufacture of the solution tub. Anyway, the unit works fine now. This is just my second day using it and I have a lot of square feet of upholstery, carpet and yes carpeted ceiling to clean so I will try and update this review once I am done.
"
CalvinL,5.0,2022 3 October,"
This is actually the best Bissell solution I’ve used. It’s more effective at removing scents than the urine remover. I primarily use this for my cats messes but occasionally for my drunk friends sleeping on my couch.

My saving grace used with my bissell upholstery cleaning machine. I have a cream couch with 2 toddlers, 2 cats, 2 dogs and a husband who loves eating snacks on the couch. It’s the only reason I get compliments on how clean the couch is!! The smell is clean and not over bearing or bothersome to my allergies either.

I got this for my little green machine because me and my kid are messy sometimes. We've spilled milk and formula on our new fabric couch that's a taupe color. My last straw was when I spilled Kool aid. This cleaning solution did not change any color of the fabric, smells like a weird Kool aid itselfwhich is kind of good, and easily cleans like it should.  I'll definitely buy more when I run out. I have also used it on a bean bag and spots on an area rug, both got clean easily.

An ink pen leaked onto the couch, leaving what looked like seven stars in a constellation, with a few shooting stars.  I used this formula in a Bissell handheld portable wet/dry vac.  The stain was slowly coming out, with repeated attempts to remove it.  I think it was the peroxide in the Oxiclean in the formula that made my skin burn, where I'd had a couple of those winter-dry-skin cracks on my hands.  I took the cushion outside and hosed it down until no more soap bubbled up out of the cushion.  I'm glad I was the one to feel that sting, rather than our puppy or today's 5 year old visitor.  So, I'd say for stubborn but gradually lightening stains, it's wise to rinse this product off between attempts to remove a really bad ink stain.  This product removed an old dog urine stain from the carpet with only one attempt.  Same with a greasy, black stain out of the fairly light colored carpet by the front door.  Gone on the first attempt.

we don't walk on the carpet with shoes. when i need the cleaner, it is for a spill or annual deep clean. this has worked well on a lot of stuff. once had a digiorno pizza upside down and while that took a lot of time, and the pro told me good luck, it did come out with patience (red dye in food can be a nightmare). i will continue to buy this.

Had a nasty spill on the carpet in my mini-van, and had tried many other products to get the stain and smell out, but to limited success.  Bought this oxy cleaner as my last ditch effort to purge the van of the awful smell/stain, and to my surprise, it worked very well.  I used a portable rug cleaner, made sure the water was 130 degrees (the max temp. for the device), sprayed the Oxy cleaner on the carpet, scrubbed, let is sit for awhile, then vacuumed the excess.  Just the first pass alone showed it made a huge dent in both the stain and the smell.  Two more repeated passes reduced the stain by 95% plus and completely eliminated the odor.  There seemed to be a minimum of residue remaining, though having a quality vacuum cleaner designed for such purposes is equally important (used the Hoover Spotless Mini Carpet-Pet Cleaner).I would prefer if they could make the product without any perfumes (I am assuming there is something added) and that it was on the pricey side as I went through two bottles quite rapidly.  I would suggest making a larger economical size.In the end, this is now my go to deep carpet cleaner, especially for vehicles.

There is nothing wrong with the product, cleans up my pet’s mess nicely. However, this delivery came under my husbands name, not mine. I don’t know how that happened since we do not share Amazon accounts. Had this been  a gift… yikes.

Robert T.,5.0,2022 28 March,"
I bought this along with the Bissell spot cleaner machine, and I am very glad I did.  The 8 oz. bottle of cleaner that comes with the Bissell spot cleaner is used up fast, so you really need to buy this larger bottle too.  The scent is nice and is easy to apply and remove (only a small fraction of the cleaning solution applied can be vacuumed up, and I think that is why the cleaned surface stays wet for longer than expected).  If possible, clean the item and let it dry overnight, and it should be dry that next day.

"
Mystic,5.0,2020 18 April,"
I’m not sure why all these people posting reviews think your suppose to just dump the entire dang thing in the machine.... I dunno what machines other folks are using but I have a spot bot, with little line indicators on the water container dohickey for how much water to add, and how much solution to add. And lemme tell ya, you only need a small portion of what it calls for as long as ur water is hot from the tap. I’m talking like.. 1/4 to maybe even 1/8th of a cup, and the rest water..This works brilliantly! I have a cat with vomiting issues. And she recently got a bad tooth, so isn’t eating enough and I have to give her soft food while I’m waiting to get her mouth fixed. Meanwhile the other cats keep eating all the grain free soft food I have for her (since she also pukes WAY more w wheat food), and if I don’t specifically hang w her in the bathroom regularly so she can eat in peace, she’ll go too long with no food and puke this dark brown bile stuff all over.... soo hard to get out of the carpet until this miracle bottle showed up!! Just a little mixed w hot water and the spot bot does the rest. I tried a few other things prior to getting this on 2 Of the areas I couldn’t completely eradicate no matter what.. and even on the most stubborn spots, this got it out 100%. Thank you bissel!! Only issue now is despite using the surface stain setting, I have several much cleaner round spots on my carpet in walkway areas.. demonstrating how soo over due we are for a full carpet cleaning lol

Meet Frank the terror! He loves to lounge on my upholstery.

You can purchase these items for less than one cleaning company visit.The best part of it…you will have your cleaning kit for years!

Not sure about instantly removing stains but it is good when you pretreat with it a little stronger 1st then shampoo with the solution as directed.  It smells clean.  Not a strong scent.  I don't like perfumy cleaners so this was much better. This size bottle should last a while for my portable shampooer.  Also I got some solution on my hands and couldn't rinse right away....I didn't have any irriation.  I feel like this product is safe for people and pets.

Got this from Amazon because they didn't have it at our local Walmart, where we bought the machine. It works fine; nothing special but nothing to complain about. I didn't have to spend much time on the stains before they lifted out. If I remember correctly it seemed to come out after the first soak and removal. Will buy again for sure.
"
c.mac,5.0,2021 14 March,"
FYI when they ship these, there is a “Gripper” sticker around the cap so it prevents leaks when you get this product delivered. I use this with my portable Bissell Pet Stain Eraser machine and it cleans all stains, even on THICK and shaggy carpet. It works on cleaning up dog vomit or urine. It even works if stains have been there for a couple of days. The scent of the cleaner is refreshing and gets rid of any nasty smell that was previously there. This Oxy stuff is potent and it’s not only for pet stains, but the bottle says you can also use it on wine, coffee, and soda.  Haven’t tried it yet on those, but it definitely works for pet stains!!

Megan,4.0,2021 30 March,"
I love this thing! I have a long haired cat who gets a lot of hairballs and coughs them up on my carpet. I don’t have enough carpet to justify buying an upright Bissell so I bought this instead. It’s easy to clean and put back together. The battery lasts for a lot of uses. Only downfall is that the part where you put in the cleaner leaks and has since the first use. For that reason I’m giving 4 stars. My solution has been to put the cleaning solution into a spray bottle and spray the area I’m cleaning, then use the Bissell to suck it up. Works fine for me!

I thought I was going to need to replace my carpet.  I used every carpet cleaner I could get my hands on.  I even tried vinegar and baking soda, hydrogen peroxide as recommended by the pros.  Nothing worked and I was about to give up. Then I used Bissell Spot and Stain and the spot immediately went away.  The only con about this product is that I rinse it which takes a little longer because I feel that if I don't there's a residue left behind.

After watching YT videos about formulas for cleaning upholstery, I decided to try this instead. I used it in an old SpotBot with VERY hot water. It took an old grease stain out of my seat with a single pass, and made my light colored fabric look fresh and clean.
"
Asia,5.0,2020 21 May,"
I used this shampoo in my Bissell upwright shampooer and it worked like magic. I used this shampoo on the first half of my room with really bad stains from really old cat and dog pee, and beer stains from previous renters and then I used the different shampoo that came with my Bissell once I ran out of this and that shampoo did not work the same as this at all. So I'm gunna buy like 6 more of these because I like it so much. I also wasn't even intentionally looking for a smell and after shampooing a few rows of my carpet I thought, ""this smells really nice I can appreciate it"". Definitely recommend this but if you have a big space to shampoo(like mine in the pics) I'd get a few of these bottles to cover it all because it goes quick.
"
mandy,5.0,2021 1 December,"
We bought this to clean some really dirty carpets. When we ran out we bought a different brand. That brand just spread dirt, made the carpets look worse, and left a weird feel to the carpets. Bought this Bissell again and was able to clean up the mess the other left behind.

I bought this as a way to clean up after my cat, who has issues with vomiting on occasion.  In the past, I was never happy with cleaners in a spray can, as they did not always get the staining out completely.  The Bissel l is excellent for this.  It goes deep into carpeting and pulls up any residual staining.  It is small so can be easily stored and charged.  I am glad I found this product.

I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this product due to the negative reviews mentioning leaking, poor suction, etc. I find this unit to be extremely efficient with good suction and have had no issues with leakage when used as directed.  This replaces for me a $250..00 upright cleaner by another manufacturer which was cumbersome, DID leak and was impossible to clean  A lot of good engineering went into this product.

I purchased this product to help with my elderly cat who gets sick more frequently. He just got sick on our microfiber couch and I was so happy that I had just ordered and received a bottle of this product. The couch stain came out beautifully and seems to have taken the odor out. My only comment is that the scent was very light or almost non existent when mixed with water so it didn’t smell much like cleaner. This product did also got out an old stain in our carpet that I have tried 3 other cleaning products on.

M. Semones,4.0,2020 21 April,"
This product is good for my little green machine but it doesn't go very far in usage.  Couldn't find a concentrated one so  bought three of these.  Ended up I've got to order more because this doesn't go very far.  Took two bottles to clean the front seat of my medium size car which wasn't very soiled.  It did the job very well, but think it's too expensive to have to use it right out of the bottle.  Should have a concentrated  upholstery cleaning product for the Little Green Machine.

But, does one have a choice? This is made specifically for the unit.I gave it a very hard task. We had a buildup of muck from foot wounds in the carpet. I had to pretreat twice, not because this didn't work but because the muck was that bad. Combining the use of this product with the use of the brush, the muck was completely removed and the pile of the carpet was restored as much as possible in a high traffic area. Restored to where it was before the muck occurred.

So they want me to mention the scent, easy to use, and thickness. OK if this product has any thickness to it, toss it. It’s supposed to be a spray, to clean up dog or cat urine.  This spray works great in the machine by Bissell that it is made for.  It is a refill.Sometimes some of the things they want us to mention don’t fit the description whatsoever to the product.

The carpet though, I figured buying a new rug would be easier. But I already invested in all this cleaning stuff so why not try. The puke was lumpy, deep orange, sticky, and covered a good 12x12 inch patch of the carpet. Well this solution cleaned the carpet area so well it’s clear I have to clean the whole rug now.

I used this as soon as it was delivered. My daughter threw up right on the livingroom carpet. We have light colored carpet and not to give you a bad image but her vomit was sooooo orange colored. I already have a Boswell spot cleaner for this purpose and it for it out of the carpet with just 2 rounds of spray, sit and scrub. I highly recommend!!  It also has a light decent scent. The last one I purchased smelled like chemicals but this specific one doesn’t. It has a light clean smell.
"
Dan,5.0,2020 24 August,"
I use this all of the time in my little portable Bissell to clean up cat pee and vomit on carpet. It leaves a fresh scent and does a great job. You may have to go over a particularly soiled area twice but that's normal.  Also, I don't use a separate oxy solution so I fill up my tank up to the marked water or oxy line, then fill up the rest with this solution. Does the trick every time.
"

I love this product!Very easy to use, all you have to do is remove the little film and pour into your machine. It last me a good bit, too!

This solution does exactly what you need it to do.

This works so well on carpets, rugs and upholstery! It removes the dirt/soiling and leaves it smelling clean and fresh. A must when using the Bissell Little Green machine (also a phenomenal product!). If you have kids or pets or both you need this.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 The product containers would not stand up - the bottom was rounded on both bottles.  Was not happy with that for the fact that laying down the bottles may leak.

A. White,5.0,2021 3 August,"
We just wanted to give it a shot and it really has blown our mind. It works so great! Stains that were on our couch for years just came out! Just make sure to use warm water
"
James,3.0,2021 22 November,"
Good but not worth the money. Considering how much you need to clean a carpet it’s nuts. Just get an off brand that works just as well and half the price
"
A. VANDREUMEL,5.0,2019 12 July,"
You know those gross orange stains you get on your carpet when your cat throws up? This gets that out. I have a Bissell spot bot that gets a lot of use unfortunately, and I have always used this with it.  I don’t use the full amount it says to use and it still works fine. I find it a little pricey although Amazon has the best price generally.  I wish it had a fresher scent,  but whatever that smell is, it dissipates quickly.  Overall not a bad product and I will definitely keep re-purchasing as long as I have cats that have hairballs, which will probably be forever.
"
Patrick,5.0,2021 17 January,"
Bought this solution for my Bissell portable cleaner and it works wonders. I mainly use it to detail my car but I have used it on my sofa with no issues. I recommend agitating heavily soiled areas after solution is applied. I try to keep at least two bottles of this in the house at all times.
"
H Penz,4.0,2019 9 September,"
I borrowed a Bissell vac from a friend and needed to replace the solution that I used. It works with the Bissell line of vacuums but it is definitely greasy/oily feeling kind of like if you use way too much fabric softener. I learned you can use hot water, a bit of dish soap, vinegar and a little bit of baking soda to make your own solution. Needless to say, I had to replace the bottle I used up so here we are.

I have always had Bissell carpet shampooers and I also have the wonderful Spot Bot.  Beings I have 3 dogs and 1 cat  There are always accidents once in a while and this product is Is the best to use in the spot bot.

Beverly Martin,5.0,2021 25 August,"
We have two dogs who drag in dirt from our property constantly. This cleaner has been a carpet saver. It really cleans the spots right up.

If you have a Spot Bot this is the only product to use.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 7 July,"
I ordered the spot bot with this solution because we bought new carpet and have dogs.. I have to say it works amazing for all clean ups! I’m totally blown away by the cleaning ability!!! Highly recommended..👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼

Soltra89,4.0,2020 8 April,"
Spent $7ish dollars on this for my little green project. I used it to clean my entire couch and filled my tank twice. There are still plenty of uses left in it. It also got out the blue slime that was stuck on the sheet. I just sprayed it and let it soak then cleaned that area last.
"
Christopher,5.0,2021 18 September,"
Bought this to get some stains out of an old couch. Worked perfectly and leaves a beautiful scent behind.
"
Maria,1.0,2022 29 March,"
The actual product is ok, but I don't recommend ordering it from Amazon. The sticker sealing the bottle is not the best so it splilled inside the amazon bag and I lost a lot of product.Then when I took it out, it got on my hand. I didn't rinse it immediately bc the label didn't say anything about it being dangerous to skin. About 5 mins later my hand started  getting hot and itching. I saw white spots on it and assumed the product had dried on my skin...not the case. When i went to wash my hands I took a closer look and realized it was my skin. It was rising up like blisters. I kept rinseing and scrubbing my hand for a long time until it felt ok. A day or two later I scrapped that skin off with a pumus stone and my skin is growing back ok. I immediately returned the product and got a refund from Amazon.Its an ok product, just don't order it here
"
Tyler Heacox,4.0,2021 21 March,"
I was hoping the cleaner would make a larger difference than it did. Definitely cleaned the area but I was hoping for a deeper clean.

John Ebsen,4.0,2021 12 January,"
My Bissell Pet Stain Eraser is a voracious user of fluid.  Can use 16 oz. on a single cleanup.  The fluid itself works fine and does not leave an odor.

ActiveShopperGal,5.0,2020 6 March,"
I tried the sample cleaning solution that came with my portable Bissell clean - which yielded an average result. Then I changed to the Bissell Professional Spot and Stain + Oxy Portable Machine Formula and got a STELLAR CLEANING RESULT and fresh, clean scent. In both cases, I pre-treated stained areas for 5 minute as per instructions. I will definitely purchase Bissell Professional Spot and Stain + Oxy Portable Machine Formula again.

ashley,5.0,2021 5 November,"

"
Deth,5.0,2021 14 June,"
For some reason Amazon is request I review the spot cleaner, cleaning solution, and combo package as 3 separate reviews instead of just the combo (you know, the one I bought?) but it's all good stuff.
"
shirley stevens,5.0,2021 9 November,"
It works great fast shipping
"
A.A,5.0,2020 15 December,"
Yes! It works well even without the expensive Bissell machine. All you need is a spray bottle and light Dilute it with warm water. And spray do a little scrub and you’re good to go. It really does work without the machine. Give it a try you guys.
"
Shawn Overman,3.0,2021 25 October,"
The scent smells good but I don’t feel like it cleaned my spot that great and it still smells like pee
"
Chris & Nicole,5.0,2018 12 March,"
This cleaner came with a handheld spot carpet cleaner that I have.  I had to re-order another bottle because I used it so much, and it worked so well.  The treated areas do not end up hard or looking any different.  I have been using it to clean spots of cat pee and it has been very effective in removing the stain and the smell, which is no easy task.  I will continue to use this with my bissell spot cleaner and I would highly recommend this to anyone.  I have used it on white carpet and brown carpet, and it worked great on both without discoloring or damaging.
"
Roy A. Jones,4.0,2020 18 October,"
I bought this by accident but used it anyway in my full size Bissell Pro . It did exactly what I wanted, cleaning the carpet and removing all the stains.
"
Ana,5.0,2017 20 September,"
I have a spot cleaning machine also by Bissell. The sample liquid that came with it is much better than this even though this one claims to have Oxy boost to help you lift off stains. It definitely lifted the stains I had on my carpet. The dirtier area is still noticeably dirty. They ask you to check a section of the carpet in case this cleaner changes the color, I skipped that step so I'm not sure if the extra whiteness is color change or actually how well the carpet was cleaned, in combination with an Oxyclean product my partner used prior to me using this with the cleaner. No strong smell which I appreciate. I'm happy!
"
🧑🏾‍🚀 KNASA,3.0,2021 2 June,"
It works, but it doesnt really leave a good smell. It doesnt leave a bad one.. just doesnt leave a good one, when my couch dries is kind of smells like air dried clothes. But it got the job done i just spray fabreeze after it dries to add a smell. Also it’s expensive for its size. I use the whole bottle to clean the couches and rug once
"
A. Smith,5.0,2021 10 August,"
There is no need for mixing etc.  This does a great job on dog spills and throw-ups.

Has a house with animals in it… This is an absolute must! The best purchase I’ve made in years! I no longer get angry or upset at my Chihuahua… I simply pull out my Bissell and clean up the mess! Bravo
"
quinn walker,5.0,2020 2 October,"
This stuff is so good! There is little to no sent and it really cleans. I use it in my pet stain remover handheld vacuum to clean up a few piddle stains from my puppy, and afterwards the spot smells fresh and clean and all the urine smell is gone!
"
Shelley Desind,5.0,2021 17 October,"
Great cleaning Product!
"
Adrienne,5.0,2021 19 March,"
Has a nice smell, cleans carpet stains very well. Usually we are cleaning dog urine with it. We scrub with a Bissell pet stain eraser then suck up all the liquid. Works well together.
"
PD,5.0,2020 24 December,"
I bought this product to clean the carpet in my basement. And boy did it do a great job?  I couldn’t believe how quickly it cleaned out all the dirt and spots. My carpet has a new lease on life now.
"
gr8hnd,5.0,2017 28 November,"
This stuff works. That’s what I like the most. What I like the least is, it gets used up really fast. It would be  so expensive to use often. But it works and it does what it says it will do.  It is not appropriate to place a number of other cleaning agents in the spot cleaners and so one has to be careful with what is put in there. That puts a bit of a difficult situation on the consumer, since we can’t go out and buy anything cheaper then the Bissell products. Still, I love the machine and this solution is perfect.
"
JesSca,5.0,2020 29 May,"
I've used this to get puke, red wine and dog accidents out of the rug.  I am gratefully left with absolutely no remnants or stains! I've used it with Bissells pet spot eraser.  However, I wish they would sell one more concentrated you can mix with water as the bottle seems to go quickly.
"
Chloe Jane,5.0,2019 11 April,"
My elderly cat will barf up some nasty colored stuff and this formula has done an amazing job of making it disappear. My carpet is light colored and she seems to barf up a dark brown color goo. I spray this on using the Bissell hand cleaner. I let it sit for a short time and then use the cleaner. Not only does it clean up the colored stuff (need to first pick up any ""chunks"") but it also eliminates any smell.  There is no stain residue. Good stuff.
"
Julie Bishop,5.0,2018 18 August,"
I bought this for my Bissell mini cleaner for the dining room chairs.  I ended up just dumping this stuff into a bucket with hot water and literally flooding the chairs as they were ""that"" dirty after being stored in a supposedly air conditioned unit (a MUST for here in FL).  Got the mold and mildew off, and some old very small stains that have just always been there.  I have used a LOT of steam cleaner products, this one ranks right at the top.  Nice fresh smell, not overpowering, but it literally gets all the stains out.
"
James P.,5.0,2021 19 March,"
Easy to use and mix. Fresh scent. Works well with the smaller machine. Not all the soap is made for the smaller unit so make sure your getting the right cleaner.
"
"""pxyktn""",5.0,2021 2 February,"

Petrarch,5.0,2019 2 October,"
I do like this cleaner. I bought it to use with the SpotBot I purchased and I love the way it cleans deep down stains. If I had a critique it would be that it is pricey for the amount of cleaner you get. That doesn't make me all that happy and would probably look elsewhere for a better price or use another product I like just as well.
"
Angela Bowens,5.0,2020 28 March,"
I have a new puppy and this has been a lifesaver! I’ve been using this cleaner in my bissell pet stain eraser, super powerful and easy to grab for a quick clean up that you need when you have a 9 week old puppy. Gets stains and smells out the first time.  Definitely worth the money.
"
Leigh A. Delany,3.0,2019 24 January,"
This is the perfect size for the hand held Bissell pet stain remover. Simply empty contents into compartment and you are ready to go. Unfortunately, that is all there is for your $11. A good bottle to use as a guide for how much cleaner to use. There is enough for 4 refills in this bottle. It is not concentrated. You use it as is. Considering how small an area you can clean with one fill, it is simply not worth the money. Sorry Bissell.  I did one cat accident with the Bissell cleaner, and another one (identical stains) with the Awesome pre-soak laundry liquid I got at Dollar Tree.  When they dried, I honestly could not see any difference. The cleaning machine, however, is very handy, especially when you can leave the cleaning liquid in it when not in use.

I use this product in the handheld Bissell pet carpet as instructed in the users manual.  I use a liberal amount and make sure I scrub it into my carpets and ensure the product and urine are completely extracted from the carpet.  Unfortunately the carpet and room still reek of urine after the use of this product.  Truth be told the only product I have ever purchased and use to this day that truly removes urine smell is Nature's Miracle Urine Destroyer.  I am not an employee or have any financial interests in the company, I am just communicating about the product I find the most effective.

This product will clean your carpet/couch that has no stains on it. I have not tried it on stains so I can’t tell you if it works on them or not. Not a huge fan of the scent but it doesn’t last. Product is not thick at all so not sure of the concentration. Expensive for what it is.

This produce was amazingly effective on my dog vomit & urine stains.  I cleaned the spots immediately so I don't know how it works on old stains, dry spots or stains that have ""set in"".  I use at full strength and it seems to work with any small spot cleaning device/machine.

Dustin Alexander,5.0,2020 18 November,"
He did a great job removing stains and the smell was great.
"
Gemma,1.0,2022 26 June,"
Before and after pics.Doesn't remove stains and smell completely.I tried to clean these chairs with only the Bissell Professional Spot and Stain and it didn't do much. So I made a mix of dawn soap and softener. Works amazing. Way better for cleaning and cheaper because it goes by quick.
"
Featherznfur,5.0,2020 28 September,"
Of all spot removers and shampoo for carpet it is by far the best
"
Audriauna,5.0,2021 3 March,"

Takes up stains.  Cleaned spot stains on carpets.  My car upholstery was heavily stained.  Cleaned it but couldn't make interior like new.  Perhaps with a few more rounds.

"
CW Pope,4.0,2019 25 March,"
The spot remover works pretty well, but for the money, it does not go very far.  It would be better to have a concentrate at a lower cost.

Shannon LaRoche,5.0,2018 25 August,"
What I was thinking when I bought off white bar stools, I have no idea...There was mystery marker? make up? some red stain on the chair for about 2 weeks until I got around to addressing it and realized I was out of upholstery cleaner. Purchased this and am super pleased, used with my bissel spot bot.
"
Adrian P. Gee,4.0,2018 29 May,"
Works well with the Bissell spot remover - which is also great for  cleaning. The trouble is that the machine drinks the stuff. I am going through bottles of this cleaner and may have to find something cheaper that works as well.
"
Rock_Lee,5.0,2018 4 December,"
Love the cleaning power of this product it does really good job cleaning deep into the cars carpets and seats to get the small to mild to even deep stains out. And I love the  smell of the product after i clean leaves very enjoyable  fresh smell.
"
Freda L. Kelly,5.0,2019 3 July,"
This was used for my cats that like to scarf and barf...and hairballs. All done on carpet. It cleans really well and the smell is nice. Would recommend this product. I got a hand held cleaning machine for this reason. Works beautifully
"
David Crossley ,5.0,2020 5 January,"

It smells so good. And definitely remove all stains out my carpet.
"
Barb,5.0,2018 30 July,"
This solution is amazing. I spilled beet soup on beige carpeting. I didn’t have any carpet cleaning solution and my spot lifter machine wasn’t working. I had to order a new machine and this solution from Amazon so the spot sat for three days. To my surprise, all the red stain came out!

"
Carolyn F,5.0,2019 26 March,"
Used this product in the Bissell Deluxe Spot Cleaner - this cleans well without leaving a funky residue or smell if used according to the instructions. My only complaint is with the device which uses a lot of the product at once.
"
Maria V. Mejia,4.0,2020 30 January,"
Excellent and effective product.
"
Eric,3.0,2020 15 August,"
Did not do great on coke stains and blood stain that were in our carpet. It is not concentrated so just pour the solution directly into your spot cleaner.
"
Emily Wurtz,4.0,2018 18 January,"
Works really well. I gave it 4 stars because if you do a whole staircase or large room you'll go through a whole bottle. It got out asphalt from my carpet that was tracked in.
"
Jes A,5.0,2018 14 June,"
I drive a car with fabric upholstery for Lyft. I used this in my Proheat cleaner and it removed a spot of adhesive that a professional upholstery shop couldn't get out. Overall, my seats and carpet looked almost new again after the first use.Customers complimented the smell for days.
"
Ocram,4.0,2019 30 September,"

"
Amanda,5.0,2019 14 July,"
This product for stains worked really well on a coffee stain on my car floorboard. The scents not too bad either, it was a nice fresh scent. And it really works to get those unwanted stains out.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 6 January,"
Removes tough stains.
"
B.m,5.0,2019 7 January,"
Definitely the best spot remover that I have found yet. I use it in a spray bottle and a little brush scrubs just about any stain out. I've not had any stains come back or show through again.

"
Bree Giron,3.0,2020 10 December,"
This product is easy to use but the tool to use it wasn’t that great!
"
Gerri Rowley,5.0,2019 15 November,"

"
BrtneCrt,5.0,2020 15 November,"
Would buy again.
"
j8819,5.0,2019 9 June,"
This worked well with my portable cleaner. Following the directions for deep stain will require much of the product; I recommend ordering more than one bottle. I used it on discolored upholstery and it removed the discoloration.
"
R. R. Blair,5.0,2018 12 August,"
I purchased the latest small hand-held Bissell spot cleaner to use in place of a full size upright Bissell cleaner. The Bissell Professional Spot and Stain + Oxy cleaner, used in my portable Bissell machine removes spots quickly and with far less effort than the older larger machine ever did.

"
lemlemmar,5.0,2020 17 January,"
If you spill or a dog has a terrible accident this will literally wipe the stain from existence. Highly recommend.
"
Robert Thurman,3.0,2020 3 May,"
Doesnt do what it claims. Maybe for very very lightly soiled carpet, like a hint of dirt. But it doesn't put a dent in any kind of pet stain.

I ordered the bissell cleaning solution twice through Amazon. The first bottle worked fine. The second, gave my hand a chemical burn like you would get from bleach. The solution in the second bottle was cloudy unlike the original clear solution. I’m very disappointed with my 2nd bottle and warn others to just order through target.

I'm not sure if this stuff that will be fairly expensive to keep up since it goes through the machine so fast is it even worth repurchasing. For all I know it could be plain water. And the machine leaks every time I try to empty the dirty water container.

Tom Steele,5.0,2018 16 January,"
I've used most of the Bissel cleaners at some point or another. This has been one of my favorites so far. I like the pet stain and odor remover too. But I really like the Oxy clean in this and it seems to get really stubbob stains out. We have both a Bissel and another brand of cleaner and this works well in both and there are easy directions to figure out the right amount to mix together no matter what brand you use.I have no idea if you really need to use Bissel solution or if other brands would work fine, but we get the Bissel because it always works well, so why try something else? This just works and the spot and stain formula seems to be concentrated to really get tough stains out.Here's my END-ALL TEST.  We have a small pomeranian with a weak stomach. He has to have Science Diet dog food or he throws up this neon yellow bile liquid that stains like crazy. And he's always getting into something bad somehow or another and we have episodes every month or so.If this can get that stain out, then we know it is good. I tested it by finding one of those spots and cleaning it then asking my wife to come in and see if she could find where the stain had been. I had marked the location in my mind using a couple of landmarks in the room. She couldn't find where it had been and it was hard for me, even though I knew where it was. This stuff is good!
"
Kayce McCarty,4.0,2018 9 January,"
We are always looking for a product to help clean our carpets. We have three older dogs who have accidents, so we frequently need to do some spot cleaning with our small carpet cleaner.Bissell is a brand we trust and have used for many years. This cleaner works well - better than others we have tried. It also helps keep areas cleaner longer. Seems to repel dirt sticking to areas where stains were.The scent is pleasant - not overwhelming like other products we have used.If you have pets and carpets, I highly recommend this product.
"
Squeal,4.0,2018 8 June,"
We use this in our Pet Stain Eraser and it works well to get out our pet and kid stains.  I just wish we didn’t have to use so much of the bottle each time. (Sometimes I cheat and don’t put in as much solution as is called for because I can’t stand using up the bottle so fast. Shhh.)  I always keep at least one bottle on hand for the next pet accident or markers/paint on carpet snafu.
"
Ini P,5.0,2018 12 August,"
This is a great stain remover. I used it with my Bissell Spotclean ProHeat Pet machine. This was my first time using this spot and stain solution and it worked like a charm. My 3 year old opened a pack of paint (from the dollar store) when I wasn't looking and of course spilled it all over herself and the carpet. I wanted to cry but I was still hopeful it would come out with this solution. Good thing I had it already. Some spots were a little harder to clean up but I sprayed some of it on the stain and let it sit for a minute or two and it came up. As you can see in the pictures, it's like it never happened. I will say that I added some bissell oxy boost formula that came with my spot cleaner. I don't know how well this works on older set in stains. But it works like a charm with fresh ones.
"
Cody Robertson,4.0,2018 10 June,"
If youre using this solution, do yourself a favor and wear gloves. Its says OXY on it for a reason. Hydrogen peroxide is the oxidizing agent and the concentration is alot more than what youre used to. Its been 2 days and my hands still feel the effects. Great product, works well, but just do yourself a favor and wear gloves
"
D.Berdanis,5.0,2018 2 January,"
I love Bissell cleaning products to use in my Bissell carpet cleaner.  I can't recall ever having anything but good to say about their products.I just cleaned the carpet in my whole house, after the holidays were over.  What I love is how well the pet stains come out.As easy to use as any other carpet cleaning product I've used.  Just add the amount needed into the soap dispenser and clean carpet as usual.Because I'm always right on anything that dirties my carpet, I don't have any real tough stains.  I did have 2 spots that didn't dry quickly and the damp area got dirty again and left a dirtier spot.  Going over those areas a couple of times with the machine and the spots were gone.I also noticed that there wasn't any strong soap odor when I used this.Never had any problem with Bissell carpet cleaning products and will always specifically buy them whenever I clean my carpets.
"
Joanna D.,5.0,2017 24 December,"
This cleaner is FAR MORE EFFECTIVE than others I've used. The oxy bleach takes out stains well. If you've used the brand you get in the grocery store (red jug), I can tell you, the Bissell is way better. Sadly, the local stores never carry it, so if you have a potential carpet emergency, you may want to keep this on hand.I've tried several brands of pet-cleanup products and Bissell comes out on top every single time.
"
Melanie S.,5.0,2020 21 June,"
I've had a Bissell spot bot for a while. I mostly used it when we had a dog but kept it around for furniture and car upholstery. But I generally just used a mix of whatever laundry of fabric cleaner we had with water or OxiClean. But after getting a couple of stains on the couch I finally bought this and I was very impressed by the results. It got both of the spots I cleaned with zero issues and one had been there for months. So for that reason alone, it's been 100% worth it. I do wish it was concentrated and you got more out of a bottle but unless you're a pet owner hopefully you're not using it frequently.
"
M. J. Mccaffrey,5.0,2018 16 January,"
We have an active little Sheltie who sometimes has an active little bladder. 'nuff said about that.We own a 
Bissell Pet Stain Eraser Cordless Portable Carpet Cleaner
 that uses spot cleaning fluid to soak and vacuum up messes. This type of cleaning machine does a bit of scrubbing on its own, but is mostly an application and removal vehicle for the fluid that does the work.The Professional Spot and Stain + Oxi fluid does that work very well. With the ""professional"" label, I was expecting a strong industrial aroma when I opened the bottle, but in fact it has a mild scent that reminds me a little of the green-apple scent that accompanies the dedicated ""pet stain eraser"" chemical.As for how it works: very well. It put down a proper misty stream, and after five minutes brought up the urine components that cause stained carpets. I did not need to use very much for the test stain, which means the machine still has a load ready for the next cleaning job.
"
C. Hamilton,5.0,2018 29 March,"
We have a Bissell pet carpet cleaner. We currently have one young dog who is still being potty trained and one cat who is older and vomits occasionally. We use our carpet cleaner quite often. You do not have to dilute this spot cleaner. You can just pour it into the carpet cleaner and you are good to go.We used it on an older mystery stain, an area the dog peed in the day before (that had been cleaned as well as possible with hand towels and spray) and a new cat puke stain (after removing what could be removed). It removed all of the stains. Some of the stains (particularly older ones) require the machine to be left on it a few minutes or moved back and forth several times. The areas smelled clean and fresh afterwards. It seemed to remove all of the unwanted scents. I would definitely recommend this solution.
"
Terry R. Nye,5.0,2017 28 December,"
A small bottle of this Bissell Professional Spot and Stain + Oxy cleaning solution was provided with a Bissell Pet Stain eraser wet vacuum I ordered.  I was thrilled to see it available in this 32 ounce size.  We have 5 cats one of whom vomits frequently, so having a good rug and carpet cleaning solution is crucial.  What really sets this product apart from others we have used is it not only cleans up recent stains and pet messes well but even removed some old carpet stains that had been present for a very long time.  Minimal scrubbing is needed, and this solution makes the portable Bissell wet vacuums work great.This is a great cleaning solution for portable wet vacuums, and is ideal for pet owners.  Definitely highly recommended.
"
Brad,4.0,2018 23 July,"
Works very well at removing new and old stains. Having said that a lot only goes a little ways. It is only for spot cleaning though so that should be expected. Good product.
"
NicbachDVM,5.0,2018 9 January,"
For some reason, this particular solution is only compatible with the Bissell handheld machines. I'm not sure what the difference is that would cause this not to be used in full sized machines, but be aware of this. They have the model numbers listed. I used this in the Little Green Machine.A stomach virus ravaged my household this weekend, and I had a 5 year old vomiting up blackberries all over our white carpet. After doing a prep scrub and seeing the berries rub into the fibers, I was convinced this would never come clean.I used the full strength (full cup) and went to town. Numerous passes and wouldn't you know - it came 90% out. That's way better than I ever imagined it would. I'll have to finish with my full sized machine, but it exceeded my expectations. And it smells nice. Recommended.
"
⛵⚓Seas the Day⚓⛵,5.0,2018 8 April,"
I love my Bissell machine, I’ve had a couple through the years but I don’t ever want to be without my Bissell. The Bissell Professional Spot and Stain + Oxy Portable Machine Formula in the  32 Oz is a great cleaner for an affordable price. At our local store, you will pay much more than here on Amazon for a good carpet cleaner formula. The spot and stain formula is a strong formula and cleans extremely well.
"
Janis,5.0,2019 2 November,"
I have the Bissell small portable cleaner for pet stains.  I just read some of the other reviews, I guess I didn't read the instructions and I have been diluting it just like I was diluting the solutions for the uprights when I used them in the portable.  This one still works better diluted than all the other Bissell carpet cleaners I have tried, and I've tried many.  For a stain that just won't come out, use Stain 1.  (I pried that recommendation from my professional carpet cleaner, he was torn up about letting it slip).
"
OutlawPoet,5.0,2018 31 January,"
This works very well.My grown dog sometimes gets puppy headed and I have mistakes to clean up.  It easily lifts the stains and the carpet looks clean and fresh!I should add that it also cleans up the hot chocolate stain your nine-year-old makes and doesn't tell you about and tries to clean but fails and hides it under a dog bed thinking you'll never see it.  (This was a...moment.)Easily adds to my carpet cleaner and works very quickly.  No irritating aroma.
"
BookWorm,5.0,2018 7 February,"
I have a 17 year old cat wit.h kidney disease, which means she often upchucks on the carpet, so I need a very heavy duty carpet cleaning shampoo. This Bissell Spot and Stain product works well to remove those horrible stains made by pet foods. Using the hottest water I can get out of my faucet, I clean up the stain by hand, then use my spot-cleaning machine with this shampoo to clean up the area. The results are perfect! Even stains that have been on the carpet overnight come clean using this product.Even if you don't wish to drag out your carpet cleaning machine, using this shampoo and a washcloth produces good results until you can get after it with your machine.Five stars for cleaning up kitty upchuck stains.

So i ordered this even tho my pups have not had a accident in a long time. Then a day after i got it...my dog had diarrhea all over our carpet!! To be fair she just had puppies and so her tummy is all messed up, but dang that was a mess!!After the inital cleaning, the next morning there was still a brown spot on the floor, so i got out my handy little green machine and used this and it cleaned it right up!!Not the best smelling cleaner ever but it worms and that is what counts.
"
Betty,5.0,2018 3 January,"
We do share our home with pets, and the family room Berber carpet gets a workout. This is an excellent stain lifting product to use with our Bissell machine. We were careful to use the recommended amount and added no boosters. The results were outstanding, with a fresher smelling atmosphere, too. Drying was as expected, and no shadows appeared. It is so concentrated that the value is okay, too.
"
KODY,5.0,2018 7 January,"
I own the Bissell portable Pet and Spot cleaners (yes I own a dog!) and this cleaner works great in both.  I have found using an Oxy based cleaner to clean up urine accidents works much better at getting rid of both the stain and the odor of the accident.  It is great using this with either of the machines inbetween doing an overall cleaning of the carpet which I do about twice a year.  Effective product!

"
Joseph91,5.0,2018 26 January,"
This is a great product. Bissell recommends this for their spot cleaning line, not their deep cleaners, so they may think that Oxy is too much cleaning power for a whole carpet, but I would be comfortable using it either in our Spot Shot or our Green Machine, as long as we limit the use to the stained area. Either way, it's death on stains! Recommended.
"
TobycW,5.0,2018 9 January,"
Although you can use any carpet cleaner in the SpotClean Pro, I opted to try this Bissell branded product.  It works well and doesn't affect any of the carpet I have tried it on.  I use our SpotClean mainly on pet stains.  Gets stains out without much fuss.

This Bissell Professional Spot and Stain + Oxy does a great job  My15 yr old  Grandson tends not to be as careful or picky as I am  and  does not clean up spills as thoroughly as I do .Easy to use, reasonable price and I have always  trusted  Bissell products.
"
ER,5.0,2018 20 February,"

I have dogs and cats and live in mud country. This stuff works like a dream, the carpets get really nice and squeaky clean. I run my carpet cleaner at least twice a month, plus spot issues. I use it my hoover machine and it works fine.
"
Schwartz,5.0,2018 7 January,"
This cleaned up spots on my carpet from our dog's dirty feet without issue. However, to be fair any Bissell cleaning solution I have tried has seemed to work equally well but I didn't have any complaints with this one. Overall I'd say if you see it and need it and the price is right get some.

Tom Bricknell,1.0,2021 22 May,"
I bought this assuming that it was a concentrate, since it said to check instructions on your cleaner for how much to use.  Instructions on cleaner does not really say implying that you use it full strength but you really do not know for sure.  This is deceptive packaging to get people to buy VERY expensive per use liquid.  I am very disappointed in this companies very obvious intentional deception to trick you while you are in a store and can't evaluate its value without the machine instructions.  This is inexcusable I  will likely not buy any of this companies products again.

Matt,5.0,2018 3 January,"
This works great in the Bissell Spotclean machine.  A little goes a long way, so this bottle lasts a long time.  It has a fresh smell to it and gets out pretty much every stain you can imagine.  We did have to run it twice over a stubborn stain, but it still worked after that second time.  Overall, great!
"
Sean Ries,4.0,2021 30 August,"
It is exactly the original, meant for your machine.  Shipped quick which is great because we really needed to clean the carpet before company came!  Honestly my biggest problem with this item is the packaging.  I understand wanting to create a signature look, but having the bottle be wider at the base than it needs to be just means it takes up valuable space in the cupboard.  For those of us that have limited space, it is a pain to have items like this taking up the space.
"
Denny,5.0,2020 24 July,"
I cannot emphasize how amazing this product is. I shattered a full glass of red wine all over new WHITE carpet, and this was able to get it out instantly. On top of that, any of the messes our dog has made have come out so easily and so clean. I live by this product now and don't buy any other carpet cleaners. Even if not using for a dog, it's amazing. I recommend it to everyone I meet.Carpet cleaner that actually cleans, and it smells great too.

 I bought this for my bissell spot stain vacuum,  I loved how the 8 oz it came with did the job so I decided to get the bigger one instead,it really does take out the stains and it was very very surprising how it actually worked, it makes the carpet smell good as well , it isn’t a super super strong scent but you can definitely smell it, so if you have any pets I recommend this aswell because animals can make some things stink lol.
"

It took a few minutes to figure out how the device worked, but I have a lot of satisfaction from using the  Bissell Professional Spot Remover with the supplied cleaning solvent...easy to use, easy to clean, and works better than expected on my carpeting...
"
chat,3.0,2020 8 September,"
I bought a Bissel machine with this formula. I was able to remove a light stained of my couch but I cant seem to do a spot stained. I did it over and over and once dry I tried it again but it is still there. I wonder if I should mix a little bleach in it to help.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 11 July,"
I like the smell and the ease of use. I have tile floors in my apartment so I use lots of area rugs, large and small. The small ones can go in the washer, but for the large ones, I use a carpet shampooer and vacuum. It's a Bissel, so this is the product I use to clean my large rugs.
"
Chris,5.0,2020 30 December,"
My dog gets into all kinds of stuff and it comes out both ends. Bissell Spot and Stain works great in my spot cleaner, as well if not better than any other pet specific cleaner and it’s very good on paint spills and mud. Scent is fresh and not overpowering.

I used this product for spor stains on my carpet in house and for cleaning my car.  What I don't care for is the scent is really short lived and small.  I'd like that it had a stronger scent.  Cleans well and honestly I brush scrub the stain and my vehicle carpet before I shampoo.

This is amazing.  It has removed every fresh stain on our off-white carpet, including cat vomit and BLACK shoe polish liquid.  Literally no trace of anything while using this stuff.  Follow the directions exactly and you will be satisfied.  I highly recommend this and the Bissell portable carpet cleaner (handheld) for getting up new stains.  Keep it handy and full of the cleaning fluid so that you can get right on pet stains when they happen (or just get rid of your pet - ha!).

I bought these as a low cost option to the cheapo glasses at Walmart. I was not disappointed at all. They have a nice thin rim and they are great. They are something that you need to be gentle with. But for those saying they broke easily, if you look in the pictures, they show a broken glass replacement policy. I broke 2 and simply messaged the seller through Amazon like it says and within a day I have 2 new glasses on the way. I recommend snapping a picture of the broken glass to make things easier. But I found out after the fact and they worked with me and stood behind their promise!

Great price for a great wine glass! It’s wide on the sides, it looks expensive! I received a lot of compliments from my friends and received a-lot of questions on where I got it from. Unfortunately 2 of my glasses had broken previously after a month of use but the owners customer service levels are exceptional! They did not hesitate to apologize for the inconvenience and provide me another pair of glasses which I was very grateful for because I truly loved the glass and it’s unique shape!! Thank you so happy to have my pair of 4 again!!
"
Craig W.,5.0,2022 14 May,"
These glasses add just the right amount of luxury to a good meal.  They are not the thinnest you'll find but they are nothing like a thick glass.  That being said, they still feel delicate and will feel like being cared for.  the rim feels nice for my almost weekly meal of crab legs with a chardonnay.  I like that they feel somewhat right for either white or red.  I enjoy a nice Paso Robles Cab with a ribeye from time to time and it feels nice for that as well.  I am still on a hunt for a thinner red.  I have a thinner white that I got from a Rombauer gift set.  But these are just the right price for enough to go around the table and also for weekly use.  I like them.  just had crab legs tonight...here is a pic of my chardonnay...sorry for the dirty smudges.

I loved the shape of these glasses and the thinness. Disappointed, after only 5-6 uses one of them broke. Always washed them by hand. They were in the dishpan soaking and I reached in to wash one and it was broken. Don’t even know how it broke. Wouldn’t buy again, too fragile.

Update:After I posted the review below, the seller contacted me asking what they could do to make the situation better.  They offered to replace the products.  I accepted.  (I had forgotten about the warranty as I'm not used to glassware having warranties). I received the glasses 2 days later.  (The Amazon rep says that often sellers will reach out but then never send the promised replacements!)  This is a reputable seller and I will buy from them in the future if needed.  Again, this is customer service as it should be.Original post:This is a very pretty goblet.  Holds a lot which is what I wanted as was using it for summer lemonade spritzers.  However on the second hand washing/drying a large chunk of the glass fell out!Became gun shy for other such looking glasses.Mention:  when went to return I read that I would have to send back and then wait for refund.  Hmm.  So I called Amazon Customer Service.  I was credited for the glasses and didn't have to return unbroken glass.  That's what customer service is supposed to be.

Rodney Gooding,3.0,2022 22 February,"
This is not a carefree wine glass - if your drunk perhaps don't use these.. at all.Using this glass is a deliberate action, to be enjoyed but cautiously as even pouring into it with your bottle leads to cracks if you ding it 😱We bought 4 and argue about whose turn it is to clean it and put them away everytime we use it - we're down to 1 now so...  I can't recommend it as we're paranoid about them - every time we go to wash it it's a joy as the neck is too narrow so you can't put your hand into it so enjoy cleaning it... Somehow.however you do that is up to you but might I suggest NOT shoving a scrub cloth into it, using a spoon to reach into it to help clean it or the dishwasher.Handwash carefully as it will split with pressure!For your sanity buy 3x what you think you need and use carefully or just avoid it altogether - it's a beautiful wreck just waiting to happen.Durability is a joke, but a joy to behold 😓

"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 30 September,"
when my boyfriend and I learned we would be quarantining for the unforeseeable future we realized we were going to be drinking a lot of wine.  wanting a glass that would be versatile to many types of wine and also have a light crisp high end feel. I really wanted NICE glasses. I ordered these and was pleasantly surprised at how perfect they were.  I promptly washed them and poured us our first drink, we said cheers and gently tapped our glasses AND ONE SMASHED... hadn't even had contact with our lips yet and we were cleaning up spilled celebration. I promptly ordered another pair, because they really are that great, and we assumed it was our fault. BUT just to be sure I shot an email to the company asking if there was a way to replace one and ya know what they did.... sent us a new set. immediately, without question and expedited ....  they even checked back to make sure we were happy and noted that during these unprecedented times they want to take care of people... or something to that effect which made me cry.moral of the story- buy these glasses. for yourself, as a gift, as gift for yourself.  they are beautiful and feel lovely in your hand, and we haven't had another break since! I even put them in the dishwasher because I like to like dangerously and they come out perfect every time.

The glasses arrived on time. They were very well packed. Unfortunately, one of them broke the second week after I received them, while I was washing them. You have to be VERY mindful of how delicate they are.

Best wine glass I've owned thus far. Yes, they are thin and a bit fragile, but that's what I want. A lightweight, thin rimmed glass. You just have to treat them with extra care. The shape of these glasses really accentuates  the aromas of the wine. I primarily  got these for bold reds, but I've found that whites are just at home in these as well.
"
Lynn Weymann,5.0,2022 12 May,"
I really like these glasses. They look pretty, they have a nice balance, and they are lightweight while holding a good sized glass of wine. I haven't had them long so I can't gauge durability. I have just been lightly washing by hand after use. I got 2 but I will be adding a couple more.

Nice size & shapeHowever not very sturdy. Thin glass, would break easy
"
Corrina Kingbird,5.0,2022 17 May,"
We have had this product for a bit of time now and one of the glasses had gotten chipped. When we asked about the lifetime warranty we were met with the absolute best customer service and expedited shipping for a replacement.  10/10 will buy glasses from them again.
"
Raymond K.,5.0,2022 26 March,"
I found these glass and knew I must have them. I really like the product and how they look. When they arrived, one of the glass stems was broke even though the glasses were properly packaged, but something happened during delivery and the glass broke. I contacted the company and they dropped-shipped a replacement. I cannot say more about the customer service. They were on it right away. Well done! I’ve already shared my experience with friends because I believe in this company.
"
Brooke Pennington,5.0,2022 30 March,"
Gave these as a gift and they were very well received. Was lucky to be able to sample some wine from them afterward and they really do make a difference in taste. The shape is perfect for getting a sense of the wine's fragrance, and the delicate glass makes them seem a lot more expensive than they are. Will definitely be giving these as gifts again in the future for their popularity and low price point.
"
Lissan,5.0,2022 30 May,"
These are beautiful wine glasses. One glass cracked while I was hand drying and the seller immediately sent a replacement. They were very attentive and provided quick service. I will definitely order again from this company.
"
HB,5.0,2022 5 March,"
Update (3/11/22): After my review the seller contacted me and asked to replace the broken glass. They did NOT ask me to change my review or for anything in return. The order arrived today! Top notch customer service! Highly recommend these products with customer service clearly being their top priority!These are very pretty but one broke within a month. I was too slow to request a return. Oh well. If you can be very careful with them, they are really nice, but very fragile.
"
David Whaley,5.0,2022 18 May,"
I love the new glasses. The large bowl makes it super easy to aerate, it's easy to hold, and its a conversation starter. I will definetely buy again when I'm in need of more glasses.
"
Ivan,5.0,2022 30 May,"
I bought these wine glasses and they are quite nice.  Really like the customer service of the company as well.  I recommend these wine glasses.

"
Whitniferus,5.0,2022 26 April,"
I love these wine glasses. They are a perfect gift or an addition to your home. I have clumsy hands and have dropped these glasses at an exceptional height and they are still good to go. I appreciate these glasses.
"
Nathan,5.0,2022 4 July,"
Good packaging. Good quality
"
Laura Sherwood,5.0,2022 18 June,"
Beautiful shape!!  Very classy, they hold a nice amount of wine.
"
Richard Chen,2.0,2022 31 July,"
I dropped in a few ice cubes (literally from the opening of the glass, so only a few inches) and upon landing into the glass, the ""glass"" cracked and a piece fell off. so now it is basically useless. The glass was kept in room temperature and the ice cube is your regular ice cube, not extra sharp or heavy or anything. This was also only my 3rd time using them, so it definitely wasn't from regular wear and tear either. So yea, unless you plan on being 100x extra careful with these glasses, these are not sturdy at all and you should probably just spend extra money on higher quality glass.
"
Kindle Customer,4.0,2021 14 May,"
We are avid wine drinkers and really like these.  They are very elegant, and not too expensive.  Somewhere in the middle regarding quality, but GREAT as a standard glass.  We tend to like bigger glasses and these have a beautiful shape and are a pleasure to drink from.  One thing to note, they are hand blown, so there can be variations.  We ordered 2, liked them a lot so bought 6 more.  2 of the 6 were noticeably thicker stems vs. the rest and when I wrote the company asking about this, they sent replacements without question.  Definitely would recommend for the casual wine drinker!
"
Diana,5.0,2022 8 March,"
I was surprised by the quality of the wine glasses.They are simply beautifully crafted. The feel of the stem in your hand is light weight to the touch. The diameter of the opening of the glass is perfect to allow the aroma of the wine  to breathe.So happy I went on an brought two more .
"
Abe,4.0,2019 31 December,"
I ordered two of these for twenty bucks. Wow, great deal. Nice quality. I'm six feet tall and have medium-sized hands so you can get an idea of the proportionate size of said glass. It's not that large. In fact, I was hoping for a bit bigger, but I'm okay with these. They are handblown so people who want machine-perfect glasses need to stay calm and smell the wine. Hand blown glass = charming. Yeah, there might be a little imperfection here or there (I haven't found any yet) but it is made by skilled artisans and not a bunch of morons in a huge factory with machines doing everything. These glasses have nice karma as a result. I'm going to enjoy drinking some good wine in them. I tend to buy bottles in the $20-$30 price range and I use Vivino to find tasty wines with high ratings, so I'm no slouch and these glasses will do just fine. I might order a few more.
"
BLU,4.0,2021 21 November,"
Glasses are beautiful but very delicate. We had an issue with one glass and the seller resolved the issue immediately and was very responsive to our messages. We enjoy using the glasses while entertaining.

LUCY S.,5.0,2022 30 April,"
The glass literally cracked after a clicked my friends glass during a toast. However, the seller was quick to respond and corrected the problem.
"
kimtran,5.0,2019 25 May,"
I ordered both the Burgundy style and the all purpose style. I love how delicate and clear the glasses are. Definitely what I was looking for from a classy step up from Target kind of wine glass! I love looking at the color of my red wine when drinking from the Burgundy glass. The all purpose for my whites is perfect as well. Had a massive wine haul from a recent Napa trip and I knew I had to upgrade my glasses. These are it. However, shipping and packaging is a critical problem. Because of how delicately these are made, they are so easily breakable. And they certainly did break. Customer service is top notch in replacing the glasses, however it took three shipments to finally get all the glasses I ordered intact! I hate to waste all this packaging and glass because they are poorly packaged to begin with. That's my only reason for one star off.Update: Adding a star back. I use these glasses weekly and always wash carefully by hand. Have had these for two years. Still beautiful and holding up nicely. I'm seeing lots of angry reviews of people breaking their glasses during use. These are in fact very delicate glasses. You have to treat accordingly!
"
Lisa,5.0,2022 16 January,"
I have had 2 of them since November and use the same one every night.  I love the feel, tallnees of the stem & how it swirls the wine.  I usually hand wash it but have put it in the dish washer too.  Just handle with care.  They are delicate, but that is why they look so beautiful!  Great packaging too.
"
Tam Ralston,5.0,2021 28 July,"
I ordered these beautiful glasses and I absolutely love them. While I was washing one of my glasses, it broke. I knew that the company stood behind their product. I got out my box that they were sent in and looked for the email address to reach out to them. As soon as I emailed them, I had a response within the hour. From the time I reached out to this company to the time the new ones were on my door step was less than two days. I AM OVER THE MOON IMPRESSED WITH ATTENTION TO CUSTOMER SERVICE.Not only is it the best product, but the company stands behind their product. I would HIGHLY recommend this product for sure.

PWade,5.0,2022 29 May,"
Beautiful glasses  Excellent quality
"
Scott's Mom,5.0,2021 7 February,"
I absolutely love these glasses!  They're so elegant.  Shipping was super fast and they're packed so safely I could probably have thrown the box across the room and done no damage.  The only reason I marked sturdiness and durability with 4's is because these are hand blown, super thin glasses (which is what I wanted).  A person will have to be careful with them because of that, making them not all that sturdy and durable, so if you want a wine glass that you can bang around, drop, or take with you on a picnic, I guess these are not them.  I, on the other hand, got exactly what I was looking for with this purchase.  Love Love Love them!  Highly recommend for the discerning wine drinker.
"
Wendy E. Gibson,5.0,2022 9 April,"
I love the look of these glasses, they’re very pretty and elegant, pretty tall - it’s a pretty large wine glass, which I love
"
MTM,5.0,2022 28 February,"
Great glasses.  Very light to hold. They are fragile so have to be careful washing and storing etc. but very good. I wanted a thin rim and that is what these have.  Extremely good packaging and arrived quickly.
"
Deb,5.0,2021 2 February,"
I have had my set of glasses for over 2 months.  I use them constantly!  I have no idea why some are claiming they are 'so fragile'.  And for those stating they were broke as soon as they opened them....  I can almost guarantee it was due to the 'delivery person'.  I have personally witnessed many of them just tossing packages and have had a couple other items shattered because of that.  I have accidentally knocked mine off of the coffee table and nothing happened.  I was very reluctant to put them in the dishwasher because of the reviews.  But I finally decided to and they were 100% fine!!  They are classy and fun!!  LOVE THESE!!  And HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!!
"
Taja Simone,2.0,2022 2 August,"
I love the look of these glasses, but that are extremely fragile. This is my second time purchasing these and they have broken very easily. Something as simple as washing the rim with a wet paper towel, has caused them to crack and break. I thought maybe the first round was just a bad bath, but I was wrong. Very dissatisfied!
"
It's alright momma,5.0,2022 11 April,"
Love these glasses ! I love the look, feel, everything! Perfect for your bar or China cabinet.
"
Lisa Malone,5.0,2021 10 December,"
I didn’t save a pic.  I thought they were amazing, but the first day we washed them and hung them in the wine cabinet, it fell out and broke at the base. It did not shatter. It broke right at the base feom the stem. So we are going with user error and will be ordering them again
"
Drew,5.0,2022 1 March,"
Has a great shape style. I find it elegant. Very fragile n ultra thin. It does come across like it’s Plastic, but it’s not. Holds a great amount of wine. It’s  a plus 😉.
"
Aliye & Matt,2.0,2022 16 October,"
They are shaped nice but so thin! Not heavy and durable feeling like I wanted.
"
Omar,5.0,2021 12 December,"
Great look and feel, fancy, like my wife likes to say. I used them this past Thanksgiving and after the day was done I they broke while I dried them.  Not because I dropped them or anything like that, they literally broke as I was drying them with the drying towel.
"
Shandrika Andry,5.0,2022 17 April,"
I love the glasses but they are kinda thin.
"
SuperLoop,5.0,2021 7 February,"
Great product and excellent customer service.  We’ve ordered two sets of these.  Of those, one glass did come with some imperfections (nothing major).  Emailed them and they made it right with a new set immediately. Very nice and very fast.  Also, as to the durability, we did have one get knocked over and it did not break. I wouldn’t try it on purpose, but we escaped at least once. Due to the shape of the glass, there was also less of a spill. These are better than our previous wine glasses which were very nice.  The price is not too much at all considering the product and service if needed.
"
ANP,4.0,2021 18 August,"
Love the shape and size of these glasses. They feel so elegant. One did break as I was washing it but the company was great about replacing quickly, free of charge.
"
Emilia Tamburri,4.0,2021 14 July,"
These are attractive wine glasses. However, they need to be washed gently and handled with care. The glass is thin and breakable. If I’d known that in advance to avoid breaking the glass, I would give five stars for their look.
"
Daniel Lord,4.0,2020 23 July,"




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I like it how the weight of wine glass is very lite and it fells like you are not holding anything in your hand.I’m not an expert on wine glass but I was a little bit confused when it says Italian style and thinking that will be made in Italy but after I received the order the box sats it was made in China.So I’m not sure if this is considered a true Italian style wine glass or not.  Or is it just another mock knock of version of Italian style wine glass.

"
TnT71,5.0,2021 7 December,"
They are delicate and beautiful. Arrived without any damage. Not a glass that can be thrown around or handled outdoors. Stems are very delicate. The bowls are thin. This is what makes the wine taste so good. I would buy again....handle with care.

"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2021 13 April,"
I love the style and one broke from my original order ( the ice cube was too large) so I reordered the same product. Strangely, theGlass is more sturdy and the bell is larger than the first set.  Perhaps this is because they are uniquely hand made but the qualityIs very different: I prefer the more delicate first set.
"
Jung Hoon Kwon,1.0,2022 27 October,"
The tamper evident sticker was obviously torn before becuase it was loosely hanging off the box.  When I opened the box ot was obvious someone had already handled these glasses before.  Mot only are they very foggy and dirty, hut they were very slippery and quite disgusting to handle...  It seems used glasses have been sent to me, if not, then there's some serious issues at the factory.  Otherwose, it looks nice but probably very fragile.  Returning without hesitation.
"
Jayd Rowles,3.0,2022 29 March,"

"
Quay ❤️,4.0,2021 27 March,"
They are ok. You definitely get what you pay for. I was kind of hoping for a taller glass but it really doesn’t bother me. I’m just afraid they will break soon. I’m super careful with them. Other than how they feel, they look SUPER cute and classy ❤️❤️🍷I would gift them to someone who is new to wine ☺️
"
ATL_JLC,4.0,2021 2 May,"
I'm a buyer in the packaging industry. Glasses were packaged well and arrived unscathed. Definitely not an inexpensive way to ship. Glasses are beautiful. But I'm worried about how thin they are. They feel like they're going to snap in your hand when washing.  Handle them with kid gloves.
"
Francis,4.0,2021 30 July,"

Jayessare,5.0,2020 1 July,"
Update: I ordered another set of glasses for a wine tasting party. One glass arrived broken. I contacted the seller and in less than a week 2 additional wine glasses arrived at my doorstep in perfect condition. I can’t say enough good things about this seller. I hope to do business with the seller again in the future.I was looking for delicate rather than thick heavy wine glasses. These were just what I wanted. Your guests will think you paid a lot for these as they look elegant and expensive despite the low price. The packaging was very good and they arrived on time and in perfect condition. I just ordered another set.
"
Shannon Marie,5.0,2021 1 May,"
Finally hung my wine rack and wanted some really beautiful red wine glasses to fill all 8 spots. I could not be more happy with these! They are absolutely beautiful, I receive so many compliments on them. They are sturdy and but thin enough to feel fancy. I made it 4 months without someone breaking one. I emailed JBHO and they sent me a replacement set that arrived THE NEXT DAY! Amazing customer service. Purchase these glasses, you will not regret it!
"
Rice5,5.0,2021 8 July,"
These wine glasses are beautiful but delicate & can break if not handled with care which is what I discovered when I hand washed & one broke when I was drying. I contacted JBHO thrush email included pics & within 2 days to my surprise they replaced not just 1 broken glass but sent me 2. How’s that for exceptional customer service! You don’t see that too often nowadays.  Will definitely reorder.
"
Rachel,5.0,2021 2 December,"
It was very hard finding the right wine glass, but this one is perfect! Thin as I was looking for. Also, the customer service provided by JBHO is unmatched
"
Dayna Thompson,5.0,2020 20 May,"
I've been on the hunt for the perfect red wine glass and I finally found it with this brand. The glass is so sturdy, one solid piece (which adds to the sturdiness), and the shape is BEAUTIFUL. I loved them so much that I ordered a second set to have.  The glasses also arrived packaged very securely. The final thing that made me give this company and these glasses five stars was the customer service. They honor the part about replacing a broken glass at no cost to you. I clumsily dropped one  and they sent me a replacement no questions asked. From now on, all my drink ware will come from this company.

diane dancer,5.0,2020 14 August,"
What a great company with amazing customer service! First off The wine glasses are beautiful and I love the shape. It is really true that this company will replace a broken or defective glass. Two weeks after having these glasses I was washing one and the stem broke in half. I emailed the contact person and they were super responsive and mailed me a replacement glass right away. I got the replacement glass within five days! I think this is a really great company with really beautiful wine glasses that stand up to their promise of great customer service.

"
mer,5.0,2020 3 November,"
This company is amazing. I live in a remote part of Alaska, USA. Mail is infrequent due to weather and distance. Two beautiful wine glasses arrived and one stem had cracked. The packaging was excellent, but I blame it on the long journey here. I emailed the company and they immediately sent me replacements. Not just one glass, but two. I was SO impressed with the customer service and turn around on email response AND shipping. Thank you and I will order from your company in the future!!

Kali fi Aziza,5.0,2021 8 February,"
These glasses are so beautiful I've been showing them off nonstop in the 2 hrs since theyve arrived..I've put my Bestie on restriction..she likes to break stuff..dont tell her I told u.  They are truly amazing...idk about sturdy or durable they're glass. But they are definitely well made... going to be a repeat buyer of this brand..I hope they have some colored glasses as well...Jesus be a new wine glass cabinet...cause im going to need one.

Igor Antonio Nunes Pereira,5.0,2021 6 November,"
The glasses are amazing! I contacted the vendor about a concern I had and they promptly replied and helped me with my problem! I highly recommend this vendor!
"
Jalisa Beverly,1.0,2022 22 October,"
This is not bang for your buck. The 1st cup broke upon opening the package. Literally one touch and it shatters. The 2nd one broke while washing it gently because I knew how fragile it was. Don’t waste your money. Invest in decent glass. This can’t even be used as a one time ordeal because one bad touch and it’s broken into a bunch of pieces.
"
Pteryl Dactyl,5.0,2021 17 April,"
These delicate wine glasses are absolutely ideal for a perfect addition to one's table on all occasions  and/or celebrations with of course, a great wine. They are remarkably light and beautifully crafted so they must be handled with care. I recommend hand washing with soap & hot water, then drip drying in a rack as opposed to the typical ease of a dishwasher. Just sayin'. :-)
"
Sue T,5.0,2021 18 January,"
I wanted some stylish wine glasses with a big bowl and these are perfect! we also have some more expensive Riedel wine glasses but I much prefer the style  of these JBHO glasses.They are so well packaged. I have had these for almost 2 weeks now and they have had a lot of use use. Sturdy and go through the dishwasher easily and no problems. Highly recommend these glasses for any red wine lovers!
"
Leslie Sullivan,4.0,2020 2 October,"
The two wine glasses arrived fine with no damage. Love the shape for red wine. The glass itself is much lower quality than expected for the price. They are fragile, as was expected, however, they feel almost plastic having very little glass weight. Overall happy with the shape but disappointed in the quality.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 18 May,"
I had an issue with this product which I must had used a lot of force to wash it and it broke. I contacted the seller they explained to me about the material of the glasses and asked me my address to send a new set even just one was broken, great customer service and understanding, and the glasses are nice.
"
JEM,5.0,2021 28 April,"
I love the style and size of these wine glasses!  I wanted thin ones and these are just right!I was very impressed in the packaging!  They came in thick foam molded to the shape of each glass, then put in sturdy boxes.I may order more.My husband doesn't care for the style, but I love them!

"
Daniel Vellone,5.0,2021 27 April,"
These are beautiful glasses, just be careful since they are thin and fragile. Haven’t broken them but I can see that one small drop or maybe putting it the wrong way in the dishwasher could break one. Either way it’s a great value and they are beautiful glasses that are great to drink wine out of!
"
Benjamin,5.0,2021 26 January,"
First off we love these glasses and use the regularly. Second the customer service is amazing. I e always hand wash all our glasses. While doing so one of the glasses had a chip that came out while washing. I contacted customer service and 2 days later had a new glass. Thank you so much for standing by your product and have a awesome customer service.
"
Evgenia Glazunova,5.0,2021 21 July,"
Excellent product! Exactly what I expected! I've been looking for this exact type of wine glasses for a while and was surprised to have found them on Amazon. They are exactly as described. Very happy with the purchase. Also, very convenient that they come in a set of two.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 19 March,"
Others have rated this product low because it is breakable. That isn't surprising with a beautiful wine glass. What was surprising was the amazing and fast customer service. I emailed them that I had broken a glass, they responded immediately to the email and I had a replacement arrive 2 days later. Thank you for doing things right, JBHO.
"
Murph,5.0,2020 17 November,"
I bought these glasses for my daughter’s 27th birthday.  She loves them!  They’re beautiful!  Even though they are sturdy glasses,  my daughter broke one while washing them before using.  I told her about the replacement policy so she wrote to the company.  They replaced her glass immediately upon receiving the order number.  We both would recommend these beautiful glasses and would purchase them again!
"
Sirus,5.0,2021 13 August,"
Im very happy with your company and the response i received when i reached out concerning a broken glass. I received 2 brand new stems within a couple days. The product is wonderfully made and i will put them to good use.
"
Faith Flaherty,2.0,2022 8 March,"
These seemed really nice at first with a beautiful shape. However, they are incredibly fragile to the point of being a waste of time. I bought two and both shattered in my hands. I don’t have strong hands and am not rough with my dishes. One shattered when being washed, the other when being towel dried. These lasted a month and a half. Not worth it at all.
"
TR,4.0,2021 16 January,"
I love the shape, but they are a little too delicate for me to feel safe using them much. I have bad luck with wine glasses. I bought some stemless that I use more often.

These glasses may be delicate but are absolutely beautiful. And the customer service is just amazing. They go above and beyond. Thank you.
"
Anna Robertson,5.0,2021 8 July,"
I really love these. You can tell they are genuinely hand blown from slight imperfections making them quite charming. They are very thin and satisfing to drink from. I drink all my wine from these glasses, even though that's not the technical ""correct"" way to do it.
"
Joanne T.,5.0,2020 29 December,"
Love these glasses. Beautiful and elegant. Love drinking out of them. They are very large compared to my other wine glasses. Come beautifully packaged and fast delivery. Would make a great gift for two. I ordered them for myself because I love drinking wine. Using mine as I write this. Even makes cheap wine taste expensive. Lol I would definitely recommend.

DH,4.0,2020 7 October,"
I was surprised how very thin the neck on the glasses is. The glass is beautiful but they seem so delicate that one wrong move and it will break. Hope they last longer than I think they will.
"
M.R.,5.0,2021 17 January,"
The first time we used these glasses was Christmas Eve and our guests had so many compliments.  They are an amazing deal for the price.  They are a bit more delicate than the photos indicate, but they are SO pretty.  The bowl is quite large and will hold a substantial pour.  Great find!
"
Carlos,4.0,2021 2 April,"
It's a little too big for my taste, and it seems like it would break extremely easy because of how thin it is.
"
abhi,4.0,2021 10 April,"
Great glasses, but very thin and the durability is low. Break with the slightest touch, all of my set broke eventually,
"
Michelle R.,4.0,2020 4 August,"
They have a great shape and look to them.  The packaging was very well done so they arrived in perfect condition. The glasses however are paper thin and don’t seem to be very durable so I would be careful of clinking them together.

The size and shape are just what I was looking for- they are large and feel good to hold.I had an issue with one of the glasses upon delivery and customer service was more than happy to send me a new set ASAP.  I would definitely recommend these glasses and I will be buying more in the future.  Thanks!

We received our wine glasses promptly and they were beautiful & sturdy.  However, one of the glasses had a chip in it that made it unusable.  I contacted the merchant directly via E-Mail Message, advised of the issue with the one wine glass, and the merchant very promptly replied to my message, advising they would send me a new set of glasses.  Within days, I received a new set of wine glasses in perfect condition.  I would definitely recommend these glasses!

Nitro Rider,4.0,2021 20 April,"
Really nice looking. Eye catching shape. Very thin so be careful handling or these will break.
"
Ada Andrade,5.0,2021 13 August,"
The glasses are beautiful. When one of them broke I contacted their customer service and they responded immediately! I received a free replacement immediately from them. I would buy from them again!
"
Bailey Thompson,1.0,2022 22 March,"
I loved these with all my heart. The shape is exactly what I wanted, but a fly could land on them and they would break. The first one, we used warm water to wash, and the heat shattered it. They wouldn’t replace it without a picture, but we had already cleaned up the shards. We just bought more since it was $25. Two more broke back to back from the very gentle cleaning (seriously, we were GENTLE), after the corner of the brush bumped (not hit, barely bumped) the glass. The last one just shattered and we don’t even know what happened to it. The closest thing we did to it was close some blinds about a foot from them and then poof, a thousand shards.I hate when people exaggerate in reviews and we always ignore those comments and move on. Don’t ignore them here. These will not last you a month, even though they are beautiful.
"
Em Minion,5.0,2021 13 November,"
The shape is beautiful and I get many compliments about it!

Nancy M.,3.0,2021 22 September,"
One glass broke already and I just bought in June.  It says guaranteed but I can't find out how to get in touch with the company.
"
Charles ,5.0,2020 26 July,"
I wanted a modern red wine glass, and this one fits the bill. I could have spent more, but I would not have obtained the value I got with this glass. I could have spent less, but the style and quality were much lower. I spent a lot of time on Amazon's website looking at all of the red wine glasses and believe I made the right choice.
"
J.A. Strockbine,3.0,2021 23 October,"
My understanding of this product is that they are crystal, (although attractive) they simply they are not.
"
Klara,5.0,2021 13 September,"
I love these wine glasses. We did break them within the first week but that's on us. Loved them and getting more.
"
Mikae,5.0,2020 23 January,"
I have been wanting to have very good wine glasses for my boyfriend who doesn't have a set of glasses. All he has are collection from hotels where he stayed (Awww....lol). They are all odd shape and not very good quality. Over the holidays, I finally purchased a set for him (I needed for my 2000 Bordeaux that I wanted to open). We were presently surprised with quality and sleek looking. With this, any wine looks very expensive! The price is so affordable and can't beat.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 3 July,"
These are just stunning, beautiful look and great for red wine. I did have one them break, but it was replaced in less than a week by the seller. Love the customer support as much as much as the glasses.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 15 March,"
WOW quite the surprise. I had a minor complaint and the seller sent two additional boxes of wine glasses I am Super Impressed with the customer service. I will def use this vendor in the future and highly recommend them. Thanks  they are beautiful and packed perfectly
"
michael,5.0,2020 6 June,"
I love these glasses. Makes even crappy wine feel like an expensive one with the glass. Customer service is top notch. I clumsily broke my first 2 glasses, so I bought another set. 1 of the new glasses broke while cleaning it. I contacted them, and they sent me out 2 more glasses free of charge.  Beautiful but fragile being thin and hand blown, but well worth it!
"
Andrea,5.0,2020 18 June,"
These wine glasses are beautiful and elegant to drink out of but I have to rave about the customer service.  I had put some ice in the glass and when an ice cube hit the side it broke.  I took a picture of it and the company sent me 2 new glasses - no questions asked!  I will be buying more in the future!
"
marlena janes,5.0,2021 20 March,"
***update*** after writing the glass had broke, the company quickly sent out a replacement! Only one glass broke, but they sent the set of two after about 2 days. Great customer service!!Broke with cold Sangria, NOT durable with ice which is kind of ridiculous!
"
Josef  Morphis,5.0,2021 25 August,"
Love the bowl of the glass, it delivers the wine perfectly to your palate. Love the shape, looks very classy and very affordable
"
Rumbi M.,5.0,2020 1 November,"
Gorgeous glasses! The packaging was incredibly safe and secure, with styrofoam and extra padding outside of the box. The glasses themselves are beautiful and lightweight. I have used them a few times already and so far no issues. As far as durability, I am sure they will last depending on how careful they are handled. Would definitely purchase again.
"
Aldo A. Molina,5.0,2021 13 September,"
Copa grande para deleitar el sabor y el olor del vino. Muy buen acabado y cristal ligero.
"
TPorter,5.0,2021 18 July,"
These look and feel great. They seem quite fragile as they’re thin glass but so far they’re holding up well.  Haven’t tried them in the dishwasher have only hand washed them.
"
Oday,5.0,2021 22 May,"
These glasses are so nice, perfect for entertaining. I always get compliments on them. Be careful when handling, they are delicate but worth the handle :) Also, this company has great customer service. Very responsive and so helpful.
"
Katarena Ford,5.0,2020 9 October,"
These glasses are super cute and easily my favorite. However, they have more of a plastic feel but they break like glass. One of my glasses broke in the sink. I emailed the company and they shipped me a free set with no questions asked. They were nice and professional - 5 stars for customer service
"
DJ ,5.0,2021 12 March,"
They are quite elegant. Simply gougeous. You may need to be very gentle with them however. It’s very fine glass so I’m sure it will be easily broken, however I like how light they are. I don’t like heavy glasses when drinking wine.
"
Jasper Acosta,4.0,2020 25 August,"
These a beautiful wine glasses. It is a little thin, but so far it holds perfectly. It came in a foam box with the designers card. I would purchase again.
"
Todd,5.0,2021 25 April,"
Ordered two sets of these just before the holidays and we loved them so much, we decided to order another couple of sets.  Great quality, no bubbling or pock marks in the glass.  Would definitely recommend.
"
Alondra,5.0,2020 14 November,"
I was a little worried after reading all the reviews. I received my order today and may I say great purchase. I had been looking for something like this for a while now. Beautifully packaged and designed perfectly. To each their own but I’m buying this for all my friends this Xmas.
"
Dixie L,5.0,2020 6 February,"
If you like to ""release the esters"" &/ ""admire the legs"" you gotta check it these wine glasses.  Plus, they are as beautiful as they are functional.  A wide bowl base on a long, slender stem assures that your wine reaches your palate with maximum flavor and bouquet.  And yes, wine does taste better from crystal stems.  Frazier Crane would recommend these wine glasses, as do I.  Cheers!
"
Cassie Stebelton,4.0,2020 11 July,"
Broke very easily. I asked my husband to hand me my glass and it literally broke in his hand and cut his hand. But they are beautiful. Just be extremely careful with them!
"
Charles,5.0,2020 9 September,"
6/19/22 update: I had a wine glass break and the seller replaced it quickly and without hassle. Hands down the best experience with a seller.  If you’re looking for a well shaped and high quality wine glass, look nowhere else. Original review: Fantastic. Exactly what we were looking for. Nice and tall and high quality.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 3 October,"
I’m happy with this product for me, not as a gift.
"
BasicB,5.0,2021 5 September,"
Elegant look and feel, but also fragile as is true with most fine crystal.
"
Jimmy Wojcik,5.0,2021 14 July,"
Love the shape and size, I’m not sure how durable they are, because of the stem, but all good glasses are a little delicate.  Love them.
"
Dolly,5.0,2021 19 October,"
Great price for delicate crystal wine glasses.
"
Casey,5.0,2020 10 June,"
I haven't ever bought nice glasses for myself, usually I go to the discount section at Target but decided to splurge a bit and oh my goodness I'm glad I did. These are so lightweight I'm afraid I'll break them, but they have held up so far! Gives me a great excuse to drink some nice red wine after a long day.
"
cesar gonzalez,5.0,2021 31 January,"
Great wine glasses. They are thin so careful when washing and drying them. Although they are thin up top, the base and stem look and feel sturdy and the glass is over all very elegant. This buy was worth it
"
G,3.0,2020 29 July,"
Great shape and style of Glass. Only downfall is how thin the glass is. If its on the edge of a table when setting it down the glass is done. There is suppose to be A lifetime replacement. I have reached out since I have already broke one but I haven't heard anything back. Reason for the three stars. Ill probably just start buying glasses in person so I know the size and weight before I take them home
"
Booklover,5.0,2021 1 May,"
These are gorgeous glasses. They've become my favorite, go-to wine glasses, for either red or white. Perfect size and shape and such an elegant feel. Have already ordered more.
"
Tom Eastwood,3.0,2021 9 June,"
Wow!  These wine glasses are beautiful and the taste of our wine was much better than out of our old glasses.  However, they do not feel like crystal glass.  They feel and sound like plastic?? 😔
"
KC,4.0,2020 1 June,"
These are very nice but when I opened the box the stems where broken. If you get these glasses just be very careful with the stems; they are very thin.
"
Lavern,4.0,2021 2 February,"
Very nice but bigger than I expected. Great gift
"
Charlotte Grimmett,5.0,2020 3 June,"
These wine glasses are stunning. They have a long thin stem that’s so elegant to hold, they’re incredibly lightweight, and yet still feel so durable at the same time. I was nervous ordering glass off of amazon but they have the packaging down perfectly, I see no possible way one of these could break in transit. Fantastic product!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 12 October,"
Meet my expectations— good gift idea
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 26 November,"
I really loves these glasses , as I was pulling them out of the box my biggest fear was worrying if they'd be broken or not due to them being fragile. But they came on time and are extremely excellent . I have no complaints over hear , any time I drink wine I use these glasses and I plan on buying another set because they were so well . Thank you !
"
Cynthia,5.0,2020 23 December,"
These glasses are very pretty.  they allow for the wine to breath right in the bowl feature of the glass.  A beautiful selection of stem ware for the table and use to dress up any occasion.
"
RosiePosie,5.0,2021 18 July,"
Love these wine glasses!! So beautiful & light. Great for red wine lovers. Amazing customer service!! Highly recommend!
"
sarah,5.0,2021 18 May,"
Nice glass. It’s thin but it’s not meant to be super thick. You’re getting a classy wine glass not a beer mug 🍷
"
María Gabriela Balsa,1.0,2022 21 October,"
Both glasses broke while hand washing them! Ridiculous! I want a refund
"
veronica kon,4.0,2020 15 August,"
I like the shape and looks but they are so light and fragile. Thought they will be little heavier.
"
David Cobb,3.0,2021 13 July,"
Good shape. Very thin side walls. Had less than 2 weeks and one snapped stem. Surprised the body didnt go on them yet.
"
Pamela hillan,5.0,2021 4 July,"
Seemed very delicate and perhaps easily breakable. Packaging was excellent though.  Time will tell. Liked the size and design.
"
Alexandra Dykhuis,5.0,2020 21 September,"
I bought 2 sets of these wine glasses and absolutely love them! I did have an incident of 1 breaking while hand washing, however after contacting the seller they sent me a new set with no questions asked! Love these glasses and this company!
"
Natacha,5.0,2020 15 November,"
I searched high and los for affordable but high quality red wine glasses on Amazon and these surpassed expectations! Classic yet modern at the same time, love how the shape is subtly unique, excellent quality - will purchase more!
"
Christina Raskin,4.0,2020 22 July,"
Beautiful glasses, the only negative is they are very light so very delicate. More for special occasions than daily use
"
Lindsey,5.0,2020 2 November,"
Love love LOVE these glasses! I was washing one last night and dropped it in my sink so one sadly broke...Not the most durable (thin dainty glass) but they are amazing for drinking! Glad I still have one left lol
"
monica woodard,5.0,2021 30 April,"
Glasses are beautiful. Company is very nice and friendly! First set was destroyed during transport, the company express shipped be a new set immediately! Happy customer!
"
sophialjp,2.0,2022 16 January,"
They look good but don’t clean up well. They don’t fit in dishwasher so have to be washed by hand. I soak them with water and soap over night and then wash with wine glass mop, hot water, and soap. Never clean up perfectly.
"
carolineg,3.0,2021 27 March,"
Used these glasses a few times for wine and LOVED them. But, used one to make a Aperol spritz with ice and after putting in 2 ice cubes carefully, the glass popped out a perfect circular hole in the side. Very strange.
"
Linda,5.0,2021 13 May,"
but elegance is, and these glasses are elegant. Yes, as others have said, they require a gentle touch when washing, but they're worth it!
"
Nomacgenius,1.0,2021 26 May,"
The good:  What my wife and I like about these wine glasses is the wide bowl, which helps get a good smell of the wine and helps the wine breathe. The not so good: After about 5-6 uses and carefully washing the glasses, a glass broke.  Since we’ve owned Reidel glasses, we’ve learned how to carefully hand-wash a wine glass, so we were surprised when suddenly, while rinsing a glass, it cracked.  Per JBHO’s guarantee, we reported the breakage to them and they replaced it.  However, it happened again (see the pic).  We contacted JBHO and they said, “We are sorry that we cannot help you. Order: 113……. has been applied for after-sale replacement service through the Amazon system.“. They were referencing the replacement for the first breakage!  I explained to them in 2 separate emails the mistake they were making, but no luck (they didn’t even respond the second time).  So, although it’s a nice glass, because of its fragile, thin style, and lack of customer support, I wouldn’t recommend it.
"
Don Quick,5.0,2021 5 October,"
Great gift per recipient
"
Chris Cancienne,5.0,2021 12 July,"
Great product and customer service. Fast response from customer service. We love our glasses. Thank you.
"
Katelyn Brech,5.0,2020 25 October,"
I am over the moon about these wine glasses! They are beautiful. I have upped my wine intake since I bought them because I love them so much. Very delicate but holds up. I have been recommending them to everyone!!
"
Sarah,5.0,2021 24 January,"
They’re gorgeous. But, very thin and super lightweight. Perfect glasses, actually, just not much substance to them and unfortunately they met their doom rather quickly. But, I’ll be buying another set regardless
"
RKR,5.0,2021 30 July,"
Elegant Italian hand blown wine glasses. Makes you feel special when enjoying your wine.
"
Egbert Bradley,5.0,2020 2 June,"
The glasses arrived today in perfect condition--no cracks, chips, or defects of any kind. I drink white wine and don't care if these are supposed to be for red wine. I drink out of glasses with a pleasing shape and a generous volume. The shape and volume of these are perfect
"
Danielle Duncan,5.0,2021 14 April,"
These are beautiful and perfect and I LOVE LOVE LOVE them, I would but more anytime any day just don't have an occasion right now.
"
Jill McHugh,5.0,2021 5 January,"
I love the look of these glasses and I really like how large they are. They are thin like many mentioned but if you take care of them they should last. Definitely recommend.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 13 January,"
They look durable - and are a very nice shape and size - they were a gift and I just spoke with the person I gifted them to and she loves them.
"

I absolutely love these wine glasses! They are very elegant, just perfect!
"
Karla V,5.0,2020 27 June,"
Beautiful glasses! I bought 4, now buying 4 more! Packaging was perfect, there was no damage on the glasses themselves or the boxes they arrived in. I’m obsessed! Can’t wait to serve everyone wine in these glasses. They are very fragile, so I will be hand washing them.
"
Andrea Fortaleza,5.0,2021 26 April,"
These glasses are stunning however for the price I wish I would have at least gotten  a set of 4
"
Aron Oliveras,4.0,2020 9 April,"
My dog slightly tipped the table and it gently caressed the table top.  Crack!  I wish they were sturdier, but they're beautiful!

The first order came defective but after I sent them an email they were happy to replace them. Absolutely wonderful customer service!
"
Robert,5.0,2021 23 April,"
Love these wine glasses, poured a glass of Bordeaux. Decanted well and was light and easy to hold while socializing.
"
danielle,3.0,2020 8 June,"
Hi guys! Be weary if you are looking for glasses with the material of crystal here, these feel like they are some material between glass and plastic, very durable, but nothing like some of my nice dinner party glasses I was looking for a substitute for (crate and barrel) beautiful design, but not the material I was expecting to get for the price.
"
blair morrow,5.0,2020 27 March,"
These are the only wine glasses I’ll ever buy again! The wine glasses themselves are stylish and amazing, but the best part is the fabulous customer service. The wine glasses are very sturdy, but if you do happen to break one, all it takes is one email and they send you a replacement.
"
Ilovedeyto,5.0,2021 25 February,"
These glasses are absolutely stunning - just using these glasses makes it an enjoyable experience having a nice glass of wine. I highly recommend them!
"
Lucas Trujillo,3.0,2021 19 April,"
Love the look and the light feel of these glasses. Unfortunately one broke, I know they have a replacement policy, but can’t find a email to notify them. Now I  just have the one.

"
Kerry Connell,5.0,2021 2 January,"
We were told there was a product guarantee on this product- burgundy wine glass. We broke the stem on one washing it and would like the replacement as promised.
"
Rachel,5.0,2020 22 August,"
Beautiful, thin-lipped, well-balanced, elegantly lightweight glasses. Yes, they are delicate and fragile but fine wine glasses should be. I did have one break but the seller was very responsive and quick to replace the glass. I couldn’t be happier.
"
Aurora,4.0,2020 17 August,"
They came in a  nice clean package nothing was broke
"
slwebstar!,5.0,2021 14 April,"
These are very pretty and well made. I recommend hand wash and not dishwasher, to extend life of glasses.
"
Dominique McCary,5.0,2021 27 May,"
Bought this back in March and I still have both glasses in good shape
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 28 July,"
These are the perfect red wine glasses that I desperately needed. The hand blown style looks/feels so nice. Highly recommend. I just wish it came in a pack of four, but I will definitely be ordering some more soon!
"
Maia F.,5.0,2021 27 March,"
Love these wine glasses! One of my favorites! Absolutely would recommend if you like a larger sized wine glass.

Packaged very nicely. The feel of the glass seems pretty sturdy and nice to the touch. Beautiful quality!! Thank You!!
"
Robert,5.0,2020 21 September,"
These were to replace a similar set from a different manufacturer. These are just a nice if not nicer. They do seem fragile but that is as expected for this type of stemware.
"
Sue D,5.0,2020 4 August,"
These glasses are elegant yet sturdy, and we love the quality. Been used many times and washed many times since we purchased them. They make sharing a glass of wine with loved ones a pleasure indeed.
"

They are nice; they were loved as a gift, but so very light and easily broken.
"
C Seay,1.0,2022 27 July,"
I've used and hand washed crystal glasses for decades. Gently hand washed when I received. Day 2 had a glass of wine and gently washed and the glass shattered, glass everywhere and of course a couple of cuts. Next time will buy those unbreakable wine glasses.
"
Ryan Jensen,2.0,2022 3 May,"
Perfect size….  They just break really really easy.
"
salegirl,5.0,2020 5 September,"
Beautiful, but delicate, crystal.  They come very well packaged in foam.  The glasses are gorgeous and designed so the wine won’t spill even if you bump the glass.
"
Danelle Abrams,5.0,2021 26 February,"
Received these wind glasses with no damage at all. No fleas, lightweight and larger than I expected.
"
Denise M.,5.0,2021 7 April,"

"
Rick,5.0,2019 17 November,"
These are great wine glasses!  I was looking for a sturdy, yet attractive, Burgundy glass, and I found it!  They seem more fragile than other glasses but are actually pretty sturdy. They are also great glasses to enhance the aromas of the wine. I'm looking forward to checking out their other glasses!
"
Nicole,4.0,2019 29 August,"
We really like these glasses. They do seem delicate and light, but they’re gorgeous. Quick delivery and all perfectly in tact. We ordered 6 and they were all perfect. I would recommend.

These glasses are light weight and huge. Very satisfied with them
"
Lee,5.0,2020 7 February,"
I LOVE these glasses and will buy more!! Love the feel, look, style. However...I cannot speak to durability or sturdiness. Honestly, they feel so dainty (though large bowl and bulbus) and fragile. I just treat them gently and enjoy them till the day comes 😬
"
Monica Flores,1.0,2022 2 October,"
This came in broken.I was very disappointed
"
Kelly Vieira,5.0,2020 16 July,"
These glasses are elegant. The stem is very dainty. I would recommend these glasses as they aerate the wine very well. I've had no issues with the glass trying to tip over.
"
mimi,5.0,2020 21 May,"
I love these glasses so I ordered two more sets.  This set was never es delivered to my home.  I’m sure someone received them.  Was t me.  My 3rd set arrives today
"
Christopher Durham,5.0,2020 21 May,"
Beautiful wine glasses and great customer service! One of the glasses was broken when it arrived and they sent me a new set right away and without any problems. Love the glasses, definitely worth the money!

Beautiful design and quality. Carefully check the glasses. I got one damaged. The packaging was really good, so I guess it was a manufacture issue.
"

Beautiful wine glasses and fantastic customer service.  They are packed so awesomely!
"
Whitney S.,2.0,2021 24 July,"
Durability is absolutely horrible. After hand washing I set the glass upside down in the dish rack to dry, it fell over and broke. Same thing with the second one, except it was sitting in the sink waiting to be washed and my daughter threw a plastic spoon into the sink and it broke the glass.Two stars because the shape was great for aerating cab and pinot.
"
Jenny Pye,5.0,2021 8 March,"
Love, love, love these. My wine taste so good from this beautiful glass.
"
sjessick,5.0,2020 25 February,"
Bought these, and a wine aerator, for my mom, for her Christmas/Bday gift this past 2019. It's now March, 2020. She uses them almost every night, says they look super fancy, and are currently her favorite wine glasses :) I'm happy.
"

These glasses are so beautiful. I bought 2 boxes for my sister as a house warming gift and she loved them.
"
AB,3.0,2020 27 July,"
These glasses are fine but a bit overpriced IMO for wine glasses made in China.  I would not have bought them if the listing clearly stated that these were made in China as shows on the box I received.
"
Danny B,5.0,2021 10 February,"
Excellent glasses! Light weight, thin, crystal one piece glass really enhances the wine experience.
"
Meisha Kinnard,5.0,2020 16 September,"

Lou,5.0,2020 25 December,"
It’s light weight. Real Crystal glass. Love it!!! Looking forward for a glass of red wine.
"
Amazon Customer,2.0,2020 28 October,"
I really like these glasses to enjoy my red wine, but one of them broke while I was just holding it in the sink to wash. I was not squeezing or putting pressure on it, but it still broke. Originally when I bought these glasses, it was listed as lifetime warranty that there'd be a replacement if anything happened to it which was the reason why I even purchased them in the first place, but now I see the policy is a 1 year warranty. I'd love to continue to support, so please advise.
"
BMoore,5.0,2020 1 May,"
I received my glasses today. Encased in foam and boxed with no room. I can not image how these come broken. I am in love and can not wait to use my beautiful glasses.

Love these glasses. They are beautiful and great quality. Also appreciated the great customer service and reach out from the company. Highly recommend if you are looking for a sophisticated wine glass of good quality.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2020 23 September,"
I do like the size and shape of these wine glasses but they are very thin. I have to be very careful washing them because I feel these could break at any moment.
"
Gwendolyn Broady,1.0,2022 13 July,"
Product is NOT glass.  It’s freakin plastic.  Do not buy.  I now have to wrap this cheap crap to return for a refund.  Such a waste of time.  Amazon you need to do better

My wife and I love the quality and shine there so cute .! ❤️

We have had these for several months and they hold up very well!
"
Sarah Villella,3.0,2020 7 May,"
Both glasses have a very noticeable imperfections, right out the box. The glasses are also extra light-weight, i fear break them just placing them in the sink. I waited a month to receive, so i’d rather use them instead of hassle with exchanging.
"
Aubrey,5.0,2021 24 May,"

"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2020 9 December,"
These glasses are cute they they break way too easy. I’ve purchased these twice and both times the glasses cracked. They’re too fragile
"
Casey,1.0,2022 7 July,"
Worthless. So thin that they break at the slightest touch. One was broke in the box. Set up a return and then just decided to use the other one. It broke the second a bottle touched the rim.
"
Chris,2.0,2021 14 November,"
Aside from being paper thin (2 out of 4 already broken within a few months) the openings are too small and feel very awkward on the mouth. I’ll stick to a standard Bordeaux.
"
Boatdog,5.0,2020 21 January,"
Amazing wine glasses for the price. Bought them to have extra on hand at our ski chalet for guest. They were very securely packaged and so elegant we will use them as primary wine glasses! Thank you.
"
Julie Campbell,5.0,2020 14 September,"

"
TNagel,5.0,2019 13 June,"
Did a taste test using regular wine glasses and the JBHome Burgundy Wine Glasses and found that red wine actually tastes smoother and smells better when using these larger, taller glasses. Ordered eight glasses and one arrived broken. Contacted JB Home directly and they promptly replaced the broken glass in two days. Great customer service and great product. Highly recommend!
"
BW,5.0,2020 29 March,"
The product arrived on time and in great shape.  The quality and price is much better comparing to retail shops. Can't wait till I swirl my wine in the glass!
"
Kimberly H,3.0,2020 24 May,"
Beautiful glasses. However one of mine broke at the stem on the second use when I was drying it after rinsing it. I’m not that strong and apparently neither is the glass. But they are so beautiful.
"
Stater,5.0,2021 17 May,"
Feel nice in hand.
"
Susan G.,5.0,2019 26 June,"
I ordered a pair of these glasses but one of them arrived broken. The box didn't have any Styrofoam to protect the glasses nor was it marked fragile.  I'm going to order another pair and hopefully this time they both arrive in good condition.  These glasses are elegant and look very expensive.
"
Katie M.,1.0,2022 13 July,"
Thought it was me that was at fault for breaking the wine glass. My daughter did the same thing, by just placing in the sink for of dish water.  Wouldn’t recommend
"
sammymac,5.0,2021 8 April,"
The glass is of good quality
"
G. Smith,5.0,2019 28 December,"
Very good looking glasses. Feels sturdy and high quality. I will buy more. The packaging was well done too. I saved my box so I could throw theses in the truck to take to the beach.
"
Empowerer,5.0,2020 30 January,"
Holding the glass feels great and the wine looks amazing in them.  I truly enjoy using them, and they feel amazing to hold with good balance.  You won't be disappointed.  Enjoy!

"
jennifer,3.0,2020 25 May,"
They break REALLY easy!!! other then that they were my favorite wine glasses however, the stem is just wayyy too thin . Would i purchase again? If they were more stronger i totally would.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 28 July,"
Packaged very carefully so that they wouldn’t break and they are just beautiful wine glasses for a great price!

"
Richelle Nelson,3.0,2021 26 February,"
Wish the stems were a bit longer. Other than that glasses good!
"
Sarah,2.0,2021 28 March,"
I really liked the look of these glasses and size. But they are paper thin glass, not strong at all. One came with a black spot on it I tried washing it and it didn’t come off. In fact, the glass straight up broke in my hands while gently scrubbing. The second glass broke two days later being set down not gentle enough.
"

"
Elizabeth Crocker,1.0,2022 30 April,"
these are truly the worst wine glasses i’ve ever purchased. BOTH of them broke while i was pouring wine into them (on different occasions). i’ve had wine glasses from the $1 bin at target last longer. my husband is military and we move 2x a year, so that’s saying something. don’t buy these.
"
Dennis P.,5.0,2019 12 December,"

I absolutely love it. It looks beautiful for red or whites. My new favorite wine glass!!
"
Tina B,2.0,2021 18 July,"
Feels so cheap. Being hand-blown I expected them to be special and have some weight. They don’t. They feel like plastic. I bought for present and was going to etch and I waited too long to open the box so I can return. These feel very cheap and plastic. Not special.
"
Krista filek,5.0,2020 3 February,"
Love these wine glasses! Just ordered another pair-had my first pair for a few months and decided it was worth it for some more. Beautiful and lightweight!
"

Amazon Customer,2.0,2021 13 August,"
My wife loved these glasses, however we were sitting on the couch and she picked the glass up and it literally busted into pieces. Wine everywhere....cut finger.....huge mess. I'm not sure if this is a freak thing, but I've never seen anything like it.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 16 September,"
I would recommend these glasses. they are light but very durable.
"
Biker monkey,2.0,2021 31 July,"
These are $5 stems being sold for $15.  A good stemmed wine glass should weigh at least 8 oz, these guys weigh 4.8 ounces.  You can immediately tell the difference hold them... very poor quality for the price.I returned mine.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2020 26 June,"
Just okay... I bought these glasses looking for the best value for the money and was underwhelmed based on the price.

Jamie LB,1.0,2022 21 April,"
The glasses are so fragile that upon cleaning one after viewing with wine in it, shattered in my hand!  Definitely NOT Safe. They are much larger than I thought them to be. Would certainly Not give as a gift.

"
Susan H,2.0,2021 23 January,"
Such a beautiful glass. However, after the second use as I was gently hand washing it, the glass literally shattered!  We were surprised at how ""light"" this glass was considering it's large size.  Very pretty to look at but actually seemed like the weight of plastic when picked up.  Very disappointed.
"
Hugguette,1.0,2022 9 August,"
Broke on the same day
"
Mr. Magoo,5.0,2020 15 June,"

"
Matthew R Lehmkuhler,1.0,2022 16 February,"
Hand washing with a dish rag and the glass broke in my hand. Contacted customer service and they said since they were over a year old they wouldn’t replace them. I agree if it was dropped but hand washing…. After the first time using them…..  not one but two of their glasses.  pretty cheap materials there. Stay away from this company.
"
Taft,1.0,2021 17 April,"
I bought a pair of these wine glasses with plans to buy more if I liked them. The glasses are beautiful and light weight. I think their weight may be a big problem. The second time I used one it shattered in my hand. I was cleaning the glass and it blew up. I know how to handle glass ware. Very gently. I was not holding the glass by the stem.The bowl just shattered into pieces. I have used Riedel for over 40 years and never had this happen. I am tossing the other glass. I feel very fortunate my hand was not cut.

GeriAnne,1.0,2021 3 December,"
Do NOT waste your $$ on these! I saw an Instagram influencer use them and Altho they look beautiful they are garbage! One of mine cracked immediately after a few uses. I kept using its twin but literally just cracked it a few moments while hand washing it which is what motivated me to write this for the next potential buyer. Actually they have a plasticky feel. Please don’t waste your $ on these terrible wine glasses. Ugh!!

They are very lightweight and thin. Beautiful glasses, but I fear that they will break easily.
"
CC,1.0,2022 8 February,"
These glasses are incredibly light. That might seem like a good thing but actually when you put liquid in them the liquid makes it top-heavy so it’s easy to spill and difficult to navigate. One of mine has broken already and I’ve only had it a few days. Not worth it.
"
Sergiu,4.0,2019 17 August,"
4 star
"
nl,2.0,2021 24 March,"
They are gorgeous to look at. But like other purchasers, I broke one within 5 mins of receiving it because its SO thin. I was gentle with it too. So... I have one. We'll see how long it lasts.

"
Eclectic Reader,1.0,2021 6 May,"
These are lovely glasses, but they are just TOO fragile! The two I purchased are already broken. Had them less than 6 weeks. The first shattered as I was hand washing it. I mean it literally crumbled in my hands. The second cracked when I put ice cubes in it. Again, I placed them in. The ice cubes did not come shooting out an automatic fridge dispenser. I am so disappointed, and kinda mad because these might as well have been disposable, I. ran through them so fast.
"
S&H,1.0,2021 24 March,"
Always read the 1's and 2's in the reviews. I find them more helpful than the pumped-up 5s. Wine glass broke by barely holding it carefully while washing it. Even if you lightly tap this wine glass, it will break at the stem. I'm returning this as defective. If you want an attractive wine glass that simply sits on a shelf for view, this would be fine. If you are going to use them or wash them, high chance they will break. FYI. Don't make me say ""I told ya so.""

Julia,1.0,2021 25 December,"
Glasses are very attractive however came with etches on the globes and extremely thin.  They advertise Italian Handblown Glass yet box says Made in China, AND there’s a crease in one of the globes (which I can’t seem to get in a picture for this review) as if it was made in a mold!!?Buyers Beware

This item is was very nice upon unpackaging, but I used it once, washed it, and on the 2nd use I had 3 pieces of ice inside with wine and a chunk of the middle of the glass broke out.Considering the price, the quality of these is not up to par. Very disappointed.

"
Lucinda Bergins,1.0,2020 13 July,"
Oh no, I’m so extremely disappointed. I’m a huge crystal glassware fanatic. I am building a collection and have been happy with most items from amazon. However, I received these glasses today and thought it be great with my Italian dinner and wine tonight. I washed them gently and dried with my glass cloth, the wine glass literally broke into pieces in my hand, the other one was wine at the same handling. This came as a shock to me. I’m not sure if the item is defective or if this is just a weak product. This has never happened to me before.
"
Joe La,2.0,2021 9 April,"

"
B416G64,2.0,2020 27 October,"
I bought 2 sets-4 glasses and the first one broke right away. I was barely touching it. Two others soon followed. They look and feel very nice, but they are unreasonably fragile. I was so careful.

I don't enjoy the texture of these wine glasses. They're too thin for me
"
QalaLover,2.0,2019 22 November,"
I ordered these as a gift for a colleague. I'm so glad I didn't ship them straight to him. These are not delicate crystal glasses as described. I was hoping for something comparable to a Reidel glass like others had described. These are so heavy and chunky, they've got to be pure glass, not crystal at all. They're going back.

Latrice Reed,1.0,2022 7 April,"
One of the glasses broke already because glass was so thin. I wouldn’t recommend!!!
"
Levi ,2.0,2020 23 September,"
It broke while I was hand washing it! Like what, they are just not durable enough. Pretty disappointed because now I have 1 wine glass that has no matching glass in my house.

"
Felicia Sullivan,2.0,2020 13 August,"
I bought these twice and while they are beautiful, they break SO easily. I haven’t had these a month and one already broke while I was DELICATELY hand washing them. Never again.
"
Jasna Ortagus,1.0,2021 6 October,"
The glasses look  really pretty but are horrible quality. I had one break in my hand while washing it. It didn’t hit the counter or anything I just squeezed it a little to hold it bc my hands were soapy and it just broke In half. 😔

if you have wine and toss your glasses in the dish washer these are not for you. one broke in the washer one got tipped over on a hardwood floor and broke easily.

"
Ana D.,1.0,2021 18 December,"
One of them shattered in my hands when I was cleaning the rim. Was using the same force as washing other glasses. Very pretty but would have purchased something more strong
"
Alexandra G,2.0,2020 3 October,"
Cheap glasses for an expensive price. They have to be made out of plastic as I dropped one by accident and it didn’t break or crack.
"
Sean P. Melia,2.0,2020 5 April,"
I accidentally bought the set of 2 rather than the set of 4, which means I paid over $10/glass.  Not worth it!  I'm not expecting these glasses to last more than a few months.
"
Zoe,5.0,2019 11 September,"

Jenny Bankston,1.0,2021 7 October,"
I was hand washing these glasses and drying them when the stem broke in half in my hand cutting me severely and causing me to get stitches. This is usually a reputable brand so I’m very disappointed.

Lauren,2.0,2020 20 September,"
I’ve had this glass less than a week and it broke when I was washing it by hand....what a shame it’s a beautiful glass
"
Kindle Customer,2.0,2021 21 January,"
This product is extremely thin and breaks without warning. It is not worth the money.
"
JGamble,1.0,2020 22 December,"
Loved the way the glass looked but one arrived shattered and the other broke while hand washing. I’ve only had the surviving glass for a couple of weeks before it shattered in my hands while hand washing. Thankfully I didn’t suffer any injury and only the glass shattered in the basin of my sink but it was disappointing. I cannot recommend these poor quality glasses. Look elsewhere.
"
Krystal Lunsford,2.0,2019 18 June,"
Very low quality glasses. They look and feel cheap. The glass isn’t very clear and smudges up with every touch. By the time you finish drinking a glass of wine, the glass is completely smudged and unable to wipe off. I would not recommend these glasses.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 31 December,"
Great product
"
Michele S.,1.0,2019 24 December,"
I washed these glasses and put my hand inside one of them to dry it with a standard dish towel and it broke into many pieces. I was not exerting undue pressure when this happened.  Needless to say I didn’t attempt to dry the other glass I am not sure how long it will last but I’m certain not long as I picked up the pieces I could tell that they were paperthin. I love a nice thin crystal wine glass but that was ridiculous.

"
Gina De Stefano,1.0,2021 15 February,"
I’m so sad! I thought these were durable wine glasses! They came in a beautiful case and they both broke in a month of having them! I never dropped them and used them according to directions and both cracked randomly! I wish I could return but I had to throw both out :(
"
Swiftlink,1.0,2021 30 September,"
For a glass that's brand new n jus came out of a box it's very dirty bought it to do a product shoot very disappointing to try cleaning something that should be new

One came broken and was hard to get replacement
"
VLee,1.0,2020 4 August,"
The glasses are beautiful but very thin! I ordered one set. Got them, loved the look so much I ordered an extra set for a small dinner I was having. Within the first week of having them I broke 3 of the 4!!! I love nice wine glasses and really wished these were made with more durability. I wasted 40 bucks, as I am left with one glass only after one week of use!
"
Jacob,2.0,2020 4 November,"

Amazon Customer,1.0,2020 17 August,"
Got these glasses less than 1 month ago. Within 2weeks I found a crack in one glass. I only hand wash these glasses. And today, as I was hand drying the other glass, it shattered in my hand. I wasn’t convinced these were glass when they arrived. They didn’t have that glass ring but after it broke in my hand, I know they are glass. Would not recommend.
"
FromCT,1.0,2020 14 December,"
So Fragile!  Bought 8 of these “beautiful to look at” wine glasses. While lovely in appearance, they are so very fragile. The simple act of hand washing them caused two of them to break. The glass is very thin and these glasses are not suitable for everyday use.

Kim Vaughn,1.0,2020 17 June,"
They're very pretty and fun wine glasses but they are incredibly thin. I had them for a few days before my mom accidentally hit hers with her phone and it immediately shattered. Then, only two days later, I poured a drink in mine and an ice cube poked a hole in it and suddenly everything poured out. Unfortunate wast of money. :/
"
JackK,5.0,2019 17 August,"
Great
"
praine,1.0,2020 10 August,"
These glasses are sooooo thin. Just holding one feels like it will shatter!!  They come packaged sandwiched in a thick foam, which is great. So I decided to store my glasses in this protective foam....my glass shattered simply by gently placing it back in the foam!!  Granted they didn't cost much...but NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!
"
Shannon Long,1.0,2021 17 June,"

These wine glasses are truly beautiful but do not purchase. They are extremely flimsy. As I was merely taking it out of the box, one glass broke in my hand. These are not Reidel quality at all. Do not purchase. Buyer beware- so it does not happen to you.

The stem snapped in my fingers while wiping down the glass.  I was not applying hard pressure, merely running a cloth around the outside of the glass. These were new,  never used.
"
Brittney,1.0,2021 4 March,"
These cups almost have Oreo thins beat. The thinnest glass I’ve never seen. Do not recommend for a gift, they’ll definitely call you a,”cheap skate”

Pouring wine in the glass broke a perfect circle in the side of the glass. Glasses blown too thin to hold up to a pour on the first use.

Well, I had them a week before I broke one hand washing it. I am a red wine drinker and always wash my glasses by hand and every once in a while I might have one break but I’ve never had one just last a week -they’re very thin. I am not a bull in a China shop I have a lot of breakables and I don’t usually break things that easy so I was a little surprised.  I’m going to get another pair and see how it goes. I do like the glass shape.
"

"
Anna,5.0,2021 27 May,"
These glasses are soooo nice.  Sent them as a gift. I had the opportunity to drink some wine from one and they are of high quality.  The ""clinking"" sound for a toast is superb.  I know that seems like a weird compliment, but once you do it with these glasses, you'll understand.  I now want a set for my house.
"
Loekie,5.0,2021 3 May,"
This was a present for someone, from a bridal shower registry.  Can't give opinion.  But since it was on recipients registry, I assume they like it.
"
DasK,3.0,2021 6 May,"
I got the glasses as a birthday gift and they really are beautiful but I only got to use one of them one time and it broke while I was hand washing it, the second one broke while I was washing it out for the first time before I even got to use it. So in terms of durability and sturdiness I only gave it one star as that are very thin and delicate and doesn't take much for them to break.I'm very disappointed that I barely got to use this gift.I emailed the company and I haven't heard back yet. I am hoping that that will replace them for me.
"

Bought this as a mother's day gift. One came with the stem broken and the box was perfectly fine. I am so scared of the durability and that the second glass will break easily and that i have wasted my money. Idk how to contact the seller because I don't really want to go through the whole process of returning one broken glass.

"
Jackie Skye,5.0,2021 25 September,"
These glasses are gorgeous. Have I used them yet? No. Am I going to use them soon? Oh, most definitely. I’m a little saddened there were only two glasses for that price but totally my fault for not reading properly. The card that comes with these glasses is the most legit business card I’ve seen. Seriously, it’s made of unicorn tears or something because it’s so soft and smooth. The packaging is legit- love me some good ol’ Fort Knox style safety packaging and this was exactly that. I’ll update if anything goes wrong but for now… I’m a satisfied customer.P.S. the card said to leave a review in a neutral manner but I just couldn’t not include some of these strong adjectives.
"
kapplejack,4.0,2020 3 September,"
I feel so fancy when sipping wine from these glasses! The shape is lovely and looks expensive. They are easy to clean, easy to store, and they were packaged very well in shipping. They are on the thin side, so I worry that if I ever knocked the stem into something that it would snap off easily, and they certainly would not survive a fall from even a foot off the ground. However, I love the look of them and would buy more if I ever do break one.
"
A. Cheek,5.0,2021 26 September,"
Love these wine glasses. They’re beautifully crafted. We received our first set and loved them so much that we ordered a second. Being hand blown, each set has slightly different thickness levels. When we received the second set, one of the stems was so thin that it snapped getting it out of the box. I contacted the seller and they were swift at replacing the set. I would definitely recommend purchasing, and I’ll prob continue to buy more to add to our collection. They also make a beautiful gift.
"
Carly krueger,4.0,2020 21 April,"

"
bmo,5.0,2020 30 March,"
One of the glasses was damaged in transit. The company responded to me immediately and began the replacement process. I got the new glass within a few days.On to the glasses - they are beautiful. Thin glass, no lip, great balance and feel. I think they'd hold up to glasses 3 or 4 times their price in comparison. I am really happy with them and will likely buy more int he future.Thank you!
"
Erica Grant,5.0,2020 10 September,"
Omg these are so beautiful!! I bought this for a potential dinner party but I have no friends. I’ll probably do a wine tasting by myself. One glass red and the other white.. now I’m on to something ill get dressed and make one of those board things!.. off to Michaels
"
Carabella RIazzo,5.0,2020 14 August,"
I'm not very impressed by sellers anymore, but these glasses are excellent. Thick safe packaging, none of my glasses came broken & I ordered 3 boxes. Loved the fragile label on the box. I can't wait to use them!
"
Michael ,5.0,2020 2 July,"
Bought two glasses. Love everything about them. There was a bubble in one. They give you a contact card in the box. So I was going to write about the bubble, but the address doesn’t link to anything. So ill live with it. But really these glasses are beautiful and a bargain!

Lucia Lu,1.0,2021 1 March,"
This has to be the worst purchased I’ve ever made. I literally just got my cup a min ago I went to wash it so I could use it and it broke while washing it. I was very gentle because the material is very cheap and still broke. Do not waste your money, do not fall for these fake reviews saying “this great and very durable”. They probably got store credit to give a fake review. I’m so mad I wasted my money on these when I could’ve had gotten a better option at target.

Joe D.,5.0,2021 7 December,"
Love the shape and size.  Very easy to Swirl and Sniff due to the large barrel base.  Light in weight.
"
Aaron,4.0,2021 4 October,"
Expensive and high-quality, just like the red Burgundy they are designed for -Wine is not an affordable pleasure in life since the Trump tariffs and Covid inflation and climate crisis’ driving up alcohol percentages and causing drought, delivering a blow to winemakers. Wine lovers foot the bill.
"
steve won,5.0,2021 26 October,"
I originally gave it a poor rating because the lack of sturdiness. The customer reached out to me explain how the glass are made and also offered to replace it free of charge. Therefore, I can’t complain about their service as they were really friendly. The glass has been great this time around. Thank You!

"
Tori,4.0,2021 27 February,"
So, I was on the hunt for some very wide hipped wine glasses because I just love how they look. These kept coming up when I searched for them and after I read the reviews I just got them. You can’t tell from the photos but trust me, they are VERY wide at the hip and so gorgeous! Did not come broken, and nice thin stem. If you are thinking about getting these and you like a nice wide bowl, DO SO!!EDIT: About a day ago my mom went to wash one of the glasses and it unfortunately shattered in her hand. I came to realize that these are maybe more plastic than glass? Definitely not the best quality.ANOTHER UPDATE: Reached out to seller and got 2 more THE NEXT DAY! Awesome customer service. I would just advise that you be super super careful with these when cleaning and handling.
"

nice looking glasses.  I get lots of complements
"
JadedBeauty,5.0,2021 28 March,"
I love these wine glasses they’re elegant and delicate. I can’t speak to the durability, I actually don’t think they’re durable at all. But the arrived in tact and haven’t broken yet. I don’t think they’ll last forever, someone will break these eventually. Just enjoy them while they last.
"
Lettie ×o,4.0,2021 30 March,"
Absolutely beautiful! And huge! Love drinking my red wine out of them, however they are VERY DANGEROUSLY THIN! I’ll break one soon, I know it. But if you’re not clumsy like me it’s definitely worth the purchase.

"
Jana A.,5.0,2021 8 October,"
Needed to replace some Riedel red wine glasses that developed an ire-movable fog (I tried everything!) I like the shape and bought 6 total so 3 boxes 2 glasses per box. The packaging was extraordinary and all 6 glasses were in perfect condition. When you run your finger around the base or lip of the glass it sings. These are crystal and fragile so will be hand washing these glasses as I want them to last.
"
Wendy Schuller,5.0,2021 16 August,"
They sent me a free wine glass when one of the glasses I ordered had a small defect. The glass I ordered had a small black dot that I wasn't sure would come off when washing. I told the company and they quickly set me a replacement glass AND another free glass for the trouble. Now I have a set of 6 glasses! On top of that, the email they responded with was so sweet and personal. They hoped my family was safe during the pandemic. How sweet! Love the company and the glasses are GORGEOUS!
"
MARLENE TREJO,5.0,2022 7 September,"
I love these! They feel so big and lux and I love drinking wine out of these!But these are NOT glass — if that matters to you.
"
Meg Zarnick,4.0,2021 17 February,"
I would have given these a 4-5 star for their beauty but to fragile. I had these for less than a year, alway hand washed and dried. Noticed the other that glass was cracked and a section of the glass popped out when I touched with finger. Should not have happened. Disappointing. Would have to give a 1 star because of this.

"
Julia Ronyai,1.0,2021 15 March,"
I've had these for a little over a month and have always been extremely gentle because they are verrrry thin. Just went to refill my glass and barely touched the top of the glass and to my immense surprise a huge chunk just broke off! Figured they were low quality but this confirms it haha definitely not worth the money imo
"
K. Shankman,5.0,2021 25 November,"
these wine glasses are just what I was hoping for:  they're beautiful and elegant looking.  They hold a LOT of wine, though, so you need to be careful--what I consider a standard glass of wine (150-200 ml) takes up 1/3 or less of these glasses.
"
NickO,5.0,2021 22 November,"
The glass  is well made and excellent value for money. Not the level of a Zalto, but at 1/6th the price, it is still a very good  hand blow glass. One of the glass I received is 117g compares to Zalto Bordeaux glass of the same volume which is 112g. However, the second glass was obviously made by a less skilled artisan and is thicker weighing 148g. I wrote to JBHO and they responded within a couple of hours with a reasonable explanation and offered to replace the glass. I replied with my address and received information in less than 3 hours that one new set of glasses is being sent to me arriving in two days. I was also advised that there is no need to return the less well made glass. I am truly impressed with their customer service and it is perhaps the best I have experienced over the last 16 years of shopping with Amazon. I would highly recommend not only the great value glass which is beautiful. But also the customer service is simple unparalleled!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 15 June,"
These wine glasses are made with quality.  Gave as a gift and my friend absolutely loves them.  They are priced reasonably for the quality of the glass.

Deb H.,5.0,2021 14 March,"
The form of these wine glasses are elegant and beautiful.  They both came in perfect condition. Before using I washed them and handled them gently and with care in the washing, rinsing and towel drying process.  If you handle these (and all) wine glasses gently I assure you they will not break.The shape is very attractive and appealing.  I use these everyday with dinner.  Perfect!
"
Hailey,5.0,2021 15 September,"
These are really nice, classy, and sophisticated wine glasses. I haven't had them that long so I can't speak to durability, but they definitely seem pretty sturdy. I love the way they look and will definitely bring them out when we have guests.
"
Joe Bruner,5.0,2022 27 January,"

"
vegastyphoon,5.0,2022 25 June,"
We filled these puppies with JUSTIN Cabernet which we purchased on Amazon, Unfortunately this Vino is not currently available.Either way, these tall premium wine vessels tend to be very fragile and do tip over easy. We had two bottles of JUSTIN Cab which may explain why these glasses broke. I will be purchasing another set and supervised by someone who'll keep them upright.Overall, these are light beautiful glasses which compliment any Red. Two semi-sober thumbs up !
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2022 24 October,"
I do like these glasses, not in love.  I really thought the diameter of the rim would be larger, like not to put my entire nose in it, but I was expecting it to be larger.  For the price of these two, I am just ok with my purchase but not enough to return, I will keep them on hand.

+or-,5.0,2020 14 August,"
I sent this assortment as a gift and it was very well received.  Because I just learned that some others have received assortments that are not the OREO, CHIPS AHOY! & Nutter Butter Cookie Variety Pack, Family Size, 3 Packs which I ordered, I asked the recipient and have received confirmation that this order was delivered containing the assortment as described.  I personally have not had a Chips Ahoy cookie in many years, but these are the store-bought manufactured cookies that my mother always purchased, so I know them quite well.  Oreos were a favorite of all of my sisters, but I preferred the chips ahoy.  They also liked the icing on cupcakes while I ate the cake.  I ate only the egg yolk and they savored the white of hard-boiled eggs.  I convinced my younger sister to trade her crispy chicken skin for my skinned chicken legs.  I've gotten off track here, sorry.  I sent these cookies as a gift because the recipients love Nutter Butter cookies which I have never tasted.  This assortment was more interesting than sending them a single bag of cookies and since they are a family of five, the cookies will all be enjoyed even if they are in bits and pieces.  They have not yet opened the Chips Ahoy which, according to other reviewers may arrive broken, so I alerted them of that possibility and suggested that they enjoy them in a bowl with milk just as they eat cereal if that's the case with their shipment.  The cookies are well known and top-selling cookies by the Nabisco division of Mondelez International.

Ms Tony T,4.0,2020 13 August,"
Normally I'd prolly be raving about these.  As far as the nutter butter I can they were fantastic. Just about perfect the thing didn't seal shut right no matter what it had a couple spots that just kept coming loose or open a little. So I put them in an airtight bag and they were perfect from there.The Oreos were fairly decent Not stale not expired. Tasted very good, and the package sealed very well Everytime.Unfortunately something was off about the chips ahoy. Not sure if they were expired (my first thought was they didn't get sealed so put them in an airtight bag as well.) Or if it had to do with how they were stored. Or how shipped Just no clue but they were toooo dry with an oddly bitter stale taste that was not in any way good. They weren't horrible but no where near how the should have tasted. Not as fresh as they should have been. Very unimpressed with these.As a note I have purchased these before until this order they were a subscription item for me.. I've gotten them a few times now and this is the first time they have been this bad. Maybe a little stale or dry or..... assumed from shipping conditions rather then something being off or wrong with them.It's was amazing and very dissappointing to experience such a difference from one order to another.Then if you choose to buy it again you have to basically play roulette with whether it's gonna be a good one or one like the last I got. Not a  big fan of hit and miss when it comes to food especially my snack food. Hopefully can find another mix with the nutter butter one of my faves and a couple others I actually like and that show up fresh and delicious. Fingers crossed.

Take 1/2 Cup of water put it in a coffee cup and stick in center of microwave and cook it for 90 seconds 00.90 then open the microwave and then place cookies on microwave safe plate with the 1/2 water full cup in the center of plate and cook for 60 seconds (1 Minute) let cool before touching, eating as contents are hot.

PROS:AMOUNT - over 120 cookies in total.VARIETY - OREOS, CHIPS AHOY AND NUTTER BUTTERS, something for everyone.PRICE - I paid about 13 dollars and I get free Prime delivery, so a good price for me.FRESHNESS - Ones I got were fresh.CON:If there is ONE CON, it's that not as convenient as the snack packs, but there's ALSO more cookies total, so it balances out!

Christine Lesnewsky,5.0,2020 6 September,"
I loved the way that the cookies tasted. The Chips Ahoy Cookies were full of chocolate chips and were soft. They were delicious. The Nutter Butter cookies had peanut butter filling in them and were tasty. My favorite package of cookies were the Oreos, because Oreos are my favorite cookie. They were delicious too. I ate these cookies as a snack, when I went fishing and swimming.

"
C. Benison,4.0,2020 20 June,"

"
Bonnie M. Hartmann,2.0,2020 14 December,"
When I ordered these for my son at college it didn't give me an expiration date.  Needless to say, the expiration date ended up to be about a month after my purchase and my son wasn't able to eat many of them before the expiration so they ended up in the garbage.  I should have just sent him the money to buy them at the local store by him.  Wasted my money for the most part.  :-(
"
Lise,3.0,2020 30 June,"
Cookies were authentic but not as fresh as they are in grocery store. Oreos rarely are whole. I have purchased these 2  or 3 times since I’m avoiding grocery stores, and I noticed the freshness problem each time.

What is bad about cookies???? Let me tell you... chips ahoy and oreo’s were both terribly stale... very dry-in a bad way , with little flavor.. as if they had been in a warehouse for years!! Tasted like sawdust. Went in the garbage fast. As for nutter butter, never tasted them before. So I don’t know what they were supposed to taste like. They went into garbage as well- tasted like thick honey-not peanut butter. I hate to complain , but it seems that packaged goods have been very below par!!!

Smurphette,4.0,2020 9 March,"
I don't have to talk about how good cookies are. Or even how good Nabisco cookies are.  Everyone has a favorite. This three pack of FAMILY sized cookies arrived double boxed and with some packing paper as padding. Probably better packed than the grocery store ones!  They are fresh, with the nearest expiration date three months out and one was four months out. Who keeps a pack of cookies that long?Pricewise, I compared the current Amazon price to my local grocery store; and if you aren't buying them on sale at the store, it's the same price as this three pack. If you get a sale price at the store, it's better there.  But if the convenience of having cookies come to your house while you do other things is worth it to you; you want these.
"
IRG,4.0,2020 19 April,"
These arrived soon after we entered stay-in-place here in NYC. To say that they were quickly opened and eaten is to put it mildly. We needed snacks and there they were. Break out the coffee, the milk, the tea.But we did, seriously, pace ourselves in eating them because they were really good and we could easily have disposed of them by nonstop snacking.My favorite, and that of others, is the classic Oreo. How can you not love an oreo, especially the classic one?Chocolate chips, which are softer than many, are another crowd pleaser here.Although we are all fond of peanut butter, can't say that Nutter Butters were as popular as the other two varieties.We don't generally buy a lot of cookies (we're a savory/chips family) but these really hit the spot.
"
D.D,4.0,2020 22 March,"
It's probably a safe bet you have tried at least one of these cookies.  I actually never had nutter butter, and thought it was quite good.  My kids never had it either.  Chips ahoy and Oreos are classics, and taste  like how I remember them as a kid.My son loves Oreos, and you must eat them with milk.  There is no other way.  My daughter is a cookie fan so she enjoyed the chip a hoys, and we all liked the nutter butter for being our first time.  This was a good variety pack, and come in a box with each of these separately.  We like them.
"
K. Hill,4.0,2020 13 March,"
Chips Ahoy: I haven’t purchased chocolate chip cookies in years. Since I first baked my own from scratch, I’ve preferred my own soft-baked cookies. I wasn’t expecting to like these at all, but the taste of chocolate lingers on the tongue and makes them delicious.Oreo: These are one of my daughter’s favorites. I prefer the vanilla variety, but it’s hard to beat these cookies when you add them to vanilla ice cream.Nutter Butter: They’re cute and tasty. My husband loves peanut butter so he’s a big fan of these. This was my daughter’s first time trying them and she liked them as well.4 STARS: Be forewarned, cookies are addictive. My family is really enjoying this variety pack.
"
William,4.0,2020 24 December,"

"
Lori Caswell/Dollycas,4.0,2020 26 March,"
We never have enough cookies in the house and since this package included three of our favorites this was a must buy. 1 CHIPS AHOY! Original, 1 OREO Original, 1 Nutter ButterI do wish the Oreos had been Double Stuffed :)My only complaint is that the Chips AHOY! did not travel will. When we opened the package there were a lot of broken cookies, but broken did not affect the taste at all.The cookies were enjoyed by our whole family!
"
roxycowgirl,5.0,2020 13 March,"
Family favorites slightly cheaper than the grocery store delivered to my front door.  What could be better?  This is the ultimate cookie trifecta and is by far the top three cookie choices for our family so it is nice to be able to order all three with one click.  I like that it is the larger family packs.  I use these to put in my kids lunches.  I used to get the prepackaged ones, but felt like 6 was too many and the only ones that have two are the Oreos.  I think three is the perfect number.  My kids like to get one of each kind!  The kids are always excited to find cookies in their lunches.It is a nice convenient way to get cookies.  They arrived without being damaged was my only real concern.  I will be buying these again.
"
Bravewarrior,4.0,2020 15 March,"
The Oreos and Chips Ahoy are my favorites.  There's a lot of cookies. They are crisp and fresh and yummy.The peanut butter ones are too sweet.  My son isn't too crazy about them either.There is no price listed, but I wouldn't pay more than $3.50 for each extra large pack.  They showed up in a large box with no broken cookies.
"
R. Sutton,4.0,2020 13 March,"
Oreo & Chips Ahoy...... Great!  No issuesNutter Butter:  I still like  get peanut butter.  These cookies are a satisfying way to get my peanut butter but far from real peanut  butter  taste.  The outer cookie is solid, so don't see broken cookies in the package.Only down side, can't re-seal the package.  Once I open this one, I have to find a big zip lock bag.
"
Wired Rabbit,5.0,2020 10 March,"
Who doesn't love Oreos?  And I have to admit, I do enjoy Nutter Butter cookies with milk or coffee.  Chips Ahoy are the classic chocolate chips-filled cookies that are very satisfying.  All three came in a very secure box, well wrapped and not one cookie was even broken a bit. I was amazed.  The size of the packages, a pound or more each, means that for the price, you are getting a whole lot of cookies.  For price comparison, Safeway sale price for Oreo 8 Oz packs is around 2.50.  These packages have a pound or more for a bit over four dollars. So this is a deal. A great way to get a bunch of cookies all will love, for parties and good times!
"
R. A. Barricklow(Scaramouche),5.0,2020 28 March,"
Who could resist this supreme tasty trio from Nabisco?Headlining the trio is the cookie icon, Oreo; even becoming part of the lingo in describing ideologies in certain circumstances. My favorite of this line-up.Used in ice-cream toppings and a favorite of many since childhood.Next in line, is Nutter Butter, my wife's & son's favorite. A sort of Goldilocks; just right in crunch(not too hard, not too soft; in taste(not too sweet & sugary, not too bland); and the size is just right as well.And then the anchor in the lineup: Chips Ahoy. Unfortunately, these ended up being a little to hard and crumbly. Not was we were used to from this name brand, well known product.All in all, a stellar cookie lineup of all star taste & satisfaction![minus the chips]
"
Natasha Galbreath,4.0,2020 9 March,"
A good value for the cookies we all know and love. Nothing new about them its the same recipe as always. It comes with family sized packages of traditional Oreo, Nutter Butter and original Chips Ahoy. If your family are fans of these products, this wont disappoint!
"
JLES,5.0,2020 19 March,"
What's not to love about this variety pack? Oreos, Chips Ahoy and Nutter Butter cookies are all favorites in this family of younger children and the parents. I think my spouse could sit down an eat an entire package at one time. These were all fresh, delish and in perfect condition with no damage. I can't even bring these home from the grocery without some breaking. My favorite is the Nutter Butters and I olny have to fight the spouse for these as the kids are too busy licking the middle out of the oreos.
"
Annette,5.0,2020 13 March,"
Just like in the store, these cookies look the same and taste the same - yummy and great. This is a really good family value variety pack of cookies with the Chips Ahoy cookies, Nutter Butters and Oreos together. This offers three good different options of cookies for everyone to choose and have variety. It's good having these choices together because some like lots of chocolate, others like less chocolate and others don't like any chocolate - it works great for me and my family's preferences with our differences of what we prefer.If you want some yummy cookies, some variety, and good size cookie packages for you and your family or friends then you'll love these.
"
Bill A. Belt,5.0,2020 19 March,"
This is 3 FAMILY SIZE packages of cookie snacks from Nabisco.  Oreo's, Chips Ahoy's and Nutter Butter's.  The Oreo package is 1 lb 3.1 oz.  The Chips Ahoy are 1 lb 2.2 oz.  The Nutter Butter are 16 oz.  The packages are family size.  All 3 packages had good best buy dates but these cookies will not last that long.  We will have eaten all of them.  We have already opened the Chips Ahoy's and the Oreo's.  Both are delicious.  You can not go wrong buying this 3 pack.  Yummy cookies.
"
Eric L.,4.0,2020 11 March,"
Three delicious cookies in on shipment! If you’ve had these cookies, you know what to expect. Cookies arrived I damaged and fresh.
"
Patricia,5.0,2020 16 March,"
These came while my grown son was visiting, and we pretty much ran through the Oreos that night, and the Chips Ahoy the next day. About half of the Nutter Butters are still in the package- not our favorite, though they are tasty.  I thought the cream filling was skimpy in the Oreos, and even checked the package to see if it was a different version- lower calorie or fat, etc. The Chips Ahoy were very crumbly, but good. These didn't last long enough to be eaten with ice cream, but they are good for that or simply dunking in milk. Simple goodness.
"
Phoenix,5.0,2020 8 March,"
I have children rnaging from K through college. Cookies are an absolute must in this house if I don't want to hear complaining that thie'rs nothing ""sweet to eat in the entire house."" This is a great buy. Three of everyone's favoriate flavors and enough to go around so no one is fighting over who gets to open a package and get first dibs. Definitely a pantry staple and a good value as well.
"
Nuk,4.0,2020 11 March,"
Everything a classic.  You can not go wrong with this bundle.  It is a trio of deliciousness.  Of course, you have to slow down and watch the sugar, which is hard to resist.

What can you say about Nabisco, except everything is delicious.Family favorites are now available at Amazon. Same packaging, same taste, but better prices!  Comes just as fresh as ever!This set includes three of our family size favorites: Chips Ahoy!, Oreo, and Nutter Butter!Perfect for any occasion or better yet, just treat yourself!
"
Total Boy Mom,5.0,2020 14 March,"
You absolutely cannot go wrong with this cookie flavor combo.  The box arrived well packaged and all of my cookies were in perfect condition.  The sell by date seemed a little short to me (May 2020) but it could have just been the package that I received.  The cookies were all very fresh and delicious, exactly what I would expect from these brands.  Very pleased!
"
Johnny,5.0,2020 4 March,"
Sweet teeth unite. This has the be the all time classic collection, right! The packages all arrived double boxed. PHEW!!! I was afraid I might be getting cookie crumbs. These are truly the Nabisco classics. Which is your fave???
"
Honest Reviewer,5.0,2020 20 March,"
What a great combo!  Something for everyone in this package deal. My favorite are the Nutter Butters. They are so amazing, and addictive. I don’t know how anyone could say no. The Oreos were amazing. I am not a huge fan of Chips Ahoy, but the husband loves them.  Win, win!!  I do wish the Nutter Butter pack had a reseal package.

Everyone knows these are delicious. I don't even know what to say if you've never had an Oreo or a Chips Ahoy.  I'm not a huge fan of Nutter Butters. but other people in my family are.  These are full-sized packages. It's a great variety and a decent price.

This assortment was a hit at our house. We usually get individual snack size for our kids and so they were excited to have the normal sized options. The packages arrived with a some of the cookies broken but that is an amazon packaging problem.

I ordered this package for a nephew in college and what he got was Oreos, Graham Crackers and Ritz Crackers. He didn't know it was wrong because I didn't tell him what to expect. But when he thanked me for the crackers I knew something was wrong with the order. Supposedly they have reshipped him the right order. I will find out when it arrives today.

I rely heavily on the reviews of other customers and their experiences and sometimes I even go straight to the reviews before I even look at the vendor's description and full listing / photos of their product.  SO...... I was sort of wary purchasing cookies from this vendor because of many reports of stale, smashed cookies, and expired best by dates. But I decided to take a chance.All the cookies were purchased on 10/16/21 and delivered on 10/18/21 PRIME delivery within 2 days THANK YOU very much Amazon.Am glad to say almost everything was fine with my cookies - no crumbs, no breaks with the NUTTER BUTTERS and OREOS, and quality of those cookies were excellent even though the OREOS were within 1 month of their expiration date.EXCEPT for the CHIPS AHOY, they were mostly broken and had a stale funny aftertaste yet they were still 3 months within their expiration date.***NUTTER BUTTER***Expiration date 24 FEB 22NO PROBLEM-NUTTER BUTTERS***OREOS***Expiration date 27 NOV 2021NO PROBLEM-OREOS***CHIPS AHOY***Expiration date 24 JAN 22PROBLEMS- BREAKS, LARGE CRUMS,STALE TASTING, SLIGHTLY STRANGE AFTER TASTE. (See all 6 photos)So the question is are the CHIPS AHOY still edible?  Well, I really don't have a big problem with breaks and crumbs and I never met a cookie I didn't like unless there was green mold and things crawling around. And I even sometimes enjoy stale cookies with a glass of milk. So my real issue is with the funny after taste and I'm hoping after the Chips Ahoy air out some, the aftertaste will dissipate.Would I order these from this vendor again, maybe.... maybe not.

First, I want to say that I am not a professional installer nor do I always DIY things so this was a process for me and I was making a lot of notes along the way.Overall, I love the LEDs, they are bright, with what looks like accurate colors and the multiple modes is awesome.  I find the app control quite responsive, with only 1 complaint.  Once you enter the controller for the LEDs there is no way to turn them on/off.  You have to back out to the connection menu and hit the slider next to the connected controller.  Being able to remotely control the lights is great and limited extraneous wiring needs.Product ArrivalProduct arrived well packaged and on time.  I know it is shipped by Amazon, but it is always nice to get it right when I expect it.  The use of anti static bags for the pieces inside was a nice touch.  I have ordered multiple inexpensive RGB options for the house/car and these were the first ones that had everything in the box bagged up.  Second piece of the packaging was the imagery on the box.  While a little embellished, it was nice to see the box come with some representation of what this would look like on a car.  It is an extra touch that usually is a brown box with no image and a sticker on it.InstallationI appreciate the desire to have everything come out of the box connected, but I am not sure how many people will be able to fully install it without unscrewing the strips from one another and having to mount them separately.  This action in and of itself is not a pain, but once you unscrew them the O-Rings used to prevent water from getting into the connections can come off.  I dropped two in the process of unscrewing and pulling apart the 6 connection points for the system.  They are small and rather difficult to find once dropped.  My daughter and I searched for about 10 minutes to find the two.  If the system came disassembled, meaning none of the strips connected, it may prevent this from happening, plus it enables an easier placement of LED strips and tying off of extra wire.  If I were KORJO I would survey purchasers and ask how many of you disconnected the strips before installation, if 80%+ did, then ship it disconnected.  May seem like a nit-pick, but any little frustration can turn into a big frustration through different chain of events.The 3M tape on the back of the strips do not seem to like being exposed to air too long before adhering to the surface it is going to be attached too.  I learned on the rear strips that by pulling the entirety of the backing off before starting to stick it to the surface I wanted it on, and it fell off.  3M VHB tape is an extremely good tape and the surface was plastic which I have used the tape on before and it was clean.  I am making an assumption on why it wouldn't adhere.  The VHB tape could be thicker a bit.  I know this makes it harder to hide under the sides and front of the car, but at the same time it allows for more little scratches or changes in the surface of placement.  I noticed that in sticking on the long strips on the sides of the car, the extra length has a tendency to pull on the already stuck portion as you are working your way down the strip as well.  Just something to keep in mind.The little plastic anchors are clear which allows the light through, but that allows means they glow as the light passes through them.  On my front strips you cannot see the strips but you can definitely notice the anchors.  I am not sure there is a fix for this, just make sure that when using the anchors you get them out or site as well.Waterproof AbilitiesThis system has now been through 5 car washes and a total of 82 miles of driving when it is raining.  I have not had a single failure yet. (Knock on wood)  They seem to be holding up well.  I will admit that the seals with some extra hot glue in them are a little concerning when you first look at them but they have been holding up well.  As I live in Chicago, I look forward to what happens as snow starts falling and how they will deal with the temperatures.  I also detail the car with a steam cleaner in the garage with high pressure steam making its way over these strips as I clean the different areas of the car and still no moisture intrusion.  I have been actively watching this based on other reviews.  I will update if something happens.Lighting PerformanceThey are definitely brighter than I thought, I can run them in the afternoon as the sun starts going down and see them quite clearly in daylight.  They look amazing at night and the different modes are really key to this.  Using one of the red, white, and green ones right now for the holiday season.  I wish there was a way to create customer motion modes, but I cannot find it in the app at this point.  I realize that is more of an app issue, but keep in mind that the entire experience of this product is from purchase through use to support, so this is important.  Other than that the system is responsive and easy to connect to, the searching for BT devices in the app is a bit awkward as it finds my tv, my watch, and a whole bunch of other non-LED things that I need to scroll through to get to the controller, but it is a minor issue as well.I love the LEDs, they look good, they perform, and so far are much better than I expected.

Chris E.,4.0,2022 20 October,"
Customer Service took care of me. They sent me another strip and it actually works this time. I'm skeptical but can't complain except for the lost time on the original install. They at least made it right and the lights do look really good. Only complaint now is the the app is a little funky but once you figure it out it seems to be reliable. Thanks for the customer service.Original - I bought this kit, installed it, honestly looks great. Then thought, huh, why is the back not changing colors. Literally half the lights are unresponsive to color change in the app. They stay white all the time. So disappointed I spent all that time on a clean install and now I have to rip it all out to return it. DONT BUY UNLESS YOU LIKE REDOING YOUR WORK.

Actanonverba,5.0,2022 16 October,"
Ok. So I'm like most of the people that did a review. I bought two sets of lights one for my truck and one for my wife's jeep. Well with work and all I tested both sets of lights they both came on didn't think to check the functionality of them to excited to do so. So one weekend I put hers in not to bad on setup for Jeep Grand Cherokee loved the ways hers looked. So I waited till the following week to put it on my truck got them all situated and we'll wouldn't you know it one side of my trucks didn't work I emailed the Korjo team told them what happened within 4-5 days I had a new set they sent out and now it's all good.

Update as of 10/18/2022**I got a message from the seller and was helped by Emma. She was amazing! She helped resolve my issue and was very kind and helpful, I really was not expecting this today and she really made my day. I would recommend this seller for this product because they stand by the product and will help you get the issue resolved quick and easy!5 stars! -Danny MolinaThe first couple of weeks with this I was so impressed. But after a few weeks the lights would start to dim little by little until it’s barely even visible at night. Maybe I got a defective product but for the amount paid I would’ve hoped this lasted at least a year.

Gerrad,4.0,2022 14 October,"
So I ordered a kit and sadly one of the led strips did not work, I reached out to the seller who sent me a new one however it never arrived Emma then sent me another strip which arrived and is working great! Highly recommend! The adhesive is not the best it will stick but for someone like me who gets snow I’m sure it won’t last long so I decided to grab some gorilla glue and place little dabs along the strip for extra strength. They are decent for brightness I’ll definitely be getting more soon for my buddy’s
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 16 October,"
I installed the kit and it worked great. Was bright and nice but after a week one side stopped working. I bought 2 sets for 2 cars so going to replace the current one with that one and return the one I have on. But before I sent it out I was contacted by the seller. Emma was very nice and was sending me a replacement strip instead. That was great because it took me a good while to set up the lights. And did not want to have to take it all down for one strip. Lights are very bright compared to others I have tried. Thanks Emma
"
Djlythium,4.0,2022 13 January,"
This is a pretty quality kit, though it has some quicks that seems like somewhat important oversights.- First, the Bluetooth module is only about 2’ from one of the pairs of 24” lights, which makes mounting it in a position away from heat/moisture pretty difficult, whether it’s mounted in the front of the vehicle or the rear. Simply, not having enough cable length to mount the module anywhere inside the cabin (or even around the engine bay) puts the module at risk of heat / moisture damage. Hopefully, those modules are weatherproof (they seem like it, but we’ll see).- Second, the included brackets and screws seem chosen for the kit almost haphazardly. The tiny screws work *only for screwing into plastic*; they will snap during any attempt to screw into metal. The brackets themselves had a small, but important, IMO, issue that no one has seemed to mention: the brackets only fully secure the LED strips at the ends of the strips themselves. I'll try to explain: the depth of the brackets is about 3/8"", which matched the thickness of the ends of the strips (where the power wires connect), but is too large for the rest of the strip, which is only about 1/4"" thick. So, when using the brackets across the LED strip range, there was about a 1/8"" gap between the bracket and the strip, which means that the bracket isn't really securing the strip, but rather acting as a sort of 'safety' to prevent the strip from falling completely off the vehicle should the adhesive fail. IMO, this is a huge oversight, and one I was not about the let linger. My fix was to use a small piece of that clear VHB tape I used for the front strips here, trifolded to fit into the space within the brackets. Then, because of how I mounted the LED strips down the sides, and in the rear, I snipped off one end to make them C-mount brackets. After mounting them with tiny self-tapping screws into metal, they worked out well! The tape eliminated the 1/8"" gap, and everything mounted solidly.- Third, the app is great, for the most part, but a small gripe I have if that you have to reconnect it to the lights after every power cycle. The Bluetooth loses connection, which makes sense, though it’d be nice if it tried to automatically reconnect whenever the app was opened. Just a suggestion.- Lastly, and this goes for any kind of adhesive prep, *ensure you thoroughly clean the mounting surface!* I used a towel soaked with rubbing alcohol & windex (to dilute) to clean all surfaces, twice, to ensure bonding, and it seemed to work thus far. I think the LED strips are backed with 3M VHB tape, which works well when bonding to a surface free from all dirt, grease, and grime. Take time to prep the surface well, and you should be GtG. I’ll try to report back with long-term updates of the adhesion.Now, despite my findings / concerns, I’m very happy with the setup! I looked for a legit kit for a looooong time, and this one, overall, is fantastic! The light response is instant, there are many colors, the lights are bright even in the daytime, and there are a TON of patterns!

Brandon,5.0,2022 13 October,"
The lights are bright, and they look amazing. I had an issue with one of my sides, and it was replaced by support. I didn't trust the adhesion so I used the hangers. When pulling the broken side off though the adhesive was strong enough to hold on and rip the already broken strips. The app works well though I wish it would auto connect. I also wish that it was a bit more friendly as for things like favorite patterns etc.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 26 September,"
Love the way the lights look and the ease of the app via my phone. Since in my town flashing underglow is considered illegal I usually just ride with the solid non emergency color and up to this point its been a non-issue with law inforcement. I did how ever have 2 lights go completely solid white and would not react with the app and would stay on even after power was turned off, a quick email to customer service who responded really fast and they sent me a replacement set of neons that arrived the next day. If your on the fence about buying trust me you will love the way your car looks.

 Pros: Adhesive works really well, but make sure to use the brackets to be on the safe side.Install is not bad at all, from an electrical standpoint make sure you do not just wire the lights directly to the battery, either use the supplied connector or wire it using a rocker switch with an inline fuse.Overall it looks really good for the price... it doesn't look as good as lowglow but for the price I am very happy with it.Cons: I did have an issue with one of my strips after installing it. It would only remain white and would not change colors. It also would not turn off with the app, but luckily since I wired it with a rocker switch I was still able to turn it off.I contacted customer service (swomall@foxmail.com, not the email that comes on the box) and they were super helpful and provided me with a replacement strip within a few days. the only down side was having to uninstall the faulty strip and install the new strip.

Thomas ,3.0,2022 12 July,"
Cool looks, drains battery if you plug into something always on like a horn. Plug into something that requires the car to turn on like the fog lights. Sucks u cant turn on from outside w/o vehicle on but will save you some time from jump starting the car. I plugged mine into the horn cause my fog light was already in use by the inter glow lights. Which could also be why car died. Who knows. I did have to get a replacement. While installing some turned them on to make sure i had lights positioned correctly. Only front half worked cause in the led where u cut it, it separated without cutting through the waterproofing cover which was a bummer. The only other thing is there are two strips which u have to route starting with power source and pull everything through a path that doesnt go near moving parts. Would like to see a model with disconnect locations in the wiring so if i need to replace one i can. Since i only pulled out the bad strip I technically used lights from two different sets and there was a length difference and a slight color differ When compared next to each other though i ordered the exact replacement so dont cross kit if ones messed up and test before u find your routing path as well. App isnt too bad. It communicates with the lights well unlike my inter glow which is different company from 2017. Lots of preselected modes. U cant customize the flashes but its got a bunch and just increase til u see a pattern u like. U can pick and choose solid colors and save presets which is nice. Not bad. Would consider this to b a mid quality product simply because my brand new battery that was replaced 3 months ago died a week after install. Instructions do say for fog light but rebel life. This leads me to believe that that bluetooth control box takes up ridiculous amounts of power but like i said i have two set ups that are technically always on so i cant say for sure. Who knows maybe i got a short elsewhere, i did have to replace it but thats normal for a 5 yr old battery. Excluding battery issues for the price its totally worth it and gives your car that extra umpf in appearance it was missing. I enjoy and run them every time i drive at night and have no reason for them in the day which is why i was surprised my car was dead. Cant say for sure it was the lights that killed it. Aside from battery 4 stars

nik c,4.0,2022 14 August,"
This kit was about a 4hr install by myself on my truck. The screws and plastic brackets were very cheap and break easy. I had to drill holes before I put the screws in because the screw heads just twist right off (cheap) running all the wiring is time consuming. The 2 sided tape would not stick to anything (cheap) once I got done I was very impressed with how bright they are and all the different modes. The Bluetooth app was pretty straight forward. For the price I would recommend.
"
Ozzy,4.0,2022 24 July,"
Pros: This underglow is seriously great! I had Govee lights before these and I thought they were good but they weren’t waterproof so they kept dying. These, however, have withstood the Florida summer thus far and I am very impressed. It’s nice and vibrant, the adhesive is good, not great, and it seems really reliable.Cons: The app feels like it’s absolute bare minimum effort. It’s annoying having to “reconnect” manually every time, and going through 120 tick marks is a little time consuming needless to say. The app needs a lot of work but it’s sad to say they’ll probably leave it that way. If you don’t mind the inconvenience of bad user interface, then no big deal.All in all, real solid product!

So this kit is crazy bright! For the price it is very bright.  Only down side is the app to work it doesn't have a off feature. You have to slide the brightness setting all the way to the left. There isn't an actual ""off"" feature.  Besides that everything is great.

Amazon Customer,3.0,2022 7 October,"
So the light install itself was fine. Was a bit of a pain to get the cables to my battery/fuse box, but that’s due to the shape of everything going on in my engine bay.I chose to add a fuse into my fog light switch, and ran the negative to the battery. (The way it recommends in the instructions.) Three days later my car was dead, and I had to have my husband give me a jump so I could get to work.I suppose I could have gone the route of using the 12v, but I really didn’t wanna have to mess my going through my firewall. It also would have looked messy imo.The app works fine for me, the lights themselves also worked just fine for me. Just wish I didn’t have to pop my hood and plug them in before I used them/ remember to unplug them every time. Overall, you get what you pay for. I’ll upgrade eventually. 🤷🏼‍♀️

Chamber,5.0,2022 16 August,"
im a night person, soon as it gets dark i hop in my car ill be out all night. now that i installed these underbody lights i never wanna go home. i usually use the green color to match the color of my car but when i wanna really show off ill use the multi colors. easy to install, i bought these a few months ago so im doing a later review. the switch to turn the lights on went bad after a few months so i suggest you go to auto zone or advanced auto and buy a strong toggle switch. and the app is easy to use took me a few tries to figure it out but in the end it works perfect.

Isaiah zeek,4.0,2022 12 June,"
So far these are good, I've ordered these a lot. They were so much better when every light was individual now it's all one piece and if one strip falls off somewhere when your out and about you cant take it off or do anything, it'll just get destroyed and then have to buy  WHOLE new set. However everything is good, just the box came damaged with like a knuckle like indention. I hooked the lights up and one half side of 2 strips continues to stay on even when turned off and will not change colors but the rest of can will change.Sending these back for a refund and get another pair. We will see how it goes

 So, I bought this little KORJO kit on a whim. It was on sale and I wanted to do something fancy cosmetic to my Toyota MR2 Spyder. The installation was quite easy. The adhesive was just strong enough to hold the strips in place long enough to set some self tapping screws into the body of the car. I am glad that the kit came with hardware (in theory) but you are much better off going to the hardware store and buying your own self tapping screws. I was very impressed by the brightness and vividness of the colors that the LED produced. Compared to some other generic kits I've used in the past, the KORJO is plenty bright for the cost. The major downside is that there is no way to customize the settings more than just editing a solid color to bookmark. That said though the 100+ tracking options get the job done for a simple kit. I was more concerned about how good they would be illuminating my engine bay, which is the primary reason I wanted LEDs in the first place. They do wonders in that regard. Because they are in the hottest part of the car, I have no idea what the longevity of the Korjo's will be. But until they fail I'd say I am a happy customer.

 This product was really great. I love everything about the setting and what you are able to do with them off of the app. I had bought the lights in July and was not able to install them until probably around October or so. One of the strips went out on my driver side around the end of March 2022 which took the current from the front all the way to the back and cut it completely. I was so worried I was going to have to scrap the whole thing and get a new set but after reaching out to the seller, they agreed to send me a replacement set which worked just as great. I get nothing but complements on the lights as I have a strong friend group and even strangers will complement them. They are super bright and I cannot be missed going down the road. The adhesion does stick really well, especially if you clean it with alcohol very thoroughly to ensure you get a nice clean surface. There are a few reviews on here that talk about adhesion being crap, which could had been true but nothing a little bit of extra 3m that won't do the trick to fix it. the original adhesion has stuck in the entirety of it being on in all weather conditions, snow, rain, road salt, and now facing heat. Overall I would recommend this product, and for the price, you really cannot beat it.

 I like everything about these underglows. My car looks so sweet. I added a set to my girl's car she's in love! Now I'ma see if my dad will let me put some on the truck!! I can't wait for it to snow gonna look so cool I bet. So bright and vivid. I went into the grocery store and left my lights on auto. And walked out to people taking videos of the light show. Very unique. Well worth the price!!

Literally the best lights and customer service for the lights on the market. They are so bright they can be seen in the day and I found them super easy to install. I get compliments all the time and I have recommended these exact ones to all my boys. Ps- Emma at customer service is the best!!

 I’ve bought multiple sets of these and have no complaintsCheaper than man options out there and better qualityDoes NOT connect to music on light up but have over 100 settingsIf you have any fall off and get ruined it’s still a lot cheaper to buy a new kit than a “low glow kit “ for 300$ +

I bought this kit for my son in August 2021. Unfortunately it sat in a box until May 2022 because we didn’t know how to install it. But he finally got some help from a friend who had tools and knew a bit about installing underglow. The lights looked great except for the left side, and the left back. For some reason they didn’t work at all. Fortunately we had the box and paperwork and emailed the customer service email as advised. Honestly I didn’t expect much since it had been almost a year, but I quickly heard back from Emma who very kindly offered to send us a replacement for the faulty lights. She said the color might not match exactly, but they looks great! My son is thrilled! We would definitely buy these again! I really appreciate the good communication and excellent customer service.

 I would give these 5 stars if the controls and cords would have been better. The installation was fairly easy. I installed these on my Tracker 195 TXW boat. I used the 1st short strip on each side inside the long forward compartments then continued down the inner railing towards the back of the boat. The biggest problem was the length of cable from controller to the connection. I had to buy an extension from another brand that fits but not very well. The cable could not be screwed together to be sealed. I tried looking for extensions made by same manufacturer and could not find them. So ended up spending an additional 20 dollars on top of this purchase. The other brand plugged in but I cannot screw the collar together to secure the connection. I am using heat shrink around it to keep it plugged in. I'm not sure how the adhesive is going to hold up. I cleaned and prepped all surfaces with alcohol before adhesion but still had to add a dab of superglue to one that would not stick and the adhesive was already coming off led strip.Controls are little awkward for this price range. I would expect a stand alone controller not an app. You will need to either wire them to a switched circuit or add a switch to turn these off when desired. The app then allows you to change colors or patterns.Overall up to this point I am happy with the outcome but these leave a little to be desired at this price range. Longer cables needed between controller and first strip, better control or switch should be included. Wish I had spent just a little more time searching and found a kit with all of these options.

Ordered these lights for my wife’s car. They arrived quickly and we’re very easy to install. We did have a minor problem with one of the strips which was corrected quickly with a quick message to the seller. They sent a replacement strip right away and it worked great. This is our second set of lights that we purchased from the seller and both times it has been a wonderful experience.Thanks again and I’m sure we’ll purchase more from you

 These lights are really bright, honestly way brighter than cheap AutoZone/Walmart lights etc. My main reason for purchase was the size,the majority of other underglows are always 48"" (4ft) for the rocker panels (side skirts) which I HATE,it makes the lights look cheap and unprofessional bc most rockers are closer to 6ft ish,plus it has two front and two back strips that are so long I had to overlap them in the back (which is a good thing to me) the front and back strips (mind you two each) are longer than most side strips in other kits. Huge plus++They come with all the hardware you need,brackets,screws,great adhesive (3M),zip ties and most importantly...screw in plugs to connect/disconnect the wires to make installation easier...and they are high quality connectors...not some cheap plug in that will fall out.They were easy enough to install,and are very very bright in comparison to other lights I've seen and delt with,they hang with the best of them I promise.The control is simple,the functions and app all work great but I wish it was sound activated,but for me everything has been seemless functionality wise...just wish it had a bit more options,it has alot...trust me but I like alot...more lol*****The app (for reference to people who want to know what they are buying before hand) is ""LED Hue"",and it uses Bluetooth but you must have your location on to connect,alot of people have this issue so I figured I'd help a bit. & Furthermore,I stay connected to my stereo while I use the lights through Bluetooth to both the stereo and light system without issue,so you don't have to disconnect one to use the other thankfully*****Pro's-Bright (like...really bright)-Easy to install-Easy to connect & control (big win for me personally over most light kits)-High Quality housing/ wires/ adhesive/ controller/ connectors.-Beautiful effectsCan't find any cons personally,it was all pretty straight forward.Note.I only wish my camera could catch the dynamics of the color transitions and brightness/saturation of the lights.Look no further for quality underglows/L.E.D. lights

As another reviewer mentioned this light kit used to come in multiple strips that you would link together.This way if you had the lights attached to your bumper and a mechanic needed to take your bumper off they could quickly and simply dissconect the plugs on the front strip.Now these LED strips seem to come in one long strand. I do not like this. No I'm going to have to remove the light strip off of the bumper, let it dangle while i work on my car and then reattach it.What if i damage a strip? It would be so easy to dissconnect one and replace it. Not this, your going to have undo your whole project when it dies.As a computer science graduate I feel the app is really lacking.Besides having a scroll wheel to scroll through the 200 lighting options. How about a tab, SOLID COLOR, Twinkle, PULSE etc.  After that is choosen you should then have the 2nd option to select what colors you want to PULSE or chase each other. Not just a single color or the random colors that they have programmed.I'm currently on a road trip and will post photos and videos at 10,000 miles.The filter should be dry, or just slightly damp before re-installing.The sticky backing is nice to help layout the lights while installing, but I wouldn't rely on it to keep the lights up.

Let me first start off by saying I only write reviews if I REALLY like or dislike something. I have written 5 reviews in my 34 years of life. The product itself is a great idea, and would be amazing if it functioned. The right side works, but on the left side only the front strip works partially, then the side and rear left don't work at all. I have attached a picture of the left front strip where it becomes dysfunctional. The golden part on the left side of the strip works correctly, then the red part only emits either red or no color, then after that no color. I contact the seller not once, or even twice, but THREE times with no response back. I also tried to look up a contact number, email, or ANYTHING; but there isn't any. I was hoping that they could either troubleshoot me or send me a replacement. My only choice at this point is to have them uninstalled and return them. If the seller ends up contacting me by some miracle, I will update you guys.UPDATE: I want to update everyone. The seller DID respond to me in a timely manner, the emails were just going to a different email than I was checking. This was totally my fault! So I did have a little trouble with the lights, but the seller has been so amazing and is sending me a replacement! I get it, there are going to be problems with products occasionally, but how a seller handles those issues says EVERYTHING! I am going to change my rating, because honestly the product is amazing, and the customer service just hit 5-stars as well. Thank you Swomall :)

Ben,5.0,2021 25 November,"
Bought my lights in July of 2021 they worked up until recently due to a controller malfunction. TO BE NOTED this was due to heavy HEAVY use, by heavy use I mean 2-3 hours a day for weeks at a time. I reached out to their customer service thinking this was going to be another one of those red herrings where nothing would get done.Boy was I wrongI contacted the customer service, Emma (Their customer service rep) responded within 24 hours jumping straight into troubleshooting. After all the troubleshooting was completed (Unfortunately not solving the issue), they finished by offering to send me a brand-new set of lights to replace my old set! Better yet, I did not even have to go through the hassle of sending the old ones back! Overall wonderful experience, Emma was cordial, polite, respectful, and timely in every response.For those saying the lights drain your battery, that’s user error. These are not meant to be hardwired directly to the battery, they are meant to be on some sort of switch that directly shuts power off to the lights. PROS• Sick Lights• 3M Adhesive Tape Mounting• Rubber Screw-on Bracket Mounting• 12v Cigarette Lighter Adapter• Very Long Wiring Harness• Screw In Watertight connections• Great Customer Service• 6 Month Warranty• Very Long LED StripsCONS• Screw-on brackets can be yanked off screws

Amazon Customer,3.0,2021 13 October,"
The kit worked great before install. Ran power using the lighter switch. Checked lights again after all that wire was hidden, worked great, surprisingly because the power wires are 22 gauge or smaller. Completely installed the kit, turned it on, and it worked...for 30 secs. Now it only flicker when the power cord going into each set of lights is moved or messed with, indicating a short. Grabbed a meter to check power coming out of the control box/Bluetooth transmitter, yep, good power and my phone connects to the device. Definitely a short in the first power cords at the beginning of each 3 strand side, which makes the whole thing not work. I knew it was gonna be 50/50 after i saw how small the power wires were.Edit:Amazon sent a new kit, installed being even more careful than before. Its been one week, so far so good. I'm using the outlet switch currently until i find a switch i like or wire straight to fog light fuse. Bumped review up to 3 stars because although it looks and performs good, the wires on both sets are very small gauge and brittle (you'll see when you strip the 1/32"", also, really, soldered exposed wire away for a better connection) , the little rubber hangers are absolutely junk (go buy real wire clamps), and the app isnt the best. The app isnt a big deal because I just leave it on a solid color and change it very rarely. I also dont have that heart feature in my app to save favorite color mixes. It is nice the connectors for the lights are well built and seal with a O ring. 3m tape is as expected. Clean the surface with isopropyl and it should stick for a long time. Remember to mock it up, then remove tape backer. Once its pulled off after pressed on, it might stick again but not with the same bond.

If you are looking for An Underglow Kit to install on Your Vehicle look no further. I have installed this exact kit on 50+ Jeeps over the past year and have NEVER had an Issue with Any part of it. For that Reason I continue to Click ""Buy Again"" 😂😂😂The Bluetooth App works Flawlessly and Easy to Connect. Once Connected to the App you can Switch the lights On or Off, Change Colors, Create Your Own Color or Choose Between 120 Different Chase Patterns. What Else do you Want! Lol.The Double Sided tape on the LED Strips Is Strong! Be sure to clean all Surfaces before Sticking the lights to the vehicle.  91% ( Alcohol) works Perfectly. Not sure what else to say but I love a Product that works and is Extremely Reliable. Hope this Review Helps!

Looked great.  The app took a little getting used to.  Install was easy enough with the sticky tape and the mount brackets.  Although the tiny screws that came with the kit took a little coaxing to drive into automotive plastic.  Largest drawback, it stopped working after four months.  I know the device is getting power because the Bluetooth still responds.  Just can't get the lights to come on.Edit: I'm in communication with the company and they're helping resolve the issue by sending a new controller.  I will edit again if it gets fixed.Edit: Company sent me a new controller free of charge. Installed today and works great again. The faulty part was a 5 min fix.  So glad I didn't have to replace it all.

 I like this product it’s cool it works good but my whole entire left side of the car lights work perfect but on the other side of the car the middle in the back lights don’t turn on but in the front they’re all on so if there’s anyway to get a replacement for one entire side that would be helpful.

 I have had these installed now for 2 months which I know isn't a long term review. With that being said, I have been on multiple road trips from SC to PA and SC to FL. I have driven in rain with them more times than I can count, and have used automatic carwashes several times. I have had zero issues so far with any of the strips malfunctioning. The app is decent and shows what solid color you are using. It does not tell you which one of the patterns you are using though, which would be a very helpful feature to have. I actually never turn them off because I normally forget and they shut off when I shut the car off anyway. So that means they are on every time I drive the car day or night and still work perfectly.  I have received tons of compliments. Very solid product.

Denzel J Poole,4.0,2021 16 July,"
Kit is pretty good.Pros: very bright, app works well, diffrent options out of the box for a hard wire install or a cigarette lighter plug in, app is a on and off switch or you can plug it in the cigarette lighter and use the on and off switch there, lots of diffrent modes, color slider for unlimited color choices, wires were very long and reached every side of my srt4 no problem, double sided tape sticks pretty good.Cons. After less than a week the tape isn't sticking at the corners of 2 of the lights but that could be install error on my part or due to living in florida where the weather is bipolar (hot 1 min then a category 4 hurricane a hour late) , and the white mode isn't white. It's a mix of colors to make white which it's more of a white/ purple color.Conclusion. For the price they work well I am surprised by the kit for the money. If you want a kit with a all white mode, this isn't going to give you all white.

 Kit is comparable to some of the much higher priced kits. Very bright sticks well if you clean area and use alcohol. The brackets they come with are good quality and help hold it on in case the sticky fails. One side note you can use the app to turn it on an off however you have to install it with a manual power switch if its not tied to ignition because the Bluetooth will kill your battery even powered off in the app.

This is a great product compared to most that's out there on the market. No matter how you wire it, even if you follow instructions and look up different YouTube videos, a kill switch is a must! Rout it to the inside of your vehicle to the side panels and get a touch switch.I rewired this 3 different times before getting a switch. All the other ways drained my battery within 4 days and I had to jump it each time.

 The good :The LED seem bright and good quality the wires are nice and thick the LEDs are in nice waterproof shrouds. Lots of different LED features.The bad and some install TIPS, The brackets they give you are good but the screws they give you are absolutely useless, make sure you get yourself some small short self tapping screws and a screwgun. You want to mount these things high enough where people aren't going to see the LEDs themselves just the glow from them. The adhesive isn't that great either do not trust just the adhesive make sure you use the brackets. The app for your phone seems good and the LEDs have many features. Make sure you install the lights to the body and not on any moving or flexing suspension parts. Keep in mind things that are going to or may heat up and try to run the wires away from them, exhaust Etc

 1. Very bright and cool! Lots of compliments and the app is relatively easy to use and connect.2. VERY difficult to install on a Camaro. I don’t know how other cars are built, but Camaro’s don’t seem to have a lot of room underneath to put the lights, which is why you can see the LEDs. Easy fix, just gotta buy something to cover the sides of the strips.3. Good idea to get professional help when installing on a Camaro.4. We did have to drill into the fuse box to get the wire to stay in there without crushing it.5. One back strip ended up not working once we installed it but the customer service was great, they sent us a new one, so really no complaint there.6. Overall, after dealing with the installation of this, I am very happy. I get lots of compliments and it’s easy to play with on the app. Looks fantastic! Great price, too. I would just recommend having a professional put it in if you don’t know much about cars or have the patience.

 What I love about this is that it is Bluetooth controlled from their app. I have these lights powered to a constant fuse in the engine and I can turn them on and off with the app. Amazon will only allow me one video per review, so I hope you enjoy the one that I have attached here. I have also included some photos that display a few different colors. There are a ton of different options on the app and I cannot include them all here. They are super bright and the speed/brightness  can be controlled via the app as well. In the video, I have the speed turned up all the way so that you could see as many differences as possible. These led strips are also incorporated with 3M self adhesive tape. Top of the line!! There isn’t another set of led lights as nice as these out there!  Don’t hesitate to spend a little more money to get the nicest set of lights on the market. Very easy to install. Just start at the front of your vehicle. Do one side front, side, and rear and then do the opposite side front, side, and rear. My controller is installed in the front and it splits off into two leads. They do not daisy chain around the vehicle in a circle. It’s pretty self explanatory and easy to do. No big deal :)I love them! Thanks guys!!!!

John Kamber,4.0,2021 15 January,"
Ordered these lights and had them installed 7 months ago, recently i saw a few of the LEDS on a strip go from static blue (the only color i had the under glow on) after a few more days it turned into more LEDS and eventually the entire right side of my car. If i change the color it was just flicker every color imaginable while the left side of my car goes to whatever color i change it to. Thankfully i installed a switch because these do drain your battery even while off and you will need jumps if you don't. when the lights are off the strips that are bugging out stay on and flicker white rapidly. the only color that it will not bug out from is you guessed it WHITE. paid for this kit because it was recommended to me but i see people on here having the same exact issue. Customer service was amazing and fast at replacing what they believe to be the parts having issues. 10/10 service

"
carolina,3.0,2021 9 May,"
The kit is decent except for a few problems.1. The bluetooth control unit is very close to where the first led strip is going to go in front of the car so you need to keep it inside the front bumper instead of mounted in the engine bay or even in the interior2. The adhesive tape is really not all that adhesive even after scrubbing with soap and cleaning the area with 91% rubbing alcohol until the surface is cleaner than a dining plate.3. there’s no support from this company that i could find. no contact. so when one of my strips broke, i’m making this review in hopes they will reach out to me so i can just buy a replacement strip instead of purchasing an entire new kit.4. the colors you pick on the app aren’t the same as the color that the LEDs light up. I’m not just saying the color is slightly off. It’s an entirely different color (for example choosing green on the app makes the lights purple) so you have to remember what colors actually result in what on the lights.pro tip: If your car is low, definitely use some rubber scrape guards under the front bumper so your strip doesn’t get torn off like mine.KORJO, if you see this review please reach out to me as i cannot find a point of contact either here or running a search.

Dana Boudreau,5.0,2020 18 July,"
The lights provide a great addition to your car for festive events such as parades and shows. Details like anti-static bags and quality 3M adhesive tape give a hint that this is a quality product. Zip ties and mounting brackets provide redundancy that is prudent for stuff attached under a car. Remember to clean any surfaces to help the adhesive do its job. The light spread works nicely, with good coverage under the car and a nice fade outward. The app control with bluetooth is very helpful and makes it easy to adjust patterns, tempo, and brightness on the fly. Using an app is also great since it allows future upgrades like new patterns (hint hint).  Everything you need is included, just leave enough time (and daylight, and dry weather) since you'll need to remove and replace some wheel well splash guards and do a little wiring under the hood. There's a youtube video showing the whole process. Also, if you have a 12volt supply (spare battery, jumper pack) I recommend hooking everything up ""on the bench"" first to make sure everything works as expected. An inline fuse is a good idea to isolate the light system from the fuse box if anything goes wrong. If you like undercar effects this kit is well worth considering. The seller is very responsive and professional, so rest assured that if any issues arise they will be resolved quickly.

Update: after much trouble shooting the voltage with the supplied cigarette lighter adapter was too low to boot up the Bluetooth module. I put it on a separate 6panel fuse block and it powered up. I dismantled the switch and used it as on on off and re wired it so the lights aren’t on all the time. I did go back and retest my original module and it was bad.Well built-installation was ok took a lot of time to properly install very clean and when it worked it was good for about 15 minutes then shut off and would not turn on again even though the app showed it connected I contacted customer support they promptly sent out a replacement but the replacement was also bad cannot get it to connect to the app.

The product was very well put together. The adhesive did not stick as well as I had hoped, but the plastic parts were more than enough to hold it (although i would have liked a few more). However, the product is advertised as waterproof, and it very mush is not. I had the product for less than a week now, and it started raining while I was out. I started to drive home, and when I stepped out of my car the right and back strips were flashing. I pulled my car into my garage and unplugged it from the fuse box, jacked up my car, only to find water had gotten all inside the led strip at the base of the connector. My lights will now not turn on, and Im unsure what to do. It was not a user error, but the reason i did not leave a 1 star was because I believe it was just an error with the product I received specifically. If possible I would appreciate if my product was replaced.

They look very nice, unfortunately the left side did give me some issues but i reached out to support and Emma helped me get a replacement very quickly, even arrived in 2 days. and I've had the right side for about 5 months now and it still works great.

The cigarette power didn’t work. But everything else is great. I definitely need another cigarette power adaptor because right now i have to take off the lights from the battery.

Garet Bishop,5.0,2022 31 January,"
Love the lights looks amazing on the car but I have bought them too many times. First pair the adhesion comes off the front right. Second time water got in them some how. Third time was my fault and scrapped them off but the fourth time it was the Bluetooth, it will not show up spe110e as the factory bt name of the lights and not I can’t get the name to pull up or to even connect to my phone. I think it’s the Bluetooth box. I have had each set for about 3 months each time. Every time I drive with them on everyone takes pictures and complements on them!
"
Yasmine C.,5.0,2022 7 May,"
I was able to install them with minor issues, though the adhesive is not as strong so I purchased string tape from Lowe’s which did the trick just fine. I did have minor issues with the controller box, which I brought to customer service’s attention and they were super helpful and offered great customer service. I would recommend these to anyone considering them!
"
Lindz,5.0,2022 4 June,"
My husband bought these recently with about average expectations for the money. Similar products that are priced higher don’t always mean better and these lights prove that. These have exceeded his expectations and he couldn’t be happier with the purchase! Would definitely buy again!

Kathleen O. Johnson,5.0,2021 10 June,"
These look great my gen 4 maxima. Spent about 5 hours installing them myself. If I had to do it again (which I may judging by some reviews) I could do it in 3 hours.Using brackets after the adhesive is a must. Your adhesive will fail at the ends eventually due to gravity so be sure to add support there and ever 16 inches or so. As for the provided silicone brackets, I'm sceptical though I did use them along with the provided short screws, too much tightening and the bracket pops off the screw. I had to mount to the frame rail and used a 7/64 drill bit the screws bit well enough.Instead of wiring them to the car or cigarette charger Im using a 20000mAh jump starter with a 12v/10a barrel connection. The lights will run for over 3 hours straight at max brightness and strobe on this device and it can be charged in the car.Bluetooth receiver works well enough it's range is limited.You will get attention with these on your car.

 This product looks absolutely awesome as soon as it is on the car and wired and I absolutely love it. My problem was getting it on the car and wired. The kit came with a cigarette lighter port for power which is a lot easier but me and my friends did it through the battery. We spent a good 4 hours getting it all on the car and screwed in and after that we had to wire it. Wiring wasn’t that bad but we soon realized that with the app there is no way to turn off the lights all the way so it is constantly draining the battery. What we had to end up doing was wiring a kill switch into the car so you can cut power. Kill switch is sick but we had to spend a lot of extra time and money to get it done. Great kit but hard to get on the car and working.

 The product is amazing.Pros:Bright led lightsamazing effectsGreat for the priceCons: Takes a while to Install (But my car was super low) can be done in a driveway.The app layout works, just hard to navigate through the differnt chasing (Moving) effects.Still got the install done and, all strips work also, have not fallen off with the provided extra hardware protection I stall also.This install took me 6 hours (Mostely spent jacking up my slammed car 😂) and was well direction of where to put the wires, for the hard wired option, rather than the cigarette lighter option.Provided a few videos and images for reference.UPDATE, TODAY THE LED STRIPS JUST BROKE, WONT TURN ON JUST FLICKER, THEY ARE ALL IN GOOD PROTECTED SHAPE JUST BURNT OUT I THINK. I have check the wording 3 times all good, they just flicker for a moment then turn back off

"
Terence A.,5.0,2022 14 April,"
The kit is pretty easy to install. Running the lights is a little more extensive since the individual lights don’t separate. The instructions say to run to a fog light fuse. All I did was buy a switch from parts store and ran it from battery with inline fuse so underglow can be on without car running. I would recommend upgrading battery to a gel style to prevent battery from dying
"
JR0LLS,5.0,2022 28 June,"
Solid lights for a great price, I just wish the adhesive was a little bit better as the lights dropped in some spots.
"
Prophet068,5.0,2021 29 July,"
The Glue didn't stick well at all, ended up using other adhesive glue, but once they were in place it was great. I changed them to be one long strip by splicing the end of one to the beginning of the other vs the split processing these come as. If you know what you are doing, i like the contiguous vs half and half but i also do this stuff all of the time. So far they seem to be holding up well. I also changed the controller to use a WLED Based ESP8266, if you know the ESP, and again are comfortable with this stuff its a waaaaay better app than the SP510e, but i get why they packaged this as such. Overall i am happy with the cost of the package because i have tried to make these DIY and wasn't able to get the uniform sealing of the lights like these, nor as solid. Good thick wires, and solid connectors.

Had an technical issue with my lights and snow from customer service walked me thru it and now there working great so I truly recommend these underglow lights I've had other kits but after a year the weather corrodes the connection and other brands just want u to buy another set at a discount. So if your looking for a underglow kit I definitely recommend this brand and once again thanks for great customer service

 I’m writing this review on the merits of the customer service alone. I purchased this kit and installed it on my 2017 Subaru WRX. Unfortunately one half the kit was having issues with LEDs flashing and not showing the proper pattern as the other side. After contacting the seller, I was immediately taken care of and I am waiting on the replacement LEDs.As for the LEDs that were working, the kit is AMAZING. The ability to quickly disconnect the sections of LEDs is a blessing when it comes to taking underside panels off the car. With the correctly configured settings, the lights give your a car a show look. Super easy to install if you have plastic panels under your car or anywhere you can zip tie it. The strip does have a strong adhesive, however I opted for a physical hold onto the strip (zip ties, brackets, and screws included in the kit.) I definitely recommend this kit to anyone on the fence about it.
"
Donk,2.0,2022 19 August,"
I literally got the lights installed fully and then they stopped connecting to the app.  Half are white and the other are whatever I choose on the app.  I checked initially to make sure everything worked and it did and checked periodically during the install and worked. After everything was put into place it stopped working.  Just spent hours installing this product for something to break within minutes not very happy.  They looked great while they were working and was very satisfied with how they looked.  I hope this can get resolved somehow because at this point I feel like I wasted my money for a broken product.

"
Mika,5.0,2021 25 March,"
They are nice and bright but the adhesive isn’t the best but they work. Not sure how they will hold up long term but will update in next few months. As far as connecting to a cigarette port. You will need to go to your fuse box and put in a 30amp fuse. Mine originally had a 20amp and I blew 2 just trying to install and then I just guested that a 30 would work and not blow and it worked. I’m still waiting on a reply from them about how many amps it kicks out because from what I read in the manual it didn’t say much. But for now the 30amp works good. Getting it to connect to your phone at first can be a hassle but when you get it the app is fairly easy to use and the lights are very bright. To give you an idea like the movie fast and furious bright. Yes the first movie. Hopefully this helps you guys.

 Love these lights! Easy install and came with all the hardware and used extra zip ties to sturdy it but came out awesome!Did make the mistake of installing it before testing and only one strip worked :( I did reach out to seller late that night but honestly wasn’t expecting a response since most sellers don’t care. I went ahead and ordered a replacement strip for $27.06 and to my suprise… emma(seller) reached out toMe and actually refunded my $27.06 for the inconvenience!! Sooo awesome! That alone makes me buy 2 more sets here in the next week! But back to the product! Definitely recommend

"
Cody H.,5.0,2021 29 September,"
They are so bright and beautiful, everyone i come across asks me about them and loves them. I've bought several diff kits and by far this is my favorite. The toggle switch on the cigarette lighter is a big bonus, I have my interior, exterior, and subwoofer lights all hooked up to it.The clips that come with it are a big bonus, no other packs have them. Install is super easy, be sure you use WARM SOAP and WATER to wash the area you wish to apply the adhesive to. Dont just slap it on with dust on. Take your time and you will have a really great adhesive stick.Bought my 2nd pair today. Ended up putting one of the strips in the Engine bay/grill, so they are all syncd.Have fun!
"
Gia,5.0,2022 29 March,"
The adhesion goes out very quickly and never held up without using a different tape as well as super glue.  Also, product claimed to be water proof but as soon as water came near the product it completely killed everything and messed up the led that wouldn’t turn off while the rest were off and majority of lights not going on when hued on

Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 30 July,"
These are way brighter then the tube design. The blue car has the tube style also purchased on Amazon. You will need some mechanical experience to install. Each side is all one length so you will need to start from the front and work way back on each side. App is decent and easy to use. It has 20+ programmed motion settings with 5 or 6 color combinations. You will need to add a 10amp in fuse if hardwired. You also need to pull the fuse if not driving the car everyday due to the draw on the battery even if the lights aren't on. My car battery was dead twice. I would recommend these lights 100%. I've only had them for two weeks so I don't know how durable this are yet. I will be purchasing more of these in the future.
"
Aidan 😼,3.0,2022 8 April,"
I installed these and was going good for about a month. They no longer turn on and wish I was able to get another one sent out but not sure if that’s gonna work. I don’t wanna spend money for another set, they are bright and easy to install but sadly doesn’t matter anymore.Update: they did help out with a refund. Not in account yet but hopefully soon
"
Ryan,5.0,2020 7 November,"
Very true impressed with the brightness and colors! My kids love playing and changing the colors from our front window. Haha now Not necessarily hard to install but very time consuming.But about 2-3 weeks after installing one of the front 20inch strips won’t turn off. I’ve tried unplugging that specific strip, on and off all the lights, still stays on. Then the next day after the front strip the first 3 leds on the 60inch side strip stayed on.It looks like water got In some how but I’m not sure.I do recommend then but maybe add some clear caulking to the front and rear of each strip just for extra protectionUpdate- the seller has been more than helpful and willing to do whatever they could to help me get them working again. I replaced the front drivers side and the side LED strip after a refund from the seller. everything seems to be working great now!! highly recommend
"
carl,3.0,2022 24 March,"
The lights are super bright and they have vibrant colors, install was fairly simple and the adhesive on the strips is surprisingly good. The downsides however are that the application is quite clunky and switched power is a must! When the lights are turned off in the app they still draw half an amp of power to run the Bluetooth module so they will drain your battery if you hardwire. Overall though I am quite pleased.

 I have a 2019 10th gen accord sport and the underglow looks awesome on it. The install took me a while though because I wasn’t familiar with wiring to the fuse box and did 90% of the install alone. By myself it took me roughly 4-5 hours to get everything perfect but with friends should take 2-3 hours. I would slightly recommend buying some more clips just to make sure everything is secure. The actual adhesion on the strips is pretty decent but you might need some extra glue. All the wires are plenty long and I would recommend using the zip ties to tie loose wires and to run the wires under the fender liners. Overall though the lights look awesome and the colors are all very vivid and most the the effects are pretty cool. Definitely the best chasing underglow for the price.
"
Brandon,4.0,2021 14 July,"
Only 1 disconnect per side , so don't mount anywhere that youll need to come off the car in the future.. These are 2 strips coming together right at the blutooth box in the engine compartment.  I.e. bumbers or side skirts. That also makes it a bit difficult to hide the excess wire in the car. You'll have to be creative.If I have to take my bumper off for any reason now, I'll have to re 3m the front.Besides that, great 👍

I like the quality of product during unboxing, easy to install, and easy to set up. They are bright and have qlot of settings for lighting effects which is pretty cool. I did however have an issue where a side not lighting up after a week or so, but Customer service gets a 10/10 as they tried helpinge trouble shoot, and ultimately warrantied the faulty unit. People seem to get upset when things do not work, which is understandable, but things happen and things do break. I am thankful for a good company like this, that wants to take care of its customers.  So for me I would highly recommend this kit for any one wanting underflow and stand out from the rest

 Well for the price this kit is great. These lights are bright and the 120 different sequences gives plenty of options to use. The kit is fairly easy to install, but it takes time to route the wires to hide them. I wired them to a switch but the provided 12v adapter works great as well. The adhesive tape provided is stout, but prep the surfaces with a cleaner with an adhesion promoter, and use the buckles for security. I wish these synced with the music like some others, but I’m very pleased with the results.

 Firstly, I love how bright these are. I brought these because they are app-controlled, so one can make any solid color under their car with eye-catching brightness. There are 120 preset color-chasing patterns, so many that there are bound to be several favorites in spite of there not being a custom pattern option, and I personally only use the rainbow pattern or a simple solid color. Favorites can be marked and quickly toggled in the app, and the speed at which the patterns run is very controllable. Custom colors are also able to be saved for quick access at any time the app is connected. I only had one issue with the control module which the seller quickly resolved, and have not had a system problem since. Once connected, my phone stays connected the entire time that I am in/around the car. All in all, it is a fairly simple install and a huge attention grabber!
"
Dion,2.0,2022 22 January,"
I got this and spent a couple of hours mounting it underneath my vehicle with zip ties and such. Went to wire it, and could not get it to work for some reason. After two days, finally got it to work by tapping the power from one of my fuses. Grounded the negative wire. Well, after two days of sitting in my garage, my battery was dead. Even though I had powered the lights off and the fuse I was running off of was headlamps. Which don't supply power when the vehicle is off. But apparently the lights were still drawing power. I jump start my vehicle and low and behold, my entire instrument cluster panel no longer lights up. No gas, no rmp, no speedometer, absolutely nothing. And I have a digital cluster, not an old manual one. So it's completely blacked out now. I changed the fuse to no resolve. Now I have to figure this mess out. But I know one thing, it's thanks to these lights. Would not do this mess again. Two stars because the lights are bright and have many modes. I give them that.

This is actually the 5th set of lights that I get. And THE FIRST FROM THIS SELLER.The lights are perfect, (sadly I have experience), they stick jut perfectly, even though they bring everything you need to screw them. (Just make sure you clean the adhesion area first.) The glow on these lights are astonishing, after 6pm you can turn them on they will be noticed.  The Bluetooth range is impressive, 60+ feet, LOVE THAT. The app is super easy to work with, very simple. 120 preset styles and in my opinion the best things is the little heart it has to mark a pattern as favorite. (Also has like 12 solid colors.)  The customer service is impressively AAAAWESOME, I sent them some email about some doubts and they responded me within an hour!!!!! Loved that, it's hard to found, makes me feel confident when buying.  STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS LIGHTS

...after ~10 uses, several days of rain, and 1.5 months later, the left side doesn't light up anymore. My initial problem was every fuse I tapped, the damn thing would blow out that fuse. No matter what amp I used, no matter what. So I had to connect it to the cig lighter. Keep in mind, I tapped it into my cig lighter fuse, and it blew, but for some reason it functions properly when plugged in. Whatever, no big deal. I really light these lights and I will try to get in touch with the company to send a replacement. You can see what I mean in the photos. That'll get this up to 5 star.Note - the yellow light in the front are my fog lights, not related to the underglow. That little light gap in the front is barely visible in person, also. The first picture was in absolute darkness up in the mountains. The 2nd through fourth were in a very dark town, with some overhead lights on a pizza shop. The last two were early morning in my overly lit city.

Took a few hours to install on my 350z with a friend. Fits nicely. We used battery to power and a chassis ground and wired in a switch to the cabin, soldering with speaker wire. The light wires were a great length in the kit. It worked and looked amazing for a while, then the first module died. Customer service was great and helped troubleshoot and eventually sent me a new one which works well. They recommend 5 amp fuse. I also installed this kit on a friend's s2000 and it looks very bright and easy to use app on both cars. Glad I didnt spend more on a different kit!
"
Jeremy,2.0,2022 10 April,"
Awesome product. not very easy to install since each side is a solid string. The pictures attached where taken with my camera exposure set to the lowest setting. The app they have these locked to is not the best. Id rather have an app that categorizes the light patterns and give the option to setup a custom program. Also the app need to be when I set a favorite I can goto a favorites page and name them. Also it needs to be able to link other lights together so i can change several lights with one app (ex. interior, under, engine bay etc..)Update. This is my 2nd set I've bought. The 1st set the side string started to display half white and no other color, even stayed on after turning off. The 2nd set just started doing the same, except on the opposite side.

 I was ""on the fence"" about ordering these or a more expensive brand that is ""well known"" to my car group. I'm extremely happy I went went these! After the initial install, I had an issue with one of the longer strips staying constant white and it would not change colors or turn off with the app. Within an hour (more like 30min) of sending an email to customer service, I had a response and a new strip on the way with Prime shipping.The app is super easy to use and there are several modes to choose from. So far, they have held up in light rain and we will see how they hold up to a much needed wash and detail.
"
Car Nut,4.0,2021 13 March,"
I enjoyed the install of this kit. The only problem I had was the adhesive that holds the lights. I cleaned the surface before I installed the lights just to hold them in place and it just didn't want to stick. I will say the brackets they supply work very well. After I got the kit installed I turned the kit one and they worked great! I was really happy with how bright they are. Overall I would recommend this kit to anyone that is looking to make their vehicle stand out😁.

I'm thankful for the mounting brackets that came with the lights because the 3m strip on mine DID NOT stick at all. And would STRONGLY recommend adding a bit better directions for hooking them up for people who may be unfamiliar with wiring accent lights BUT those two grievances aside this is a SUPER solid product and if you have the knowledge and experience to install I DEFINITELY 10/10 recommend checking these out

Ordered these for our Polaris Slingshot and installed within about 2 hours with my wife (she's awesome). Kit included everything we needed for installation with connection to the cigarette lighter (in the glovebox). The wiring was fed through the firewall directly into the glovebox which works perfectly in the Slingshot. The brightness isn't what you see in high-end kits but they cost a ton. For the price, we love these! I dinged a bit on adhesion in my rating because I've noticed that a couple of places have come a bit unadhered...however, I zip-tied the heck out of it all, so no problems whatsoever.Finally, after installation, we noticed that part of one of the light strands was not working. Customer service was very quick in getting a replacement strand out to us which solved the problem. I appreciate the service!

 Had these for one month and they are still working perfectly. Easy to install. Lights are bright. App for pattern control is ok. Would definitely purchase it again though.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 23 November,"
Fairly straightforward installation and app is easy enough to use. Mounted correctly these strips light up the complete underside of my truck and still shine out a bit to all four sides.  Had an issue with one side and the seller promptly remedied the situation, and had it going again a few days later. Now my girlfriend wants a kit because this 6 piece kit far outdoes her 4 piece.

I hate the Bluetooth connection ONLY cause u must have LOCATION ON in order to connect but the kit is super bright even on daylight.Is very hard to get it done on a supra compared to my civic Type R.Highly recommended for those who love undercarriage neons.

"
Levi Payne,4.0,2021 17 June,"
After just under a year of having the whole kit and a few extra lengths on my car, everything works great except for one or two lights went out. Unfortunately they don't manufacture just the replacement strips anymore but Emma gave me a partial refund and guided me in the right direction for a replacement. Awesome company to work with and I'm very satisfied with the results either way.
"
Tamara,5.0,2021 15 January,"
The kit is easy to install but the vehicle will obviously play a bigger part in that. I wired it to my positive battery terminal and to my grounding spot on my MK7 GTI. I wired in a kill switch inside the driver's side compartment so I can turn it on and off while driving. You can adjust the brightness and speed of blinking/color changing. The app is straightforward. The only issue I had is one of the strips lost adhesion from the foam tape and was dragging on the road and filed right through the wires. Emailed customer service and got a refund to purchase a new rear strip. Every part of this kit can be bought seperatly which is awesome if this situion happens to you. Don't be afraid to purchase!

 For anyone new to working on their car thinking about installing this under glow is not easy to install. It can definitely be done, but there’s a huge learning curve for how to run your wires and where to place lights. This kit comes with everything you need to get the job done, except I’d recommend using some JB Weld to glue on the ends. looks super cool even in the daytime though
"
Kevin ,5.0,2022 8 January,"
These worked great on my car before I sold it. Installation is not for the faint of heart. But, the difficulty of installation has nothing to do with this product. I'm just giving a fair warning. I didn't experience any defects or issues while running these. I got compliments everywhere I went.
"
Abdias,1.0,2021 14 August,"
So where can I start, first I just wanna day the positive things cause there’s way to many negative stuff from my side. Well the brightness of this lights are great, can’t complain about brightness on this set. They stick very well to you car and I love how they have some hangers to bolt down the lights just to make it safer. It wasn’t that easy to install but that’s just cause of my car and the way I wanted them other than that pretty easy.Now the negative part:1. I don’t know if is the app or the lights that can’t seem to understand each other, when I press blue the light goes red, when I press red the lights goes blue.2. At the app There’s so many options for absolutely no reason when you finally find the right one so the lights respond to the color of your choice, the motion give the lights a stroke, meaning they just stop working and turn into white color and won’t change back to the color you want till they give a F*** to change back. Sometimes on side of the car goes one color and the other side another, or they don’t work.3.When they say they don’t wanna turn off, well guess what, they won’t turn off, I have to open the hood and disconnect the damn switch so they can turn off. After a 20 minutes of fighting for them to turn off. I honestly don’t recommend this set of light there’s so many bad thing I can say about them but just don’t buy them, Save you the trouble. A set of under glow lights should be easy to control not having a hard time and spending a lot of time just to try to make them work, cause they work whenever they want to work.

 Hardware supplied made for a very easy install minor modification to my rear bumper for clean install look but overall very satisfying with the look and quality of the product I have a really long car so I wish it came with extra pair of lights for the rear or maybe a plug to add additional lights just fill that but honestly not deal breaker for me super happy never liked the underglow lighting but this was game changer the chaser lighting is head turner every time and the brightness is amazing Plan your job well and this will be a breeze clean all contact areas well for best results

 I bought these as a gift for my girlfriends frs. They started to come off about after a month. To make it worse the colors stopped working with the app and wouldn't change to the right color. They looked really good at the start. I just wished they would've lasted longer.
"
Ruby,5.0,2021 6 March,"
We had an issue installing the product on to our turbo Miata where one of the strips broke. They sent us a replacement the next day and am super impressed with the response time. We love our little turbo miata and thought it would be fun to put these lights on our go-kart of a car. My boyfriend just installed them this morning and we played around with the settings with the lights off in our garage--will post pictures/videos once we take it out during night time! I'm super impressed with how many fun and different settings there are on the app! 10/10 would recommend. We ended up just using caulking to apply it on our car since the adhesive didn't stick very well.
"
Kpt.Krispy,5.0,2020 4 March,"
Like most lights you find in auto part stores and online, I was expecting these to be like the rest. I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of these light. The box they come in is nice. They took care to package them in anti static bags and they come with all the hardware you could possibly need. High quality 3M adhesive plus mounting brackets for extra security in your investment. Zip ties to keep everything clean. It even came with a cigarette lighter switch if you wish to turn it on/off from there. I personally opted out of that because I found wiring it to the fuse box was much easier. (Instructions included and very easy to follow) There's only one thing it requires and that's a wire adapter for the negative end to the battery terminal.  (Wire connectors if using the cigarette lighter switch) overall I was very satisfied with my purchase and the color chasing effect are very nice!

 I bought these 6 months ago. I had them connected toy battery. It drained it when parked in a garage for my weekend in NOLA. I unhooked them until I got a switch installed. Well 6 mo the later without being used but still attached to my car, still work without any issue!

REALSTEEL  MOTORCARS,5.0,2021 11 January,"
I am the one who placed the order and the install for my grandson. I am  old school muscle car guy not a light up the bottom of the car guy. Anyways hard wired it in with a relayFor key on only, no wires can be seenand no dead batteries due to forgot to turn off the lights. I think it's a good product but the install isn't like hanging cheap Christmas light better to have a radio /alarm shop hard wire it, finding the signal wire is not in the instruction manual alarm guy's or GPS guys know how to find the right wire .... As a used car dealer mechanicI remove after market electronics all the time. 3 star rating on install...

 I have Bought many different led light strips from Korjo for many different uses. I love using the Korjo lights because of the many different color options that they come with. Korjo also does an amazing job with the Dream color function of the lights that other Led's cannot do. Overall great lights I have had them for over 3 months now for under glow on 2010 my smart car passion.

 Pretty good lights, mines is the one with only under glow lights. The two with lights on top, are another brand. The white with lights on top. Are Lite Up The Nite. Mines isn’t as bright. But also are less than half the price. The app works well. I’ve been using them every day for a week now. I’m happy, Just need more. Very easy to install, overall good buy.

I have a Jeep JL and I love these lights. They are bright, use very little power, and have a lot of patterns to choose from. The Bluetooth works great with my phone. I left a pattern running on Halloween night with my car turned off and it barely used any of my battery. It was a great deal.

Matthew Leon,4.0,2021 18 March,"
Installation is simple, remove the tape and stick onto your vehicle, use zipties to hold the underglow up incase it ever decides to fall one dayBrightness is great for the value and the options you get are pretty amazing!I would purchase these if you want underglow for your vehicle and are on a budget for your project vehicle!Only thing I would wish for is if the sides could have came with longer strips,but overall not disappointed
"
ramil ,3.0,2021 24 November,"
So I ordered this product twice the first time I ordered it was amazing everything was perfect it was actually waterproof and the clips were soft that could be installed easily but BUT THE SECOND TIME. I feel like I got a really cheap product that doesn’t have any waterproofing at all or anything the clips are really terrible and doesn’t bend at all I haven’t checked the brightness I’m still installing it but this time I think ihv gotten a cheaper led
"
Kai Ukamea,5.0,2022 2 January,"

Jake,5.0,2020 9 October,"
I had just recently purchased These lights about two weeks ago and I got them installed and they ran great they were super bright and they are so many different modes that you can select on the app. About a week after I had them I had went over a curb in my two front LED’s strips got destroyed because the curb was too high, and I reached out to customer service and they got back to me in about 12 hours and sent me two new front LEDs free of charge their customer service is great and will get back to you super quickly. I have washed my car myself and driven in the rain with no water issues yet and stayed on great. And for the price it was much worth it!
"

Joshua,5.0,2021 7 July,"
This product is awesome the adhesion is super sticky. Def recommend cleaning obviously before use. Due to my new car it was a pain hiding wires I had to pull tires and inner fenders out but that’s part of the game. I installed a fuse and a switch myself and wired it to my battery directly so it doesn’t pull power at all times cause I believe it will.  The Bluetooth seems to work seamlessly but it’s a pain that it doesn’t come with a remote also. A remote beside just your phone would be nice. But great product!
"
Duy Huynh,5.0,2021 27 April,"
I love these lights!!! I couldn't be happier with the result. A note, VERIFY YOUR GROUND. This was an easy installation and they look great at night. You have many choices in the colors and how you would like to have them shown. . They look amazing and are super easy to install. Overall love the kit and the service you get from the company. Colors look great and are bright for my need. My favorite part is the dimmer on the remote. You can turn them down pretty low which is great when your out camping and it’s pitch black out. Great buy. Well worth the money !

 These lights were even better than I thought they’d be. They are cheaper than ones you can get from the store considering they are blue tooth and they have 6 strips instead of 4. The spies are long and really bright. Plus the Bluetooth hasn’t messed up on me yet. You can customize different patterns or choose a solid color. Took about an hour and a half to install since my car is low and I didn’t have a jack. The adhesive is surprisingly great it really shocked me how good it stuck to the car. Plus the package came in about a week before it was expected to.Ps I was confused on where to power them but there should be a fuse box under your hood with a positive bolt that worked perfect for me

The LED lights were very bright. Highly recommend to use better adhesive. I give it a 3 stars beacuse I would of loved to have a controller come with it to leave in car because my for some reason would work to begin with but after playing with them they work perfect and still do. BUT!!! The color white is not so white as you know the color white. It’s more purple blueish so I was not very happy with that since I wanted the white mainly while in the road but over they are mighty bright!

 Lights work great wish the app had more options to customizeStick tape sucksMake sure you have zip tiesThe clear clips they send are great but they did not send nearly what you need (but zip ties worked after drilling some holes)Also make sure you supper glue the very ends to the clips bc they will come out of the clips
"
Nick,5.0,2021 10 May,"
This is prolly one of the best underglow’s I have worked with, the adhesive is super strong making installing super easy, only problem I can across is on the sides I had to drill holes for the screws but that’s okay. Over 120 custom colors, u can change how to pattern goes like from the front to the back, the back to front and the sides from front and side to back. U can change the amount of pixels it produces, brightness, how fast how slow the pattern goes, and best of all this is one of the brightest underglows out there

Liked them so much my husband bought himself some and my mom and dad want some too!!

UPDATE:: Seller contacted me and offered me a new set or a refund. World class customer service.  She did not have to do that and would only do it if she was confident in the product. That in itself is worth 5 stars to me. Bravo. Followed directions to the letter. Lasted less than 2 months and fell off going down the highway. Caught the plug and ripped the whole set off and damaged my terminals.  Not a good product.

Was good until today, if you get the item and it’s defective at all have no mercy and return that ish. I just missed my return window and when I got it there was a slight defect and I didn’t mind it but today it rained pretty good and I noticed that one of the lights were a different color and I tried changing it and it didn’t work and then I tried to fix it by just tapping on that side and usually it would work but nope not today and after I took a really good look at it, there was a piece on the seal missing and moisture and water got in since I’ve had it but while it lasted it was good but 1 month of it working didn’t satisfy me at all
"
Ethan Miller,5.0,2021 7 July,"
Install was easy just time consuming and I love the brightness and the quality of the lights. The only bad thing about this is that 1 strip would only flicker then shut off or just never turn on and now im stuck with only half the car being underglow. Still waiting for customer service to reply to me. Would be 5 stars if both strips workedEDIT: Customer Service sent out a new strip for me and it came next day and now it works perfectly.
"
Dominic Wiggins,5.0,2021 3 November,"
With this kid you honestly can’t go wrong. It is simple to install it comes with adhesive strip at the bottom to stick to the car with the brackets to mount up the lights to your liking. And doesn’t require major installation to give you a car that unique look that you like.

I've had some LEDs on the strips burn out and start malfunctioning. Still waiting to hear back from seller... Other than that the 120 modes are cool and brightness is pretty decent!
"
Stephen Bartlett,5.0,2021 18 July,"
Product is fully functional the adhesion is nice if you have a flat surface to stick it to but I definitely used the mounting brackets that came with it and the zipties came in handy too.  Wired it directly into my fog lights because if you wire it directly to battery will drain the battery so now if foglights ar on they are on.  The app to use them is easy enough to use with a little time tinkering with it and figuring it out.

 I love these lights!  Someone finally did what i've been asking for and gave us a kit that begins and ends in the middle of the vehicle, not off to one side.  It's a small detail but it makes a world of difference in how it looks.  My only complaint is that the front strips could stand to be a little wider for bigger vehicles (Mine are on a Dodge Ram)  Another plus is being able to add a name to each controller in the app as well!

 I installed these on my camper trailer. Install went well, great adhesive just make sure you use alcohol and remove any grease or oil. I mounted mine to a switch inside the cabin. Awesome lights and very bright.Only knock I can do and I'm not sure if it's the software or the hardware, but some of the light colorways are kinda weak. There are Maybe 4 or 5 really good color variances, all the others I'd never use.

I love the product! Easy to install. The adhesive on it worked well except for one spot that I don't think I cleaned well enough. Was a bit. Annoying getting the wire over the wheel well. The strip would get stuck halfway. As for color it is amazing. I had the rainbow strobes on in McDonalds and had a compliment given to me. Had it all installed maybe 45 mins. Just make sure your state laws are okay with them. The town police didn't like them as much while I drove.

 These came out amazing. Cleaned the area well and it stuck on no problem. Little bit of a project getting the wires through the engine bay and around the front(steering) tires. But it comes with zip ties although I used my own. The one thing you want to make sure you have is terminals that connect to the wires that way you can connect the lights to power(battery). All controls are on app directions are a little tricky but pretty straightforward for the most part.

I purchase some under body lights few weeks ago was impressive but saw these on Amazon and decided to try them they easy to install the wires are good quality grade long enough to wrap around your car no cutting no splicing. These lights will make eyes turn..I wish the app could me more simple but u gotta play with it to customize it to your liking .lights worth every penny they super bright even in the daytime they stood out.

 Well if your looking for an awesome look and a cool feature for your car that will stand out this is definitely it it’s reasonable, the app works great you won’t be disappointed. I put on my underglow on  2015 Dodge Challenger  and it is awesome, I love driving down the road and people can see my daytime lights.  The installation was a lengthy project, but once you get done you feel certain that it will last and won’t fall apart like some of the cheaper kits, but other than that it’s a great product and definitely worth trying out if you wanna stand out.

I love that it has an over abundance of color lighting variations/sequences. The ability to speed and slow the movements and the control of brightness is awesome! I can easily set the right mood and pick out my favorite light sequences. I would Highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to add more lighting to their RV.

 This kit is beyond amazing. It comes with 6 led strips rather than your typical 4 led strip kit for more coverage. The brightness is unbelievable as well, you can definitely see it in the morning which is dope. Going on to the most important part, the 120 different effects you can choose from, the chasing effect is epic, you can customize the speed of the chase effect which is nice, in the video I uploaded I slowed down the chase effect for the first couple of modes, the last mode I have the speed on 100 so you can have an idea on how fast it can be. Install was self explanatory & easy. Took me about 1 after I lifted my car off the ground. I already got so many compliments on the lights!!!

These lights are very easy to install if you have ramps or a lift. If you have tinkered with cars before, then hiding the loose wires will be easy as well. These light draw in a lot of positive attention and I was able to get a couple of people to buy some because they were very impressed with the results and the different light variations.Please check your state laws for which color you cannot drive with. In my state, it is illegal to use blue so I use every other color but blue unless I'm not driving on the road, then I would use it.

The lights I got were very bright and easy to install, and I was very happy with how they looked, especially for the price. When one side of the lights went out, I reached out via the email and got a response within a day and a replacement with no hassle. Highly recommend this product!

 I got them installed from a custom shop today and I got to see how they look at night finally and the colors are REALLY nice. The app is kind of confusing but you just have to play around with the variations to see which ones you like. I like how you can adjust the brightness. This is a really nice kit and good for the price too!

So far everything works great. No effect from washing vehicle or rain. Only negative is, I have trouble connecting to bluetooth sometimes. After it connects it works like it's supposed to.

Loved these lights!! Easy to install! Super bright!!! Crazy color combinations and seemingly endless different color patterns! However three days after the warranty was up all four of the lights in the back stopped working. I've been trying to figure out how to fix them. Still recommend them. But check on them frequently

 What amazing lights! I purchased the Chasing lights for my house a few months ago. Then they came out with lights for my car! Believe me I’m picky about my car so I did some research!I was convinced these automobile chasing lights were high quality and suitable for my Mustang GT! I do a lot of parades and car shows and I knew these lights would make my car shine and boy was I right! I did a Christmas parade and everyone was amazed how the lights chased each other and change colors! (120different patterns) My car was the star of the parade, well besides the Big man himself Santa! I highly satisfied and would recommend these lights!** when hooking up light please hook them into your fog light! Factory recommended**

Lauie Davis,4.0,2021 26 February,"
I installed these lights in early January and they worked great for a few weeks and then they stopped working.  I reached out to the vendor for help and have yet to get any response.  Any suggestions what I can do to get help to get these working again?
"
Mourt,1.0,2022 11 October,"
After my packages arrive I started to set up the underglow , when I was half way done setting it up under the car I then realized I should test to see how bright it is, once I hooked up the wires and everything it wasn’t working so I reread the directions and watched the YouTube video , still wasn’t working - so I decided to go to a shop and they told me the cigarette part wasn’t working. WASTE of my DAMN  money and time

"
Steven,5.0,2020 10 August,"
As you can tell by the title these stripes are very very long or at least for my Mazda 6 but regardless. Great lights for a pretty good price! nice and easy to install I have a Mazda 6 It took me an hour to fully install these lights. One issue I do have is that the app doesn’t name all the functions it’s just numbers them 1-120. I understand that there are just so many that it  just numbers them but could have a function in which I you could name them yourself but regardless great lights with very cool colors and patterns.
"
Martin hernandez,3.0,2021 16 November,"
The first time I purchased this product everything was great, lights performed well, however the second set of these lights I purchased came defective. Even after turning off lights, one bar would stay on and would drain my car battery completely

 The Lights were pretty easy to install. I only had trouble with finding a spot to place them on my BRZ (Not a lot of flat surfaces for the sides). I also ended up replacing the 3M tape on the side lights with Velcro tape for a stronger grip. Over all these lights are pretty bright and I really like them. Recommend them to anyone looking for a inexpensive under glow.

 Love love love them! Just take you're time and run through wires good. Keep away from moving parts and exhaust of course.  Adhesive is very good but it also comes with these plastic brace thingies. They will never fall off ! Overall install took me around 3 hrs. Did take few breaks cause the weather outside was just too hot.

 The lights work great! I have never done something like this before to a car but I am very satisfied. The adhesive is good, not great, but an easy fix with some gorilla double sided adhesive. The installment process is tedious if you don’t know what you’re doing (like me) but it can easily be done. The fuze wiring isn’t hard just make sure you have the connector/jumper (sold separately). The lights are great though! Very bright and fun. They have SO MANY different modes which I loved. Overall 10/10 would recommend.

 The kit is very durable, it’s been through rain, car washes and high speeds I’ve had no problems with it, the only thing I would like to see changed is the app, other people can connect to my vehicle and turn my lights on which has happened 3 times and has caused me to have a dead battery all three times which is a huge hassle and inconvenience.  I love the colors and the brightness, it wasn’t hard to install on my car 2015 Dodge Challenger.

So I bought this led light kit for my car but the first one didn't work because it didn't have a second module. The light was flashing and couldn't connect to the Bluetooth device on my phone. I asked for a replacement and the second one worked as it supposed to. The second one has a second module (black box) which I believe made this kit work.

**update - customers service was extremely professional, sent me out a whole new set up. Very grateful to have a company take pride in there product and responsibility when it is necessary, great product, lights are amazing and many features  9/10 would recommend (9 given the first experience) **This product is great when it comes to the brightness but the quality isn’t there, I just got my light installed and one side does NOT work, it’s doesn’t change sequence, it doesn’t change colors at all it will just stay on white. Very disappointed as I waited a while for them to arrive and about the same time to install and payed quit a bit to have them installed as well. Was definitely looking forward to these lights :((

Daniel,5.0,2021 11 March,"
Nice! I like the colors. App works good. Easy install. Didn’t need to put any double sided 3m tape. I didn’t connect it to the battery because I didn’t want my battery to drain since it’ll be a live wire all the time. So i connected it to a fuse box and I installed a toggle switch that I can flip up and down on the car so it does not drain the battery.

Product is great for cosmetic purposes only. I would highly recommend adding an add a fuse link to tie into your fuse panel.

Mr. Briggs,5.0,2020 3 October,"
I am very impressed with this kit so far! Easy to install and use. I did have one small rear strip not working fully but I emailed the support email address and they sent a replacement right away with no problem.I had to rely on the adhesive for the rear strips, so time will tell on those as far as how long it will hold.I feel this kit works better when closer to the ground for some of the effects. But overall I really like it!

alex ferrell,5.0,2020 8 August,"
Great looking lights, very bright and very solid looking, you get 120 different color chasing modes and although a couple do look relatively the same they are all pretty cool to look at. The app let's you control speed and brightness of the lights as well. Installation was easy enough just wipe down the area with isopropyl alcohol real good and let dry, would also recommend using a couple one hole straps to help hold them up. Customer service is great too, always a speedy response via email and always seems happy to help.

To be honest the lights looked great but sadly they didn’t last long. However teh customer service may be the best I’ve experienced. It did take a little while for a reply but I only got responses that made sure I was satisfied which is amazing. Definitely purchase these because they do look great and worst car scenario the customer service representative will take care of you and solve your issue.

Starfish,5.0,2020 25 May,"
I bought this item for my Grandson's new car (he's 18) and he was thrilled with it.  The lights are vibrant, colors are gorgeous.  Easy to use with the app on his phone with lots of choices of how you want the colors to show up.  He said it was a little harder installing than he thought it would be, but did get them on.  My husband wants these for our golf cart so guess what he's getting for Father's Day??!!  The ordering was easy and delivery was perfect.
"
Jeffrey Pfaltzgraff,3.0,2021 24 March,"
Great product, multiple times that the zip ties snapped off, and lights sagged down. One time wire cut in half so I had to buy a replacement strand. I drove on a gravel road, and left side got torn in half, and right side had 2 holes straight through the strand of lights, along with the wire going to the back lights disconnected from strand. As long as it is properly fastened to the vehicle and take good care of it, this product will last a long time. The app was easy the navigate as well.

 I like the lights and and how they chase. Very bright but color coordination does not match up. When you try one color it's coming up a different color if you use red is coming up green if you use blue is coming up . different color not what you're trying to get and the app is horrible with communicating. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app for different times to get it to catch a signal

UPDATE MAY 2022: Purchased a second kit since I was previously extremely happy with my purchase. Obviously they lowered the product quality. Weather proof cover around the led lights are terrible quality. Wire gauge is higher (thinner wire). I took off 2 stars. From 5 to 3 stars. Such a disappointment!!!April 2021: Its almost like a headlight brightness. I can easily see the light reflection from the road even sitting in the driver seat. Dont hesitate to buy this product. Best underglow material by far.

 Product is good and bright only issue I have is that the length of the cables coming from the box are very short making you place the box somewhere in the engine bay. Hopefully it holds up to the heat and elements of driving..Update.. had one of my light fail so I ordered a second set and when it came it was different then the first no longer do each light connect individually now there all connected in a line. So my easy replacement turned into a full removal and replacement product changed and not for the better before you could not use every light now you have no choice.
"
michael,1.0,2022 21 July,"
I had a problem with one side one week after install on the first set.  They did send a replacement and they were great after that.  Now less than 3.months  later the other side half of the LEDs don't work.  I recommend this particular set to the people who asked where I got them from...however now I'm thinking these are not good for the long run, as I should get years out of a product like this.  Warrenty is only good for 30 days.  If they read this and make it right, I'll change my review, otherwise don't buy.  Many other options on here at a better price point, that may last longer than 2 1/2 months.

Can't speak on how hard the install is, cause I had professionals install it, but as the overall look, it's great. Pics provided of them on my car, gives you option of having it as a solid color, or the multicolored, as well as speeds on the multicolored. Only had these 1 and a half days, but they are great so far and I dont see it getting worse. Definitely will turn your car, or whatever you use it for into a head turner. I got looks from literally everyone that I passed in the popular shopping district near me.

I’ve already installed 4 of these same kits on different cars because of how good they are. 10/10 would recommend.

"
Luis Javier Perez,5.0,2021 17 January,"
Absolutely loved the product. I cleaned my car with rubbing alcohol first and then stuck on the lights and it hasn’t come off since and the car has been through rain, flood and highway speeds. The brightness is amazing too. And it has a ton of cool modes. Will definitely purchase again for my other cars.

Ok so it did take longer to install than I anticipated, but man was the reward worth it!!  This product is AMAZING!  Customer service was OUTSTANDING!  Helped me through any issues I had and responded very quickly.  Would highly recommend this product to anyone.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 28 August,"

Terence Irby,5.0,2020 23 December,"
The adhesive is garbage I had to use double sided tape with the adhesive in order for the lights to stick. But the screw-in clamps are a life saver! But overall if you not mechanically incline don’t buy this. But if you are mechanically savvy or you have a shop to go to then yes this is perfect!

Very good for the money, will last at least two years, one side broke due to water damage, but I had the older version, seller honored the one year warranty and sent out a new upgraded version for the side that broke.
"
Vanessa,4.0,2021 26 March,"
Everything is great about these lights except for the fact that they don’t work no more only lasted me 3 months.
"
Ryan,3.0,2021 2 October,"
There is absolutely no way to turn off/on light in the app. If you connect them to the battery they will stay on the entire time.

 these are perfect. they have so many different modes that you will guaranteed find one you like. installation is fairly straight forward. the product overall is the best option on the market with bright leds and so many modes to satisfy any buyer. 10/10 recommend no issues at all.
"
Michael,5.0,2020 29 August,"
First off let me say these are QUALITY lights. The installation was super easy. The app had no hiccups. I installed this in less than 2 hours (I was recording the install).I have received nothing but compliments on this light setup. Even a few of my friends ended up ordering it.Do not hesitate to make your purchase. You will not be disappointed.

 The adhesive tape works well I would recommend more than just the glue to be sure nothing comes a loose but it's easy to install and gorgeously bright and colorful
"
Kania Brown,5.0,2021 24 June,"
Looks great and bright during the day time. The adhesive is much better compared to other cheaper kits. Installed on my Dodge Charger scat pack. Going to upload a demo video showing off the lights on my YouTube Channel RichHomieCao
"
Kindle Customer,5.0,2020 22 September,"
The light kit was easy to install and looked great.  The vendor has very quick shipping and an OUTSTANDING Warranty.  My grandson installed the lights and really enjoyed them.  Unfortunately, one of the strips was damaged after installation and when I contacted the vendor they sent out a new light strip immediately!!!  Great support and a great product!
"
Alec,5.0,2020 3 October,"
The lights were very easy to setup, and very bright! The only negative thing about the lights in the adhesive, I took time to zip tie the lights just as a safety percussion, and they work amazing! Great lights, and for the price they're just amazing! I recommend them to anyone looking for a pair of cheap lights that work well!
"
jeff,5.0,2021 26 August,"
They work awesome no issues with mine month in.  Make sure they tucked up good.  They will get ripped off quite easily even with the brackets.  Looks great
"
Michael Paige,5.0,2021 7 December,"
Worked really well and has a lot of features
"
Mauricio Berber,5.0,2021 4 March,"
I highly recommend this kit because it has a ton of options on patterns, it looks really nice at night, and its high quality. Long gone are the days of installing neon tubes under the car and hoping they didn't break. Overall loved this purchase and the value.
"
Mike,5.0,2020 29 July,"
Fairly easy to install, sticks well but also comes with hardware to clamp it in place for extra stick and strength. You can do almost any color and even do jumping lights. The lights are fairly bright and you can adjust how bright you want them as well. As long as you can figure out how to tuck your wiring I would so far recommend this product
"
Jeremiah Y.,5.0,2021 4 August,"
I asked for a warranty one them since they have a 1 year warranty and my passenger side failed and they didn't give me the warranty they refunded me $27.... why didn't I get a warranty??
"
Alexandr Mikhailov,5.0,2021 4 August,"
Great Product! The cable length was pretty long to reach every side of the car, different kind of colors available through the app! You can choose custom mode, or just 1 Color at the time!
"
Zane Cozad,3.0,2021 19 August,"
I love these lights the brightness was perfect and I got tons of compliments on them however the box that controls the lights has failed and now I cannot get anything to light up.
"
Jason,3.0,2021 6 July,"
I ordered the same kit to use as replacement strips after one of the strips went out and the 2nd kit was different with connectors that weren't compatible so I had to completely redo the entire install instead of replacing the one strip that was bad
"
Anthony Servin,5.0,2020 4 October,"
Customer service is great! I had a couple small issues but the customer service is top notch and they always make sure to make it right. I would 100% recommend and buy again.Lights are also very bright and easy to use with the app as well. Install was simple and the provided hardware helped a ton.
"
Noah ,5.0,2021 11 June,"

"
Beatriz Hernandez,3.0,2021 22 February,"
We got these for a 220 A class Mercedes Benz. Adhesive was not strong at all. We had to figure out any other way to stick them. One full strip did not work so it was useless since the back side was way lighter than the rest of the car. Ended up taking these off and taking it somewhere to get other ones that have not given us any problems!!

"
That man ,4.0,2020 4 May,"
I would give it 5 stars if it had a better app. The lights look great. So many different chase features. But they need a way to label each chase feature instead of trying to remember what number do what.
"
MiasmicXanax808,5.0,2021 3 May,"
Very good product! Seller is very nice and reasonable so there's no worries as to buying this. The lights are bright, mine did have some small issues but the seller is more than willing to compensate and send replacements!
"
Cristina Mendoza,5.0,2021 11 August,"
The lights are good quality for the price . They are bright and have many different settings to it. Install is just a bit hard but nothing too difficult.
"
Pat Philips,3.0,2021 5 February,"
I received this in early November and shortly after receiving it I installed it. over the last week (three months after installing)I have had connectivity issues with the light strips. At first I thought there might be a loose wire or something but I have confirmed that all connections are good. Currently I cannot get the lights to turn on and it doesn't even register as a Bluetooth device.

 Pretty good quality and price. Easy install besides running the wires through the fenders. Adhesive is strong, and I just zip-tied any loose areas. The app has fast and easy connection, and it has 120 color pattern combos. Customer support is great and fast if you have questions or need replacements.IG: @asian.wrx
"
Timmy Jahson Jahzmania,1.0,2022 24 September,"
Installed it and about to finish up suddenly my little niece stepped on the wire, it immediately turned off I looked everywhere no wire disconnected or anything of sorts just the light won't turn back on. I'm super disappointed to have my $60 wasted.

Lura D.,5.0,2020 21 April,"
We have this installed on our Veloster.  We love this kit so much it is our second time purchasing.  First set we didn't have secured properly and it got caught on something in the road at some point and broke.  This time around we have learned from our mistakes and everything is well secured and working great.  Takes a little bit to install but isn't difficult.
"
Gisselle,5.0,2021 14 July,"
So basically, it’s a really good underglow kit. The front part didn’t really reach the edges of the front so that was an issue so you have to kinda just like diy it.
"
Gavin Scott,2.0,2021 10 November,"
The customization is awesome, app control was nice to have and it was a good brightness. Adhesion I had no issues with but I also haven't had for the longest time so, that may be an issue soon. However, after a few days of rain, a whole strip on the side has already went out. At first it started flickering random colors in certain sections, but now, the right side strip has ceased to work. A little bummed that they are already starting to break after some rain.

 Very well packaged and seems to be a very durable product. The leds a super easy to install by someone with limited knowledge and with limited tools compared to some units you may buy. The first set I got had one bad strip in it but they had me another set by the next day so no complaints their. They have amazing color and are very bright I love them would recommend to my friends
"
Cody,1.0,2022 25 August,"
Worked for like a month and then just stopped connecting to my phone. took it out to find that the black box on the controller part was all disformed from overheating which allowed water to get in. When I ordered a new controller and installed that one not even 5 minutes went by and the thing was hot to the touched. Just a defective kit all around.
"
Humberto Cera,3.0,2021 16 January,"
I loved this kit, it looks way better than ones I have used on other cars before. I had it on for about two weeks and then the driver side stopped working. I'm really not trying to remove it all and get the replacement and then have to install it all over again. It would helpful if we could purchase just one of the sections for replacement.

 you’ll need better screws for the brackets it comes with, and you better use all the brackets it comes with if you’re driving a lowered car & or in a state that snows. i loved my underglow but due to a blizzard and me only being 10” off the ground.. it didn’t last long
"
Arthur Padilla,3.0,2021 5 April,"
They fell off about after one day and some rain. I then had to follow up with the zip ties but then they were droopy because it didnt come with enough zip ties to put them every 3 inches. Id recommend a professional install or at a minimum put some super glue down

 These lights are really worth the money. They can be dimmed for a soft glow or turn them up, theres so many functions I never can decide on just one. I wish I could have included more than 1 video. Sorry I was looking for darker area than the lighted area in video. Install was super easy no special tools or anything like that. Very good quality.

Jawad,5.0,2020 2 September,"
One of the brightest underglow kit in the market!! I’ve had 3 underglow kits before from overrated brands but they were not brighter than these. This brand is definitely underrated. You’ll definitely turn heads on streets with this bright underglow kit! The customer service is awesome! They’re here for us 24/7. Highly recommend it💯
"

"
Stan B.,3.0,2020 24 September,"
The lights work well. App is a bit strange. Mounting the lights was horrible. Adhesive doesn’t stick well and the self tapping screw mounts will break or are a pain. I wired to cigarette lighter as I didn’t want them hard wired. Cool if you can figure out a good way to mount them but good luck with that. I had 4/6 strips come free in the span of a week (granted with heavy aggressive driving)

 Lights are very bright the two way tape on the back of this is crap doesn’t stick very well I had to mount every 6 inches clamp because they would not stick to the plastic at all even being clean with alcohol would not stick Other than that I’m generally very happy with them other than I was hoping to not have to put that many clamps on

"
CRYSTAL C.,1.0,2022 4 May,"
I have been through four sets of these lights in within a month of installing them and one way or another they stopped working or break. When they do work they work good very bright colors. I love the rainbow options. But for $80 and they only work for maybe a month it’s definitely not worth it. The adhesive they sent with it is definitely not made for the underneath of a car. And unless you have a car lift that can lift your vehicle a few feet off the ground it is next to impossible to drill the little screws that they include in the kit into the bottom of your vehicle.

Hello I received these lights and installed them, they work awsome super bright and stands out from the other $30 underglow kitsI did receive a broken led strip had it replaced and got a new one ASAP but once installed the new one had a few lights not working causing the rest not to change colors, definitely recommend these lights I just got 2 bad sets

Great hardware and super straight forward and easy to install, not very bright though. I own a relatively small 2Dr coupe and the strips even overlap in some spots yet the light barely bleeds out from under the car when the strips are on at night.

This is my very first time putting in underglow lights and worst experience yet. I have no idea how to even describe this but say wow. I don’t understand how the cord and the light bust/explode. My whole right side of my under light don’t even turn on and most of the lights are burned out. I for sure will look for a replacement or return fee for these lights!

The lights are beautiful I bought them for my Slingshot. The day of installation my phone can't find the bluetooth link that controls the lights. It was fine yeaterday when i tried them but now NOTHING. Disappointed and will be returning them if Customer Service can't help.Update: reordered and now have 2 sets the only problem is my Bluetooth is only controlling 1 set of the lights and can't download the same app. Anyone knows how to control 2 sets on 1 Bluetooth.

I last purchased this item on August 19, 2020 and I just noticed one of the small strips are split in half.  Is it possible to have another shipped

Robert Johnson,5.0,2020 12 September,"
awesome product and even better customer service! installed it and loved it but one of the wires came loose and dragged on the road until it severed. they helped me out with a replacement for that strip and were super helpful. would definitely recommend!

"
Jeremy Adkins,1.0,2022 29 June,"
This product used to be completely waterproof, sealed leds with no air between, sectioned so each light was replaceable individually and no cheap white caps that lets water in. I bought a second kit to replace damaged lights on my car but it’s not compatible anymore. All the things that made it rated so highly are now gone and it’s the same kit as all the other cheap underglow lights on this website. Don’t expect it to last.

1st & foremost, this is an AMAZING LED. Love the Chasing features. My only concern is that this is my 2rd purchase. 1st one had all the light separated, able to attach, detach individually... the 2nd one, all 1 piece. Disappointed. Now I may hv to remove everything I did before & start all over again. I was hoping it was the same way, so that I could just remove the bad piece & attach a new piece. Smdh ... the only thing that comes to mind is cutting the cable to add the 1 piece I need. That means, soldering wires. UNNECESSARY.

It would be great it they all worked.. yes, it was Installed professionally on both trucks. I ordered 2 sets.. one set works fine the other 2 days later only 4 of the 6 lights work and there is not away to get ahold of anyone to get a new set.
"

"
ieesha,2.0,2021 20 September,"
Very disappointed because my lights only lasted 4 months and now will not turn on…. I have never had a problem with them before until one night i turned them off and then would not turn back on. Very dissatisfied with the customer care especially! I have messaged and emailed them multiple times and have yet to hear any response back from them. Other than that, these lights are very bright and comes with a good quality app.
"
Mason bush,5.0,2021 4 February,"
The adhesive didn’t stick too well but thankfully the brackets held on only problem was that i had to buy bigger screws to have more tension to secure the strips
"
Jake,3.0,2021 11 January,"
Overall happy with the product, tough to install and running wiring through engine to the battery and attaching to the car.  Adhesive will not hold long term.How do I get ahold of the seller to replace my left side?
"
Jett,5.0,2020 9 March,"
They were great lights for the first couple of days then after a little rain shower the left side started flickering I emailed them about it and gonna see how they approach it good lights till then, Emma got back to my email and they sent me another set of lights greatly appreciated
"
Nick,1.0,2022 10 August,"
Light kit stopped working after about a year with minimal use. Tried to reach seller to troubleshoot the item but no response to my email. They worked great for a short period of time. No idea why they quit on me.

Kaylan Fields,1.0,2021 25 June,"
I have bought 2 sets of these. The first ones worked for maybe 2 months then one side went completely out. They sent me a replacement strip and that one didn’t connect to the bluetooth receiver so I couldn’t change the color and it was stuck on white. Decided to buy a whole new set and before I put it on my car I checked and make sure everything worked right and it was fine and then when I got it on the car one strip in the back was stuck on white and the rest on one side of the car wasn’t turning on at all. I messaged them and told them I wanted a full refund but they told me that they could send a free replacement strip and I told them I don’t want a replacement strip and that I just wanted a refund and I never heard back from them. Not very happy. Don’t recommend at all.

Kaylain Moore,1.0,2021 24 November,"
I really didn’t want to leave a review for this, but I couldn’t find a way to contact the seller. These lights worked just fine and everything until I got pulled over for not realizing the left strip flashing blue and red (of ALL colors), then right after they started glitching out all around. I always keep them on the same color but they started flickering constantly which isn’t legal where I live by any means.I checked the wiring and everything is as it should be, no damage, nothing. I would prefer a replacement, but a refund worst case, mostly considering if they were going to crap out like this I could have bought cheap Walmart ones on top of the fact that I had a not so nice police officer write me a ticket for it.
"
The Mahabirs,5.0,2020 11 January,"
Extremely high quality LED kit. Both the brightest and most customizable kit i’ve ever seen. I’m extremely happy with the kit and it’s well worth the money. One request is that they upgrade the app to allow customization of your own modes and sequences, that would make this kit the absolute best!

Lights were installed by a professional for $250.  They are defective and will not turn off.  I took it back to the professional and he could not fix them. The only way to shut them off after all troubleshooting was tried was to remove them from the battery.  Now I have to pay $150 to have the defective ones removed, send them back to Amazon…. and another $250 to have new ones installed.  I’ve only had them approximately 4 months and only use them for special events.  Huge hassle that i have to pay to have them removed properly to get a replacement.

Diego Cavazos,1.0,2022 22 May,"
I must say that I'm highly disappointed. I bought these lights back in December and I didn't even install them until now, which is May and on one other strips past the first set of lights they don't work. Work. Aside from that, everything else with the product was great, I literally spent 3 or 4 hours install them. I should have checked them before I'd wasted all that time and doing it.

 Update:10/21/2021Welp, I WAS enjoying  my lights until I went to drive my car recently and it wouldn't start. The battery was very low and wouldn't kick over so I had to get a jump. 2 days later, the battery was completely drained. Nothing worked...key fob wouldn't even unlock my doors. I disconnected the lights just to see if they could have been the problem and sure enough, I haven't had an issue since. Now I have to get them taken off. It's pretty disappointing to say the least.Original Review: The lights look amazing. I had a good mechanic put them on. He zip tied em down so they aren't going anywhere. Of course, the lower the suspension, the more pronounced the glow is. But for stock height on the A7 Jetta, the lights glow beautifully.

The app does not ""see"" your lights - they don't work.  Period.  Emma with customer support did provide initial guidance on what to do to get them to work. In all fairness, the fixes were rudimentary and already done:  like uninstalling the app/ reinstalling the app.  Emma offered to ship another controller and has not done so to try and fix the issue.

They do not stand behind their product and require you to ship in your faulty strips to get any support. Better off buying from another brand. Lasted all of 24hours and already needed a replacement strip. fast forward another 12 hours and the main unit is now faulty using their install equipment (car charging plug).

Product does NOT work as advertised. Lights come on, but Bluetooth does not connect.I've purchased this product twice, two separate Bluetooth controllers, two separate connectors.

Clean solder joints, no butt connectors.Lights come on, Bluetooth never becomes visible in the app.Steer clear of this product.

"
Brian,1.0,2022 26 May,"
The first day it rained 2 led strips went out. Definitely not worth buying and not to mention they’re pretty difficult to install it took me 10 hours to install them just for them to last a week. Definitely do not recommend to anyone.

When I hooked them up two of the string of light come on Without me turning them on. Hook straight to battery and 2 of the strings come on without me turning them on with app and light up white and it won’t change of white . The others work fine

SSH,1.0,2022 4 February,"
Seemed like they would be good quality after the reviews but right off the bat the plug in part doesn't work. So after I hardwired it I was hoping it would work then but if by some miracle you get the app to connect to the lights and set your preferences, good luck connecting it again the next time. There's a reason the LED Hue app is rated so low. Not even worth all the hassle they were to install. Very disappointed.

Tia,1.0,2022 12 March,"
Loved the lights when I first got them. Then it rained and it stopped working. The adhesive came off so if you do install them use 3m tape cause that’s the only way they’re gonna stick.  Can’t get in touch with the seller and Amazon won’t refund the money so I took a giant L with these.

This product is amazing I'm not gonna lie. About it. Super easy to install. The 3m is fantastic. But I thought this was waterproof. Few car washes later (washed by hand) and my lights start bugging out. Like this isn't ok. I had some issues with the controller. They were nice enough to send me another one. But now this issue. Kinda makes me not feel confident about this. Kinda want my money back because of this. Update. Got in contact they were nice enough to send a replacement strip but after one rain storm. I get a call at 5 am from my father saying that my lights were on. I come out and see that it was. I took it off and see that it was all corroded. 2nd pic

The lights themselves aren't that difficult to install if you just plan things out where you want them beforehand. Beneath the vehicle they look nice, BUT and this is the kicker so I've been unable to connect the app to the lights to use all the settings and patterns described in the packaging. So right now I'm stuck on 1 pattern until I'm able to connect. I've tried multiple times to use the app that the package described.2 Stars until I can get something going..

James B.,2.0,2020 3 November,"
So at first, these lights were amazing. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED them. Then a strip died after 2.5 months.  I would be willing to re-write this review because of the initial satisfaction, if it was replace. But I believe that the strips should last longer than 3 months and that it may be a defect in the kit I receive.

If these were like $20 they wouldn't be too bad. I have owned several under glow kits and I can tell you now, do not get the flexible ones. Mine ripped apart and were dragging for a week until I had time to remove them. Get any that are the solid aluminum rails, they will last you years if installed properly.

2nd time purchasing this. I live these they are great brightness u can go what we color yiu want with dream effect. However this time around was a let down :( not even days later and some of the neon won’t turn off like they say on and the only way to turn them off is to pop yiur hood in screw a battery terminal and disconnect. Kinda sucks to have to do alllll that just for some underglow. Update been trying fir a month but they just don’t work waste of money

First set didn’t work so they were returned, after a little bit of a pain in the butt they got replaced. Easy to put on, good brightness control, no real downside. Good fit for my little wannabe rally car!Update. These didn’t last a year. Only one of the led bars still works at all. First problem was this winter when the back end of the one on the drivers side couldn’t be turned out within pulling the power source. Then the rear stopped working followed by the one I had in front.My search continues for a set of underglows that can survive a northern winter

Jaylen Frison,1.0,2021 7 July,"
It was easy to install which is why I’ll give it 1 star. That being said it almost caught on fire and I was forced to rip it all off to keep my car safe. I wouldn’t bother with a review if I jerry-rigged the lights myself but I did EXACTLY what the instructions said to do. I’m not sure if I got a faulty unit but just be careful about what companies you buy car accessories from. Could’ve ended badly!
"
DJ,1.0,2021 7 April,"
Im very disappointed... It was such a EXTREMELY BAD idea to wire the lights all together as 1 long divided (yet wired) 3 peice strip. I orded these lights once before and you could connect them in different ways but now that you cannot connect them at all (because they are wired) it makes it difficult to free style your light set up...SMHIn 1 picture each strip has a connection on the endOn another picture there is only 1 connector with 3 strips wired together

At first I was in love with these lights, until about three months after installing. They started off good then one day they took a crap. The strips started to get out sync with the app. I contacted the seller and they gave me a few troubleshooting tips which were all unsuccessful. I sent videos to help clarify my issues with the lights so finally the seller said they would replace the strips. I haven’t heard anything in months. I’ve tried reaching out again with no response.

This product is great. Installation was a little difficult to install, but only because I’d never wired anything before. Still, the installation instructions were easy to follow, and the lights themselves are BEAUTIFUL. Worth every penny.The only reason I’m giving this a 1 star is because the adhesion itself didn’t even last a week before it started peeling. In the picture, the adhesion is still sticking, but the LED strip fell off the adhesion. I was so disappointed given that the adhesion is a 3M strip. It fell off in the rear and fell off in the front.

Lights worked good for about 10 minutes at first try. Then later that night for about 10 minutes. The next day I try the lights and it will not pick up on my phones bluetooth list. I've re-downloaded the app and restarted phone with no luck. Left unconnected for 48 hours & reconnected system with no luck.  Not happy at all
"
Anthony M.,1.0,2021 7 July,"
After installing as directed, the lights lasted 2 days before they broke. The glue on 2 of the strips had already let go, and 5 of the provided attachment were broken. Also, because the attachments didn't fit the strips properly, they were left dangling around after the glue let go.
"
Michael Goncalves,1.0,2021 11 May,"
Lights looked and worked great for about a week. After a small rainfall left side of car didn't work. Then right side faded next day. After 4 days since the rain they stopped working altogether. I'm guessing water got between the silicone. It's a shame because I meticulously installed them to be invisible to the eye

The front section coming off the Bluetooth box has about 4 inches of cord. It’s impossible to install without a $20 extension cord. Not happy at all with this set up. Only good I’d say is it’s bright but a pain to do on a car as in their diagram.

bought these after a friend recommended the product, but he failed to mention that the LEDs on the whole right side would disconnect from the rest, not physically but electronically. so now i can only control the left side and the right side is either not on at all or it sometimes flashes white.

crystal oliver,1.0,2020 29 December,"
I couldn't even install them on my car ! The adhesive wasn't even sticky to start with it wouldn't even stick to my finger or the car the so called self tapping screws are junk and wouldn't even go into the car at all I tried using a drill bit and start the whole first and the screw just shredded.. worst purchase I've ever made!

 I love the brightness, choices of settings/colors, Easy installation process, easy to use app but at a car meet yesterday at a car meet my passenger side stopped working properly. When changing settings only one side changes, when I turn them off my passenger side stays on. (Ended up having to drive home with flickering lights and the risk of getting pulled over/ticketed) I’ve had them for 2 months and they were working perfectly with no problems. I installed them on my sisters car and hers work with no problem. I am not sure how to contact the creator for a replacement so writing a review is my only choice. Like I said they’re a great product and is still working on my sisters car but my passenger side is having a mind of its own.
"
Darryl Thomas,1.0,2022 30 June,"
I did as I was told. Checked the wires before installing. I powered them up in the box and everything worked. 3 months later warm weather finally comes around I go to install and the wires has a short after the first strip of leds. Of course past return policy now.
"
connor,4.0,2021 30 June,"
The 3m adhesive is garbage but it comes with mounts and screws so use the mount on plastics and then for the sides ziptie it and mount with screws to your frame, the brightness is vivid as ever, also the Bluetooth controller if getting constant power (wired straight to the battery) it will die very soon meaning the Bluetooth controller will stop receiving signal but they sell a replacement controller for 10 dollars other than that it's been the best kit I've ever owned

 My girlfriend bought me this for my birthday and after about 3 hours I had it all in place. The hardest part was getting under my car cause it’s so low. The adhesive tape works really well but I would recommend using the clips if you can. The app worked great and connected easily. I love the brightness of the lights and they look amazing. I did have an issue where they stopped working but randomly came back after an hour and work again. I will update if I have any more issues but so far I’ve loved my experience with them.

 I absolutely love the lights. They really were easy to install. To be safe, I actually cleaned all the areas under my car to ensure they stuck well. After installing, the lights were very bright and has so many different options on your phone with the app. I’m a car enthusiast so I go to car meets and people absolutely loved how the lights had the rainbow option and it all changed in a beautiful way. This is a very VERY good product. And the customer service is definitely great as well!

Syme - See Clear/Speak Plain,2.0,2021 18 August,"
My son bought these lights for his Subaru STI, and I agreed to help install.  He said YouTube confirmed slam dunk, sip iced tea install (I knew better).  Ridiculous nightmare routing wires and finding surfaces to attach lights.  Brackets are crap, and who wants to drill holes in the bottom of your car when you live in the salty road winters of the rust belt!  I zipped tied and cursed like a fool!  Then, the power source is supposed to be routed to the lighter?  What kind of mickey mouse setup is this?  His lighter already hosts other electronics.  Plus, the fuse panel is proper sourcing, but only after your buy a proper fuse setup etc etc.  The lights look good on day 1, but don't let you son trick you into believing the install is snap, boom, bang!
"
BlueIvy_392,1.0,2021 17 October,"
At 1st, I couldn't link up the app, then once I got the app right, half of the lights didn't work. The adhesive has the lights just falling down.

matt,2.0,2021 7 April,"

Taeshon Johnson,1.0,2021 16 February,"

"
Joshua E.,3.0,2020 7 September,"
Only had these installed for 3 days before one side broke on me. Last night the lights were perfect I took a couple of pictures for Instagram and made a YouTube video showing how well I had the wires tucked and how well the different lights looked at night. This morning I drove to work, came outside on my break to try to wire the interior lights I also ordered off here. As I approached my car I noticed wires that were very well tucked and secured hanging down loosely. I follow it and it ended at the black connector part, it was also still connected. What came loose was the wire broke out of the connector piece which led to the long led light for the side and the back. The adhesive on that side fell off as well, resulting in it hanging down. This is on the passenger side. The passenger front bumper lights still work as they are still connected to the main controller box, but now my side passenger and back bumper can’t light. I’m very upset right now, I had installed them myself and even had someone who charges 300 to install them check my installation out. I was extremely happy with the brightness of the lights and how they had the color flow, I’m just sad now looking at only side of my car lighting up. Really defeats the purpose of me having them on. If there is anyway, I would greatly appreciate it if I could have one pair of the long ones and the shorts one sent to me. I’ll remember next time to add super glue or something to the 3m tape so it won’t come apart next time. The instructions didn’t say anything about adding extra adhesive, but I’ll be sure to take that extra step next time. I would DEFINITELY give this review 5 stars if the 100% satisfaction guaranteed statement is expressed through the customer service and assisting me with my replacement.
"
Ryan Ellsworth,5.0,2020 9 December,"
Adhesion of the tape was not the best. But got some double sided Gorilla tape for under the vehicle and stuck the lights to it. Works flawless with the app and has lots of options for moving lights and combos or solid colors. So far so good. I'll update this if they end up suckin

 With the exception of the adhesive script period. These are some of the brightest underglow lights I have had. Easy to install, great shipping, the plastic brackets will come in handy when it comes to securing the lights periods but they do stick well on metal.
"
Robin Kruse,5.0,2020 28 September,"
Very easy to figure out on the install. Should include toggle switch and more mounts. I ended up using zip ties to hold front and rear in place because no where for screws for mounts. Be sure to get larger zip ties when placing your order. Over all very bright and the led are unclosed in rubber casing. Best I have seen so far. As for the adhesive I recommend sanding and wiping down with rubbing  alcohol for best results. I am very pleased.
"
Glitterest,4.0,2020 29 September,"
The only reason why I'm giving this product 4 stars is because it should have come with extra extensions cord for the underglow but other then that I am Very pleased with these lights, they are very bright and easy to install also easy to connect to bluetooth.
"
Blip,5.0,2021 14 January,"
The product itself is amazing for the price. This is my second underglow kit and so far my favorite. It is extremely bright, sticks on as good as it possibly can, and comes with connectors in between the led strip for easy replacement and installation. The product is amazing for the price but the best part is the customer service. I had a faulty led strip and they responded quickly to help me out.
"
Bo,5.0,2020 31 July,"
Way brighter than the Govee brand. And it has 120 moving effects.I can actually see this one in the evening, it doesn’t have to be completely dark like with Govee. Definitely worth double the price of Govee.

I bought these for under my Tahoe Limited along with like interior ones and all was well worth the time and money spent! These lights blow away all the others sold on Amazon or the set I had prior these! Be prepared to grab attention and asked where to get them! The pic was just a quick add and don't begin to explain how badass these lights are once lit the 1st time! Buy now if debating and you'll be happy!

Bought this for the interior of my outdoor/camping/off road vehicle, it definitely did what I was hoping it would! Installation was easy, everything stuck in place with the help of the silicone brackets. Not to mention it's super easy to use with the app control on your phone. Lights can be dim or super bright depending on the situation. I highly recommend!
"
Tim,5.0,2022 24 April,"
Loved that the front and rear come in 2 pieces. It fills up the whole section. The sides are long too. I was afraid they were going to be short and look funny like I see on other cars but they are not. They are very bright. Bluetooth works perfect. 120 different color sequences. Adhesion is very good but use the clips or zip ties to make sure they are secure. Very happy with this kit.

 I am extremely happy my KORJO underflow lights.  They were not only easy to install and look amazing....  but the customer service is out of this world!  There were some initial defects once I installed (ehh..  it happens with electronics)...  but I sent an email late in the evening and was thinking it would be forever before I got a response.  NOPE!!!  5 minutes later I got a response and had a replacement shipped....  Fantastic! Fantastic! Fantastic!  If you are not getting your lights here..  you are making a mistake.  Great deal, Great value, Awesome lights, & Amazing customer service!!!!  WOW!!!  Just WOW!!!  Thank you!!!

Logan C.,5.0,2022 5 July,"
I recently bought my first car and wanted to add some under-glow, saw these were the number one on Amazon so I went with them. I will admit it looks very intimidating at first. So many wires and clutter but don't let this fool you it's incredibly straight forward. Took me about a day but after I was done I was so happy with how it came out. I am not experienced enough to wire it directly with the car so I opted for the 12 volt connector. I also ended up using a 4 pronged led switch as well to help me easily switch the lights on and off and it was incredibly easy to do as well. I seriously recommend this as well! And don't be fooled, you don't really need to jack the car up, it might be harder but don't let that stop you from trying.

Loved the color of the lights, took it out riding and the connection pieces snapped off. Wouldn’t mind paying for another set or replace the connection pieces.

So basically spend 5 hours waiting for installing, turned it on , it worked for 5 minutes and than one side stop working , was disappointed and now scared to buy any of that online. So gotta spend 450 on a new one :)

Updated review. This kit WAS awesome, then it stopped connecting to bluetooth after 3 months. I'm a professional, so I know it's installed perfectly. Bought another kit, and it only connects for 60seconds, then disconnects.  Downloaded app on a different phone, same issue. So disappointed! I'm not going to buy a 3rd kit. I'll look elsewhere.

Find another product. Had these on not even a week and one side already went out. My buddy has the same lights and same side went out. Sometimes they work sometimes they don’t. Will be taking off and throwing right in the trash where this belongs.

Krisna,5.0,2021 5 November,"
Ended up installing this product myself and was very pleased about the outcome. The lights are bright and having the 120 options of different light patterns which was exactly what I was looking for. The lights are eye catching and everyone asks me what kit it was and I’m happy to say Korjo. I have not had the best luck because my LED strip has been hit by something to cause them to not work but I emailed the company and was directed to an employee named Emma. Emma has literally been helping me out with timely emails and giving me a lot of respect and understanding. She was able to communicate with me about what happened and then sent out a replacement LED strip within a couple of days. Emma has been very nice to me and is the person you want to talk to if you need help!

Brian Hardaway,5.0,2021 23 July,"

 I had bought 2 different sets before these for way more expensive and not even close to being as good as these!!! I recommend these to everyone who asked about them and I always get alot of positive attention with these on. Also it's hard not to drive every night with them on. When cruising with my cousin who also has of set of these on his car, I guarantee you we remind people of the fast n the furious when we're rolling by. Copp these while you can, best price too!

The installation is a bit difficult, if it is just a problem of installation, it is not a big problem. After I use it for 9 days, the light will not turn on. Press red, it will come out blue, press blue, it will come out red, and then it will not come out. worked, I don't recommend it

Amazing product, entertaining as well. Worked amazing and was extremely bright, many fantastic functions specially pared with interior lights. Start up early this morning 30 days later.  showed driver side was very dim compared to the other side come this evening they are starting to flicker.Update: found fault at solder. Repairs it and it's working amazing. I can't express the excitement something so silly can bring. Young and old love the lights.

 These lights are super easy to Install. You may need to do some research on how to run the cables. For my 5th gen camaro I ran the through the back seat into the truck. I placed the Bluetooth sensor in the trunk and worked my way from the back up around the wheels. There is a whole in the botoom of the trunk that lined up witg the center of the bumper. I zipetied the exercise cable to the under side of the wheel wells. Took me about a hour and a half. Be sure to clean your surface really good before attaching the tape side of the lights. Other then that really great product ans awesome results when installed correctly.

 These are fantastic for the price! They’re very bright. I keep mine at half brightness which is plenty! It has so many different colors and pre-set combinations. It’s very simple to wire up. If you can’t do that, you can plug the adapter into your car’s cig charger.The LED strips have a 3m-like-strip on the backside for installation. Once they’re stuck, you have about 4 brackets per strip as a second safety precaution. Luckily the brackets fit over like a glove.6 of the LED lights in one strip stayed on when I turned them off with the app. I could have easily returned the kit for a new one with no issues. Instead I wired a switch to my battery to cut power so they’d turn off. That was easier than uninstalling the kit.I couldn’t recommend this kit enough!P.S.In the picture/video I provided, there are lights in the wheel wells. Those are not apart of this kit.

Got mine in today, was installing it and it worked for an hour or so while I was installing it but I put it on white to finish it up and I go in the app to shut them off and. Nothing. The app completely stopped working so now not only are they stuck on solid white but I have to disconnect them from the fuse/ ground to shut them off.Update, I found that there is an issue between the connection from the harness to the lights but I emailed them and the customer service was very friendly and quickly offered to send a new harness with a control box. Hopefully it resolves the issue so I can be a true ricer

Theron Wesanko,4.0,2021 15 February,"
After receiving my lights I didn’t know I had to buy hardware for it because I knew the thin 3m adhesive wouldn’t work. I spent $15 in hardware so I couldn’t mount the lights to later finding out this product was supposed to come with mounting clips but I did not receive them in mine. Otherwise they are nice and bright.

So the adhesive strip was a joke I recommend using 3M tape to secure the strip while installing the clips and screws it comes with! So unfortunately this product broke on me with in the first week of owning it. I scraped on something and the complete right side no longer works.! Having said this while it did work it was pretty dope definitely turned some heads

 Everything was working fine until i washed my car And literally as soon as I dried my car off and got the the car meet i was going to i Tried cutting them on and my lights wouldn’t even pop up on the app and this is the 3rd pair this year ive had to order for my car i dont know why i don’t know what’s going on v but its weird to me because i only ordered 1 pair for my other car and i had them for almost 2 years now i was also wondering if i could use the 1  year warranty to get a new pair because it really didn’t make sense to me on why this keep happening

Within 24 hours of installing both side strips fell off and drug under my car on the interstate ruining it. It was a good product until this and I’m unable to get in contact with the seller for a replacement. I will change my review if they are able to provide me with a new unit. Until then I am very dissatisfied.Update they shipped me a new set almost immediately which I have already put on and looks great! I believe my first attempt was my error as I didn't use the clips they had sent. This round with the clips I doubt these strips could come off if I tried! Very good seller would buy again.

 Let me start this review off with a little backstory, This is my third LED underglow strip for my car, I have had two break on me; one broke with the wire snapping before an LED strip and the second with water getting in one of the led strips on the side. Let's just say I am very careful with buying my third LED strip. And I am quite experienced on installing them.Pros:- Very bright- More coverage (looks more full)- More customization (lots of LED options)- App is user friendly- 3M is holding very well (20 car washes and some snow and rain)- Seems to be water proof. (More on that ↓)- Multiple options of install (Just the stick, or screwing in it)This is the thing I will get compliments on constantly when I have them on and at night, at car shows etc... So far this is the best LED strip I've had for my car, with that being said I have only had it for about a month. My last two broke within the first and second month I will be leaving another review in 3 months explaining if they lasted or not and how they are doing. Now to kind of touch up on the waterproof aspect of these lights, I DID COVER EACH END OF THE LED STRIPS IN HOT GLUE TO PROTECT IT FROM WATER I RECOMMEND YOU DO THIS TOO. They say these are waterproof and I believe them but for an extra measure I added a little hot glue where each wire connects to an LED strip, and I feel it needed it. As for wiring, I chose to connect it straight to the battery and fuse I did not do the 12-volt cigarette lighter option because then you would have to go through the firewall. And I'm lazy. The wiring is very simple and the box has a pretty large range to connect to my phone's Bluetooth.Cons:- Pretty hard to install- Make sure you have places for the lights to go on your car.Granted one of the cons is because my car doesn't have a place on the rear fender for me to put the LED strip without it touching my exhaust. But I feel that this is an issue that a lot of cars will have, I ended up using zip ties and hanging them a little bit further up near the bottom of my trunk, But because the LEDs are so bright you can still see them and it worked out fine. As for the fact that it's hard to install, I've installed three, and this one was probably the hardest, But it was partly because I also wanted to make sure that they are going to last, routing them through the wheel wells under each plastic under belly pan and crevice I could possibly put the wire through. (If this is your first one and you are going to be installing it make sure you do not put it near any differential or axle or moving part of a cars suspension, springs etc) I strongly believe that depending on how you install them is how long they will last, I installed these pretty good hopefully they will last. A word of advice, TAKE YOUR TIME, DO THINGS RIGHT.... It took me almost 4 hours, But at least I know they're in there and not going anywhere. But it wasn't easy to say the least. I will be putting pictures up of the wires routed in the LEDs in a bit. As well as some nice pictures of my car with the LEDs on.AFTER TWO MONTHS:OK here it is, left side broke,  All of the led's including front middle rear did break, There was a few led's that's still seem to light up but they would stay lit even if I shut them off with the app.Now luckily for me and any other buyer they have amazing customer service, After contacting these people with the issue and sending them a picture of the issue they immediately sent a brand new replacement of all of the undergo lights.This is amazing, Not only will I be able to replace the ones that broke but now if another few break I'm going to have a full replacement strip for that side, It is a pain that I have to reinstall them but at least they sent me a new set and were not a pain. Hence why my 5 star review still stands.  I will  Install the new left led strip and give a 5 mounth review.Cool, so it's been a while, and they held up, I think this is a permanent solution for my lights problem, I took some pics and will attach them, I hope this review helped you decide.

 Let's get to it!! The install was a little tricky only because the installation may be dependent on the type of car you have. You either have to connect the hot wire to a fog light or head light fuse and the ground to the ground terminal on the battery. For me, my fog light fuse is connected to the ecu, so that was definitely a no go. The other option was to connect to through the lighter port and that's how I got it. I ran the wires under the car, then under the hood betwixt the battery, removed the rubber gasket that houses the wires inside the car, and ran the wires inside..got em connected and voila! The adhesive is ok, my suggestion is that you get your own or you can use the rubber brackets and screws. I've washed my car 3 times and driven it in rain and the adhesive held up pretty good. I fouled down on the adhesive..I'm happy with it!!!!

This is my second set in 4 months do to a car accident, my first set I loved because there were connectors between every light. It made installation a breeze on top of if 1 section was damaged you could buy a set and only have to change that 1 section. Just received my 2nd set and they are built different then the 1st set. The only disconnects are when you connect it to the power box, the lights on each side of the car are now long wires between all with no disconnect. I’m highly disappointed and am thinking of returning them to find some like my first set...

Great product but a bit tricky to put around the car. Every car is different so it’s hard to say it’s an easy install. Took me 3-4 hours to put on my Subaru BRZ since I have aftermarket side skirts and my underside was dirty so the double sided tape struggled to stay on even with me cleaning it.  The lights work really well and I love the rainbow effect I would buy again for another car if I wanted underglow. I made a video on YouTube in case anyone wants to see how they look at night and how the app works to control the lights. ( YouTube channel ZeroPlanet)

 Installation was a bit of a challenge.. You will need more 3M tape as a safety net.. Every now and again the lights will show white on the driver side now matter what color or pattern I have them set to.. Although I only typically use the red setting, there are a lot of different colorways to choose from and they are very bright.. You can even see them in the day when it's not too bright out. Love them!
"
Prince Dillian,5.0,2021 3 June,"
Hey there so I'm gonna give my complete honest opinion on these lights. First thing is they're really good, and a head turner! Me and my dad installed them under my 2017 optima in 5 hours it really did take a long time for us to get it done, but when it was done it held up perfectly, no issues whatsoever. Unfortunately the got cut and I no longer have them... I went to get a oil change and the bastards cut my light and I'm really sad because I really enjoyed the lights at night. I wish i could get them replaced or have the people who sold these to me to comment under here to help me out for this matter I literally had them for a month and lost them that fast because of a figgin oil change. Overall these lights are a must get!

 I had a defective side out of the box. The company was very quick to respond and sent replacement parts immediately. It did appear to be a fluke or it was smashed in shipping, the rest of the kit has been great. The color options are preset but there are 100 or so to choose from. The colors are bright and vivid, the whole street is lit up under my non lifted golf cart and it looks amazing. Phone connectivity has been 100% reliable too, a issue I have had with others. Very happy customer.

 me and a friend bought two kits, his $200, mine $70 (this) and this one is better and brighter (my car is the red corvette)

I love this product but I wish it had a off button on the app and wish the app had better controls
"
Amar,5.0,2021 26 May,"
This kit is really good, I don't trust any adhesive but it also came with mounting hardware which i didn't use but seems sturdy enough, I zip tied the lights along the frame and subframe. The color effects are great, you can't see the individual leds plus the chasing  effect is seamless. Don't try to cheap out on those $60 kits trust me it's not worth it!
"
Dan,5.0,2021 26 March,"
Amazing customer service!The kit is well made and very bright. 3m tape is good and brackets are supplied just in case. Lots of wires and multiple ways of connecting available. Lots of modes too. Putting them on my m3 and my tesla!
"
David Jeffress,4.0,2020 1 March,"
I had the lights installed by a auto electrian so I would recommend that. It was connected to the battery with a switch mounted under the dash near the steering wheel. The lights work really well accept that at high brightness they flicker. Now I don't use them at that brightness so it is ok. If the front lights were disconnected then the flickering stopped. Othewise good quality product.

Don't last. Had on my car for a week and already one side got water in it and now the entire right side doesn't work. Wish I would have saved my money for something that would last longer

 Kit was super easy to install.  I'm a real Buyer that spent real money (even got the extended warranty just in case)  I did the install myself and I'm not all that handy. The 3m tape would be good if my moldings were smooth and clean, unfortunately mine are not.  So ended up using the clips, which I find keep the lights straighter IMO.  Anyways, I'm very pleased with the results and think they look great!  Very bright, app was easy to set up / use.  A dramatic change for an affordable price.

 There were three lights not working properly but other than this its not bad. THE NICE THING IS THAT WHEN I ASK THE SUPPLIER THAT IF I CAN EXCHANGE IT AND GET A NEW ONE THIS SUPPLIER ACTUALLY SENT ME NEW ONE SIDE WIRING FOR FREE WHICH IS WORKING TOTALLY FINE. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCAHSE.

"
Omch,4.0,2022 12 July,"
Overall, I like the product and customer service is great!  But here’s my story:I had connectivity issues with the app at first. When I plugged it into the cig lighter the app connected without issues. Then I wired it to the battery with a switch and relay. The app didn’t work. I tried changing the fuse (started with a 15amp) and went up to 40amps and then the app came back online. It’s been 2 weeks and the app still connects so let’s see how that goes….The install is not bad but I wish there were more connectors to separate the front, middle and back strips when installing it. It would have been a lot easier like with some other brands. I also wish the led module/controller was further away from the front led strips so it could be easily mounted in the engine bay. It’s so close to the front strip that you have to almost mount it under the car. (In my case I had to extent the wire in order for it to mount in the engine bay the way I wanted it - maybe that’s why the app wouldn’t connect at first???)Other than that they look good and are bright.Would recommend to the seller to use real 3M tape. Korjo recommends their tape to be used for installing with the clips only, whiles other brands with real 3M tape say the tape is sufficient by itself to hold the strips in some areas.  But I would always use clips anyways.I ran out of mounting clips due to the excessive amount of clips that needed to be used on the strips and wires… but korjo customer service was able provide me more at no cost.  Now I have to wait for the clips to arrive (1 week) and re-Jack up the car to finish the job :/
"
dan kim,5.0,2021 3 November,"
I was quite hesitant on purchasing these lights but through the work I had to put in for the installation, it came our a lot better than I expected. They gave you a bag full of screws, zip ties and hold ons for the best protection. The 3M tape works wonders when the surface has been thoroughly cleaned. Unfortunately the 12v plug didn't work so I resorted to having to wire connectors into the fuse box which was a lot easier than it sounds. If you do purchase this item I suggest getting some inspiration by others on youtube to get you great results.
"
Jequar Campbell,1.0,2021 21 October,"
Finding power was the easy part… connecting to the app to try and find the Bluetooth connection took me more time than I thought everything would. I really wanted them hooked up so I spent 4hrs just trying to find & pair the Bluetooth… no luck & now I’m sending this crap back
"
Jason,5.0,2022 27 September,"
The lights are bright. Very straight forward install. The tape attached to the light strips is NOT meant to hold the lights on forever, it’s just meant to assist you while using the supplied clips to attach to the underside of your car

Justin Maloney,1.0,2022 11 July,"
Very good coverage, liked how it comes with 6 strips instead of the usual 4. No issues with wire length for placement and the mounting hardware is perfect, gives you piece of mind they won't randomly fall off as the adhesive is just to help with placement, not for long term use which is why they provide the proper hardware.Only issue is, it is one continuous wire with no connections. If you have to remove front or rear bumper the lights will have to be removed. I ordered the same waterproof connectors to solder in at the front and back so I can easily remove my bumper if needed.App is very easy to use and running power is easy if you have a test light to find switch power.5 star rating if they added more connections. Any car person will be removing their bumper at some point whether it is for repairs, ease of access or maybe you're too low and can't get your alignment without taking the bumper off to get on their lift. In any case, you will wish there was a connector to help with this process when the time comes.EDIT:One side of the vehicle has issues. The lights either won't work or if they start working the lights flicker and unable to hold a solid color. I only drive this vehicle in sunny weather and it the summer. Surprised they failed so quickly.

I have no way to of contacting ypu guys other then leaving a review. So once we can resolve this issue I will remove it and change it toA positive one.  So I bought two sets and only one of them work properly. I installed one one my truck and another on the girlfriends mustang. On her it doesn’t work properly. I have added a picture. The one rear section doesn’t change colour properly. It flickers and also stays mostly white.
"
Kevin,1.0,2022 20 June,"
The rear lights are now staying on 2 weeks after intall, they wont shut off and my son got pulled over by the cops and got a fine because they turned on during driving at night by themselves. I cant figure out how to contact seller as there should be warranty.... pretty pissed offSOOO the company sent me a new set of lights to fix up my boys car, he was pretty pumped. Put new set on, and within 3 months a set was toast again. No damage noticed, no wiring issue, nothing outta the norm can be seen. I will purchase a better set of lights and toss these in the garbage I guess.

jamie l,5.0,2021 14 August,"
Very happy with my purchase!I am 22, this took me maybe 3 hours to install with no tools honestly. It was so easy, the led strips are a perfect length, the wire fit nicely in the wheel well, I didn't have to take any covers off, and all wires are hidden! Connected the wires to the fuse box and battery. Bluetooth connect works well, I can have the lights on then connect to my cars Bluetooth to play music if I please. 120 options are very cool though lot seem very similar. App is easy to use as well. **My city had 2 days of rain a week after I installed them, left work driving home in streets flooded (so the entire under side of the car was exposed to water) and they stayed on right where I put them and still light up extremely bright**Definitely recommended!!
"
Sg,3.0,2022 13 October,"
I liked the sunglasses. But they arrived with one of the arms bent. I was using these sunglasses for an upcoming destination wedding and didn’t have time to return them. I was able to warm/heat the arm and hinge a little to make it more pliable to bend back in the correct position. They worked out fine but disappointed that the sunglasses were damaged before I got to utilize them. The seller really should consider sending a better durable case for sunglasses. It came with a pouch(soft) in a bubble envelope. Should be mailed in a hard plastic sunglass case or soy more durable to protect the sunglasses.

"
Judy,3.0,2020 20 October,"
These glasses are pretty much as advertised with one exception -- the lenses are far darker than what's shown in the product information.  The ""blue"" is dark navy blue, not sky blue, and I had to really look for the peach tone at the bottom of the lenses.  I bought them for a little pastel tint to wear indoors for comfort after eye surgery, and these are full-on sunglasses, dark gradient lenses.
"
C. Thomas,2.0,2020 19 April,"
These sunnies are super cheap. Not inexpensive, but cheap. They would get 5 starts if I had purchased them at a gas station for 12 bucks. At more than triple the price they barely deserve 2 stars. If stores were open and I could get sunglasses somewhere else I would send these back in a heartbeat.Pros-can’t tell the poor quality from afar (no one will be able to tell you’re wearing junk)-blocks sun-comes with a caseCons-brassy, so cheap looking up close-flimsy and light. In less than a week of gentle wear, they feel loose and will not likely hold their shape (think wobbly arms)-poor grading on the lenses, way too dark at the high midpoint where you will be looking through them. The lovely rose tint is at the very bottom-not even a hint of scratch resistance-the price is laughable100% not worth even half the price.

Honestly, they aren’t that bad, but I feel like I could have bought the same pair from Target or a gas station. For the price, these sunglasses suck. They’re cheap and get stuck in my hair. I guess one pro is that I’ve dropped them a lot and they haven’t gotten scratched!

The first pair that I ordered was scratched on both lenses. I did a return and was sent a second pair. The second pair broke within two days. The screw kept coming out and when I would put it back in, the screw was stripped and wouldn’t ever tighten. I threw them out and won’t reorder. I’ve purchased these sunglasses from Belk years ago and they were wonderful. My guess is these are knock offs. Jessica Simpson products aren’t expensive so that makes it even worse

They have completely different lenses then the ones shown in the picture and as this is why my wife picked them out is because she loved the lenses that were shown in the picture so if you want some glasses with some ugly brown lenses and that my wife said were literally worse then the $7 ones she got at jc Penny's than these are the ones for you otherwise I'd recommend not getting these.

Rebecca Stephens,1.0,2021 29 September,"
Do not buy these.  They are terrible.  They quality of the materials they're made out of is junk.  They lost their shape in less than a week.  I take care of my sun glasses.  Normally, I buy expensive pairs.  This time I thought I'd try something new.  NOT worth it.  These are not worth a dime.

These look nice but are heavy, clunky and much bigger than I thought they’d be. And the ear pieces are long and hurt my head.

I'm really picky about sunglasses and these are the only ones I've been wearing for years so I just reorder it on Amazon every so often when it gets scratched up. I just ordered a new pair recently and it was all bent I couldn't even wear them so I had to throw them away.

These are not colored as pictures, they are just dark gray, very disappointing. They are also small compared to the description. I had ordered other pairs for a variety but I canceled after seeing that these are nothing special at all. The $10 sunglasses I got from Walmart are better than these.

Michelle Rickett,1.0,2020 29 April,"
The product was nothing like the photo. The photo showed colored lenses (which is what I was looking for) what I received was very plain black lenses and feels very cheaply made. Im now stuck with these because it will cost me money out of pocket to return. What a joke! This is the first negative review I've ever left, that's how disappointed I am in this product as well as the improper representation. I paid a little more than I had planned but got way less! I'm only giving 1 star because the shipping was fairly quick.

One of the arms became loose after about a month of use, causing the glasses to not sit properly on my face and flop around if I bent over while wearing them.  Look nice, but need better quality control.

Rory Lyons,1.0,2020 29 December,"
Hinges were busted and creaked when you opened them. One arm came out past center, the other was bent.They really should have been priced at half of what they were, based on build quality alone. These are $15 sunglasses, max.Jessica Simpson’s acting career has fared better than these sunglasses did.

Betty Usher,1.0,2020 1 June,"
I had a problem with the first pair of these that I ordered and returned it.  Now I am having the same issue with the 2nd. pair that a lens easily falls out and I can't get it back into place.  Now I have just missed the return date on this pair by one day and I am very unhappy with this product.

Showed up from Amazon in an envelope. Sunglasses are all bent out of shape right out of the cheap silver case they sat in. I’m afraid to adjust them to actually wear them as they’ll most likely break upon adjustment. Will definitely be sending them back. Don’t waste your money, nothing special for the asking price.

DJ,5.0,2022 1 October,"
[Ordered this 2 years ago.]For the price, this case has held up extremely well. The way everything is made allows for little to no dust buildup, and to clean everything was fairly simple as removing just 2 major parts. Biggest issue is the front panel not coming off easily which is my biggest complaint due to dust being on the fans, but it's fairly easy to clean up from the inside.
"
Michelle Welch,5.0,2022 8 October,"
Can't say enough about this case. Has tons of room for alot of stuff. Everything is solid. Great metals used. Firm. No bending.One of the few cases that can fit a GPU up to 410mm long.
"
Finger,5.0,2022 27 September,"
This is the second PC build I’ve done running a z590e rog strix and a i9 11900k with a ml 240 aio. And the temps stay around 65C if I push it I’ll only hit 73C. So for the price and your cooling combo, this case is worth consideration. Also RGB looks pretty cool inside and out with this.
"
Bryan C. Sanders,5.0,2022 16 August,"
This case is big. But it's the truth! Cooler Masters really lives up to their name with this one ""cool."" It looks cool, keeps the components cool, and I'm cool with that. See what I did there? But in all seriousness, it was very easy to build in and I love the way my build is white and black and the RGB makes it all the more better. This is a great case. I just wish they gave 16 rubber and 16 metal screw SSD/2.5 HDD mounting combos instead of just 8. You have four mounting points two up front and two in the back you have to make a choice which two vs. including enough for all four. Trying to find an additonal eight is a nightmare. But I'll live with it I guess.
"
Austin  bx,4.0,2022 5 October,"
NICE SOLID CASE ARGB  IS BEAUTIFUL  BUT NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR  CABLE MANAGEMENT  IN THE BACK OF CASE THE CASE CAN FIT A 360 AIO ON TOP IT A TIGHT SQUEEZE  BETWEEN  THE RAM  AND EXHAUST  FAN IN THE BACK  AND WIRE AT THE TOP MAKES IT VERY TIGHT.
"
Donald,5.0,2022 27 August,"
Was looking specifically for a white case to match the decor so that my son should learn to build his first gaming PC. Tons of room, numerous cable management anchors, and ability to mount fans on the front and/or top.Polygonal mesh design looks nice as well.When snapping the front back on, be sure to tape the power button flush with the fascia so that it fits atop the power switch beneath it.
"
Omar Tanguma,4.0,2022 20 May,"
My last case from a seven year old build was a Cooler Master HAF model which was also a mid tower but a complete beast of a case. This  current case is about the same price but you definitely don't get as much from a case as you once did. I'm sure the added cost is the RGB fans. Unboxing it felt a little flimsy but I like the front panel design. Once assembled it is gladly much more rigid. It is definitely a smaller case than what I'm used to and space is a little limited so keep in mind if you need extra expansion space like sound cards. or extra USB cards. The cord management bay is also a little tight but workable. I like the power supply shroud which can be used as a shelf to customize your build with miniature figures or whatever people decorate their PC with these days.The PS shroud also has mounting holes for SSD drives or they can be mounted hidden at cable management bay too.The glass is heavy and feels robust, the fans are quiet. I wish it included a rear 120 mm fan, but I added one back there, and added three 120 mm fans on the top panel using the various slots.All in all, it is a good looking case from a reputable brand that is better suited for a no-frills type of build. Internal volume is the only con here so far.
"
Jonah Hatt,5.0,2022 12 September,"
I was worried about getting a case that feels cheap or bends easily when searching for my first PC build. This case is excellent and feels very quality. I would highly recommend this case.
"
Hank,4.0,2022 3 September,"
it's a great tower and looks amazing.  But, the fan splitter that came with the case had one of the leads dead.  I had to use a separate splitter in order to get all three of the front fans to work correctly.

Sana Benigno,4.0,2021 16 March,"
I wanted to get a white mid ATX tower to frame my PC build - my goal was to build a PC for a blend of work and mid-tier AAA gaming and this case fit the bill, esp when I bought it, the price was still right at $99.Here's my current setup:AMD Ryzen5 5600x (65W TDP)Zotac RTX3060 12GB TwinEdge OC GPU (170W TDP)G.Skillz TridentZ 2x8GB RAM 3200 MHz CL16MSI B550 Carbon Gaming Wifi MoBoWD Black SN750 500GB NVMe M.2 SSDEnermax AQUAfusion 240 AIO liquid coolerThermaltake 550W Bronze 80+ PSUCoolerMaster TD500 mid-ATX case24"" Lenovo QHD 1440p 75MHz LED monitorThe ATX case had to be white because IMHO, a white case reflects light better if you have components with aRGB LED lighting. I didn't want to use a whole lot of power, so my goal was a decent mid-tier rig that was energy efficient with a 550W PSU - so I wanted to go with the newest low TDP AMD CPU, the Ryzen 5 5600x with a GeForce RTX 3060 12GB GPU.Pros:1) The overall look of the case - white and the 3 stock aRGB fans that work seamlessly with MSI Mystic Light.2) The tinted tempered glass with the fractal edges is nice to look at.3) There is room to install a 2-fan 240mm AIO water-cooler on top.4) The magnetic flexible grille on the top is a nice touch.5) Two front USB 3.0 connectors.6) Already has three aRGB fans in the case! The stock fans are quiet and connected with my MSI mobo seamlessly and I control all three on three dedicated fan headers with smart variable fan speed based on CPU core temps.7) When gaming, I am able to maintain 56-57C CPU (steady state) core temp (haven't tried PBO2 overclock/undervolting yet) with slight GPU manual overclock 1950~2000Mhz on the RTX 3060 GPU @65 C max. This is with running the AIO water pump at 58% max speed with smart control at around 2000 RPM (max is 3400 RPM) and the radiator fans on smart PWM control. Standby mode is around 35C.Cons:1) I wish the front USB 3.0 cable connector was longer so it could be hidden better - to me it's a bit of an eyesore that this thick cable sits on top of the PSU bump-out and does a big U-turn to connect to the mobo.2) Two of the stock fans are screwed in, but the third fan on the bottom is plastic-welded in...what's up with that? Kinda sucks if you are looking to reposition fans.3) The dust filter for the PSU fan inlet at the bottom of the case is very flimsy and is easily knocked off if you are careless.4) It doesn't have a front USB-c connector.5) Part of it was my carelessness, but two of the PSU mount holes may have been slightly off-center which caused me to strip two screw holes for the PSU - oh well.
"
Jay Rocca,5.0,2022 10 August,"
Literally switched from a smaller case to this mid sized tower.It has a good amount of airflow, not too bulky, I put an rtx 3080ti in it, and there's still a lot of space at the front.The only thing that would make this even better is if there was bit more space for cable management, but then again, its not as if i took my time with the back panel cable management.
"
C. Okamuro,4.0,2020 17 July,"
I had an old Cooler Master Centurion 690 that I tried to re-use in a newer build.  The system consists of an X570 board, a 3900X, a GTX1080, and a GTX2060 Super.  Since it's a production box mainly used for compute, it's frequently at 100%, drawing 500 watts.  While the old Centurion technically worked, it needed too many fans (and made too much noise) to be practical.  The search was on for a newer high airflow case!  While I wanted to get a Phanteks case, I decided on the Cooler Master MasterBox TD500 Mesh Black ARGB (MCB-D500D-KGNN-S01) instead.  It came down to looks (subjective) and price.The TD500 arrived in a pretty beefy box, with no shipping damage.  I got my first good look at the front panel as I unboxed the case.  Well, if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I hope Fractal Design is REALLY flattered!  It's a pretty blatant copy, only marred by the ""Cooler Master"" badging (but, hey, it's their product).  The bezel on the front panel doesn't look nearly as nice as the mesh (which looks great).  The inner frame is pretty nice, staying out of the way for anything you want to do.  Sure, that's so you can pack the thing with exotic radiators and fans, but that's for a future build.  For THIS build, the PSU tucked neatly into the bottom tunnel.  The 8-pin was easy to route, EVEN WITH the motherboard in place.  The PCIe 6/8-pin power cables and 24-pin motherboard power connector route through the passthrough gaskets well.  The case jumpers come through the PSU tunnel passthroughs.  I found cable management to be pretty easy, even without a modular power supply.  The only bad thing, really, is the lack of gather points on the back side of the motherboard tray.  I don't really care about that, though.  You can see what the configuration looks like in my attached photos.  The beveled glass is a neat touch, but it's not really my style (although YMMV).  The worst case feature, from a practical standpoint, is the use of pins to mount the bottom front fan, though I guess they did that for clearance reasons.My main goal was to drop my component temps and noise level.  The TD500 did both quite well, without breaking the bank.  Excellent.  Eventually, I'll stick a massive radiator on the front and some fans on the top.  In the meantime, I'm still happy with my choice.  Recommended

This case was the easiest I've ever worked with. This case is on the larger side when many people want a tiny case. I have cerebral palsy so when building my PC I want room enough to eliminate the need for fine finger dexterity. Also this is a great case to teach PC building to someone with huge fingers the size of sausage links like my fatboy brother.The PC comes with 3 RGB fans preinstalled. The case has a space for a rear facing fan that I highly recommend you get to maximize airflow. Your GPU and CPU temps will love you for it. This PC has an interesting faceted front and glass window that add to the look of any PC you build here. There is ample space front and back, pass through's for efficient cable management if that is your thing. Or not!There is ample room for a healthy sized power supply and a standard ATX motherboard. The standoffs are already installed getting rid of that hassle. Ventilation in this case is extremely good. The power controls and USB's are ample and well designed. This case is a cut above most cheap cases so it is worth its slight premium price point. This is a basic or base line well built quality case. this case earns my 5 star rating.

I haven't upgraded my own case in about 6 years. It was about time, as I was upgrading my PC parts, and this really was the only case that STUCK out. That fractal design on the front and tempered glass look super nice, and a lot of reviews looked splendid.I honestly avoided most RGB cases, I didn't want to be all ""Flashy"" and have that ""Epic Gamer"" set up, I enjoyed my 2 separate fans up front, that just worked. no set up. but this case made setting up RGB on the reset switch on the front panel super easy. Plenty of different Motherboard adapters for the RGB controller as well, which come nicely labeled. Everything was already plugged in and set up to run off an adapter so I only needed to plug a single fan header in. SUPER convenient, as I was building 3 PC's that night, that was a total time saver, along with that adapter being labeled so neatly.This case was off to great start, It was super easy to work with, had everything I needed set up pretty much out of the box, and it looked pretty sick.I did have to look up a review online to see how to mount my SSD, as the case only came with screws and zip-ties, no manual, unless I missed it somewhere...But that's really minimal.The whole design is very sleek, and the inside is VERY spacious, My current parts a bit big, they took up most of my old case, as I have a asus ROG GTX 1080 ( 3 fans on this GPU, so she's a loooong boi) and I also have a Nocture D15S to cool my CPU, and that's a pretty sizable cooler, but it fits perfectly in this case, I still have plenty of wiggle room, if that's any idea of how much room you might have. I still have space in there.Plenty of spots for cable management with Zip-ties, or twist ties, whatever you use. Honestly really cleans up well back there.The air flow is TOP notch, with those 3 fans in the front, they do a really good job, my PC breathes VERY well with this case,  as there's just a lot of air flow.Honestly, the whole case felt very catered to my needs.Glad I purchased, and I hope if you buy, you feel the same! It's a really great case!Thanks Cooler Master!

PROs:-Looks-Mesh front panel-Separate power supply bay-Lots of cable pass-throughs and grommets-Enough hardware included-Price vs similar designs-3x 120mm RGB + controller included-Felt sturdy and solid throughout for 'budget' case-Great cooling options-2 mounting options for up to 360mm radiator, could accommodate a 240mm + a 360mm at same time-will hold a long graphics card (9"" 2-fan pictured)CONS:-Only 2 front USB-HDD cage screwed and riveted - needs to be removable-SSD mounting grommet + pin is neat idea, but in practice cables make SSD pop out of place-Right/bottom side not nearly deep enough for cable management.  It's a real struggle requiring a 3rd or 4th hand to get the metal panel on properly.-PSU filter is clipped on junk & should be same magnet design topOVERALL: I'm happy and will call it 5* because of the features, looks, and price.  Was a pretty easy build but i used a semi-modular Seasonic 650W PSU that isn't very deep.  That left me a little room behind PSU for cable tucking and I only needed 1 modular run from it.  So getting everything installed and all the parts you can see prettied up wasn't difficult.  I like the offset channel top which made mounting the 360mm rad up top real easy too.  I experienced none of the issues I saw frequently in reviews like shipping damage or missing hardware.Biggest gripe/difficulty was the cable management.  Case gives great options to make the area you can see pretty.  Horrible options to hide/route/manage what you want hidden.  The permanently fixed HDD cage ""wall"" prevents excess PSU cables getting tucked there.  The overall cavity for dressing/tucking unused length of wire is very, very shallow and even the most minimal of cable runs and SSD connectors is pushing the back/right side of case making it difficult to close or easy to accidentally disconnect something like a RGB fan 3pin connection.  I used braided white extensions & combs just to look pretty.  But that meant I was in effect managing every bit of the PSU cables behind mobo tray and there simply isn't room to do that well.  About an inch deeper on the right side for routing cables would be perfect.  Usable as-is (obviously) but if you took both side panels off my build, you'd look at one side and say ""wow, how neatly built"" then look at the other side and say ""what happened?""

Kristofer Foster,4.0,2020 27 June,"
Moving to a new rig after 8 years on my current one, I wanted a few things:1) Rubber grommets for the different cords to go through and help it look clean2) Mesh front intake3) Full range of radiator supportThis case checks all of those very well for the most part. However, I use a CM ML360 rad for my Ryzen, ultimately putting the rad at the top (which is also mesh with a magnet screen over that that lays flush), but with the hoses at the back, I could not have a rear exhaust fan. No matter how low I placed the CM MF120 fan (same as come with the rad itself) it was just too thick at the top, closest to the hose. Slight bummer as I wanted the extra lights and flow. So far hasn't been an issue temperature-wise but still disappointing. Hope CM can either give a tiny bit more space in the case, height or depth wise, or even allow lower mounting points for the fan to fit at the rear, or make the rad a little less thick to allow more room.Front fans don't give that much light inside the case but still look nice thru the mesh front. Be aware the bottom fan is held in by plastic pins rather than screws and I have noticed the slightest of buzz/rattling from that (I think). NONE of them have rubber at the contact points to the case, I am getting the CM Halo white fans to replace them (not just for the rubber contact but I think they look better).Only other issue/complaint/suggestion is the PSU fan screen on the bottom is just a thin little sheet held in by a few tabs. It does not slide like other filters but is right where you want to grab the case underneath and then it falls out or could end up bent if you aren't paying attention. Would have liked to have seen a proper sliding screen like other cases have instead of a cheap solution of a mesh patch. Also, why aren't the PCI brackets in back white as well?Overall though I really like the look of this case. The grommets cover the cords well and are located at good heights. PSU shroud pass throughs are great too. Front panel looks really cool with the RGB and diamond design. Front I/O is simple and clean. Glass panel is simple yet unique and not distracting. Lot of airflow options with fans and AIO/loops. Just those couple of things with the PSU screen on the bottom, black brackets at the back, and the limited rear fan room are the only issues keeping it from a 5 star for me.

Very sturdy case. Not too heavy. Front fans stopped working after 1 week. I even put fan header on different pins on the MB. Funny thing is that the RGB stayed on even though the fans weren't spinning. It was very easy returning the case to Amazon.

I have a ryzen 9 5950x and a 3080TI in it and it runs cooler than my gtx1060 and i7 7700 build. The front is full mesh with 3 intakes and I didn’t even need to add any case fans my cpu cooler(scythe ninja 5) and the three front fans keep the whole thing icy and I have nothing to point at besides how open this case is. Excellent case and the lighting effects are gorgeous as well. Well done cooler master. You really seem to have mastered cooling
"
Chad C,3.0,2022 5 September,"
Was building a nice ARGB all white and RGB filled build, this was a reasonable case for the end product, with a couple corners cut for sure.The filter on top is garbage, it's magnetic, but the super this weak magnets are a joke as it falls off and slides. (Plus on a white case, why is it all black???)The ""filter"" on the bottom is a thin plastic mesh square. Probably 2¢ to make. But is a feature. LolThe glass is nice, but fingerprint prone.And the case itself is pretty nice, even if it's super light and I felt like I might bend it while installing components.One last thing is the basement the PSU sits in is only vented out the bottom, and is non removable without some tools.Overall it did the job, looks nice and is a good size.

 This case is absolutely gorgeous. The installation process was extremely easy. Cable management was perfect and the ARGB fans even included a controller which allowed me to plug the fans (ARGB header) to my motherboard that only provides PWM headers. So yes, as shown in video, this case works PERFECT with a motherboard only having PWM headers. I kept the 3 provided ARGB fans, installed a Vetroo V5 cpu cooler, and 2 Be Quiet! fans (one in back, one on top). The case is ridiculously quiet, granted i installed the Be Quiet! fans to balance out the provided fans. Airflow is great, no issues at all. If you like how this case looks aesthetically, there should be nothing holding you back. I could not recommend this case more. An absolutely amazing, gorgeous product.
"
Mouhamad,4.0,2022 24 June,"
The case is nice especially the mesh front. My 360mm aio just barely fit at the top, I didn't have room for the rear fan. Fair amount of room for cable management but no flat surfaces in the back to stick on my corsair commander. Good case overall
"
Jesse,5.0,2021 19 March,"
I really like the asthetics of TD500 Mesh, and while the front grille was practically stolen from Fractal, it does look good.  The default fans are decent enough and keep my 5900x around 40C at idle coupled with a Cooler Master 360 RGB water cooler.My biggest complaint about the case is the cable management behind the motherboard.  It is extremely cramped and I really wish it was 1/2 an inch deeper between the motherboard tray and the ""solid"" side panel.  If you are trying to use the included RGB controller as I did before fully rebuilding my PC (my old x99 Mobo did not have an rgb controller) you may need a 2nd person to get the side panel back on to the case.  For me it was a constant struggle, as the RGB controller forces a lot of additional wires behind the motherboard.  The side panel is much easier to put on without the hardware RGB controller installed, but it is still pretty tight.My case did not come with the exhaust fan, which I purchased separately.  It is a Cooler Master SickleFlow 120 ARGB fan, and it barely fits.  You can see in the picture that the radiator fans protrude below the exhaust fan, and the width clearance is about 1/8th in.  Thicker fans, like my old (but awesome) Deltas would not fit with on the exhaust mount with this cooler in place.While the radiator and exhaust fan are a tight squeeze, my 315mm XFX 5700xt THICC 3 Ultra fits with room to spare.Overall I do love the look of this case, and am satisfied now that it is complete.  However, the cabling behind the motherboard is cramped, and there are cases (Corsair 4000D airflows, for example) that offer more space to shove cables between the motherboard and case.  If you plan on using the RGB controller included with this case, prepare for a struggle.  If your motherboard supports it natively you will have a much easier time.

Only thing negative is the cable room for psu cables is pretty tight. If not using 3.5 inch drives you can remove the drive bays then this case its perfect wont find better for price.

SC,4.0,2020 26 August,"
I'm going to begin this review by simply stating I've dropped a star from my overall rating because of Cooler Master support.The case itself I like just fine. It's decently spacious. I was able to fit a Hyper 212 air cooler in it without issue (also CM,) which I was worried about initially because that thing is a bulky. I had read reviews previously that mentioned the side paneling wasn't actually tempered glass and/or flimsy--but that hasn't been my experience. It seems heavy, tough and I should probably remove the protective film off of it at this point (I'm the worst sometimes.)Building my PC in the case was relatively painless, and I do like the built in space towards the bottom for the PSU and HDs. All in all, I would like to review this case with five stars.However, that said, if you have any sort of ISSUE with your case--know that Cooler Master in my experience is anything but prompt in assisting.I.e. my case came with one of the three fans not lighting properly. It was spinning, so it wasn't necessarily the biggest deal, but like anyone I was hoping to get what I paid for and expected. Not wanting to tear down my entire new build because of one ARGB fan not lighting, I registered the case on CM's website and posted a support ticket to explain the situation and request if they would send me a new one.The reply didn't come until over a month later--where they agreed to do this--but simply asked for my shipping address (which, for what it's worth, was located in my CM profile and registration at that point.) Over another month later, I've now received a reply that a replacement fan has shipped (e-mail addressed to the wrong first name, but hey--as long as they've got the shipping address right...)All in all, a great case if yours arrives with no issues. I'm glad my issue was relatively minor and didn't keep me from actually using my new build. Worse comes to worse, dealing with Amazon support is probably going to be more fruitful than dealing with the manufacturer themselves, as prompt is not a word in their vocabulary.The case itself though? I like. Five stars if you get yours without issue.

Lee the Builder,4.0,2020 30 May,"
I received this case today May 30, 2020 for a build for my grandson.The cardboard outer box have a chunk damaged on one corner but the shipping Styrofoam protected the case which arrived pristine.The case is essentially complete as delivered. Separate in the box was the direction pamphlet, about two dozen sketches of various device installations and no written words. Also in the box I found both the magnetic filter that covers the case top and the small filter that covers the case bottom airway. I assume they were in place at shipping but got loose in transit. There is no fastener to hold them in place.In the case was a plastic bag. In it  a handful of black zip ties and the ARGB controller. In the bag also a couple of smaller bags of standoffs, screws and dowels etc., standard issue hardware extras.In the reviews a couple of confusing notes.It was stated that the clear side panel is acrylic. The manufacturer advertised is as crystalline glass. That is what it is. Earlier/ other versions of the TD500 do have a polymer panel, this one is etched tempered glass.A review complained that the hard drive tray was not removable. Partially true. The hard drive enclosure is also the PSU enclosure. It is riveted in place. Rivets could be defeated if a builder absolutely wanted to remove it but it looks like a structural reinforcement component of the case design. I wouldn't mess with it.On the other hand the riser that supports the trays opposite the enclosure tray support is removable by four screws. With that gone the trays come out and the enclosure becomes available for cable management or some freaky PSU arrangement. You lose 3.5 HDD trays but there's room for  SSD's elsewhere.We have not populated the case yet. My plan is to go all fans. Three came with, I bought one for exhaust on the case back, two exhaust for placement on the top,  there is a fan of course on the PSU, the GPU will provide three and the CPU will have two in push pull. Eleven fans in the enclosure hopefully arrayed to maximize flow.If noise is a problem or my grandson decides to go liquid cooling then this case offers ample room.I'll try to remember to update the review post build.

Henry,4.0,2021 20 June,"
This case came as a bundle with a CoolerMaster ML280 AIO water cooler.I bought a Gigabyte Z390 Gaming X motherboard and ran into problems with the size of the block plus fans not clearing the memory modules.  I removed the fans and mounted the block to the front panel.  Due to a raised metal stamping at the front of the case I could not mount the waterblock with the tubes at the bottom as should be proper. The raised metal kept the block from laying flat in that corner and misaligned the mounting holes.  I had to mount the block with the tubes at the top parallel to the pump which is considered non-optimal for pump longevity.Other than that this case is pretty nice.  The side panel is real tempered glass not just acrylic so be careful with that panel.  Two of the fans are mounted using the usual horribly tight fan screws that are tapped into plastic.  The last fan was held in with plastic clips that were actually good. When I moved all three fans though I had to purchase new mounting screws (or in this case I bought rubber mounts) to hold the fan to the back panel.  The plastic clips were not large enough to hold it in the pre-punched slots.Cable management is nice.  Lots of cable ties included and plenty of places to attach them.  I have a whole bag of extra ties I was given ages ago so I had plenty of spares.I like the case, but the water block plus the case were a minor headache to put together.Beware if using a waterblock to check clearance will be enough when using the block mounted to the top.

aethereal,5.0,2021 9 May,"
Overall, this case is very nice looking and has excellent airflow, and I am happy with it.However, it has one characteristic that I think everyone should know about (but many are not aware of):  It uses the ARGB standard (3-pin, 5V), not the RGB (4-pin, 12V) standard, for its fan lighting.What that means is:  If you (like me) happen to have a motherboard that supports RGB (but not ARGB), you will be unable to control your lighting effects via motherboard.  Instead, you will be limited to controlling your case fan lighting via a small physical controller device that comes with this case (that you can tuck away inside your case, or alternatively link with your reset switch so you can control it via the reset button on the front of your case).  But you will be limited to a relatively small number of lighting styles that can only be changed via physical button clicks, rather than infinitely customized via software.Interestingly, it seems that the ARGB standard is actually more modern (and flexible) than the RGB standard.  However, one should be aware that many motherboards only natively support the older RGB standard, rather than the newer ARGB standard.In case anybody is interested and has read this far:There are a very small number of ARGB-to-RGB converters (e.g., Razer and DeepCool) available on the market to resolve this compatibility problem, but they do not appear to be completely reliable and safe, so I may not use them.Alternatively, one can perhaps buy a separate controller that accepts ARGB and plugs into USB apparently.  (I'm still researching this.)However, bottom line:  For full software control of the ARGB fan lighting that comes with this case, be sure your motherboard natively supports the ARGB standard, rather than only the RGB standard.

 set up took some time but i was half awake after working a grave shift. otherwise it wouldve been a cake walk. the case is sturdy i was leary about the lines in the glass panel but its built real well. the mesh makes this thing breathe super well! i'd reccomend this to anyone who wants a good looking case thats also trying to keep they're temps under control just remember to order some extra fans as it only comes with the 3 in front. I slapped some antec P12s in there and it's definitely a happy camper

Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 6 June,"
Was nervous that I wouldn't be able to top mount my Arctic liquid freezer ii 360 AIO due to the thickness of the rad and fans. However, I was able to pretty easily top mount it with Corsair lpx RAM on my Asus z690 plus mobo. There is still only maybe ~5mm or so of clearance so I wouldn't try it with anything much taller than the lpx in this case.

Daniel,5.0,2020 16 August,"
This is an awesome case for the price. Got this to upgrade my build, I had an old, boring, smaller form factor case that I was tired of. This case is great for airflow, just look it up on youtube and a lot of videos are available where they've compared this case against others for their airflow/cooling capabilities.I removed all my parts and put them in this case. Installing everything was really easy, there is way more room in this case than a small form factor case. Only added difficulty was the additional wires for aRGB, I didn't have those in my old case. Lots of room for cable management in the back and the grommets and holes make that easier. The included RGB fans are nice, slightly whinier than my old Fractal Prisma SL-12 fans but not loud by any means. The tempered glass side is very nice, crystal clear and heavy. Mounting SSDs and HDDs is super easy, there are four spots to mount SSDs and they are simply held in place by little studs that screw in to the SSD and then you insert into rubber mounts. You can mount two HDDs in the drive bay with nifty little trays that slide in and out. If you don't have any old HDDs, you can remove the trays and the right wall of the bay and then you'll have way more room for the power supply and cables. The included ARGB controller is nice since I don't have an RGB header on my motherboard. For greater flexibility I was able to peel the reset switch cable away from the other front IO cables and plug it into the RGB controller. Now I can toggle through the 14 RGB presets by using the reset button on the front IO.

blake,5.0,2021 11 December,"
There really isn't much cons with this case. Looks nice with alot of standard options for cable management. The only issue i had(and it could have just been my case) was removing the harddrive bay. So one section is riveted on so you cant take that off, but the other section is screwed in which is removable. However it was ver very hard to get those screws off on my case for some reason. Either way i suggest you take it off if you dont plan on using standard HDD, cause it gives ALOT more room for cables.Also this fits the coolermaster ml360 mirror AIO cooler for reference. Kinda have to play with the front panel cables cause they make the 360mm radiator hard to work with but all in all wwas able to mount it on top with ease.You can also use the front panel reset switch on your controller instead so that you can control your ARGB fans by just hitting the reset button which i thought that was cool.
"
Matt,5.0,2021 9 August,"
For what you're paying this is a solid case considering you're also getting 3 argb fans along with it. Mine arrived in good shape unlike other reviews have mentioned. The case is fairly light while still feeling solidly built. The airflow of the case is great with all the mesh present on the case. It also looks great with all the lighting when running and really stands out. The design extending to the tempered glass is really cool as well and stands out from other cases with glass panels. The magnetic filter on the top is a nice touch but the PSU filter on the bottom feels like an afterthought. The ssd mounting options are clever and easy to use.The HDD cage being removable would be nice but at this price point isn't a deal breaker. The biggest downside as others have mentioned is that the cable management isn't the best. You don't have a lot of room under the PSU shroud for cable management especially if you are working with a non modular PSU. It's all still manageable and workable though and the front of the case that you can actually see looks great even if things are a bit cramped behind the scenes.Honestly this is a good case with a few small nitpicks that don't take away from the overall quality and value at this price point. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.

Joe P.,5.0,2022 12 April,"
I chose this case for the airflow. The fact that is has a very strong and beautiful glass side is fantastic.  The chance that it is white, now that is fortunate, since this was a gift for my 14 year old son.  He already has a nice white, rgb gaming keyboard, so it matches.  I have been building PCs for over 30 years so I know what I am saying when I say this.  It was easy to unpack utilize the space and plenty of fan places.  Everything fits perfect and airflow is maxed.

Keith Strickland,5.0,2020 27 August,"
This was my first home pc build so I went with a mid tower case after going through a multitude of reviews which steered me away from micro atx and landed on the Cooler Master MasterBox TD500.  Aesthetically the RBG fans are cool, and there's 3 of them which came pre-installed.  There's also interior lighting behind the motherboard which is neat.  The PSU sits at the bottom of the case with a vent and there's a mesh vent on top in addition to the opening in the rear.  I personally wanted a closed case and not open air simply b/c I fear dust so the tempered glass was ideal.  I can see everything inside and the components are completely enclosed.Given that this was my first build, I had no clue how much space I would actually need for the particular parts I ordered, but I was able to easily fit everything onto my mobo and slot it in with no issues.  Cable management was the only challenge as I struggled to route the 24-pin cable.  Other than that large bulky cable, the other connectors fit into all the available case holes to keep the cords hidden and clean with a tie.One thing I wish I had done is remove the hdd enclosure.  Now that m.2 is a thing, I would have preferred the space dedicated to the 3.5"" drives optional.  I couldn't figure out how to remove drive bays without completely taking apart the case.  Ideally, that would have freed up the entire lower portion of the case for cable management.I'll mention plenty of ports, usb 2.0, 3.2, DP, Wi-Fi, etc.  I'm digging the case and recommend.
"
CJ Adams,5.0,2020 29 October,"
My Review:As you read in the title, this case should cost way more. For the $100 price you get every creature comfort you will see on cases double the cost. It has a spacious PSU basement, removable drive trays because who needs HDDs when you can get ridiculously large M.2 drives and 2.5” drives nowadays, plenty of cable management space, and just all around next level looks. I bought this case first and foremost because it looked cool but when I fit my rig into it I was taken away by how low my temps were, my rig is running a Ryzen 7 2700x cpu and a Radeon RX5700XT gpu, all overclocked, and my temps are like 20 degrees cooler than with my other case just going off the standard air setup. This case is definitely worth the money and should be anybody’s go to when they need a quality case for an air cool build.Pros:- Great Temps- Great Looks- All The Creature Comforts- Ample Cable Management RoomCons:- Side Glass Panel is Not Tempered (the reason for this is so they can do the engraving you can see in the pictures)- Doesn’t Come With an Exhaust Fan at The BackFinal Thoughts:Overall, if the opening review or the title hasn’t hooked you then you must hate having a good PC case. This case is hands down the best case I have ever owned. I mean, it should be considered illegal to spend $200+ on PC cases when something like this exists that includes everything those cases have just with, admittedly, less of that glorious RGB.

The case has plenty of space for all your needs. With its 3 fans in the front and another one in the back (120mm) and one on top (120mm) it keeps my cpu and GPU in the low 40 degrees C. Easy to assemble with plent of options for cabling the Mobo is gigabyte and it controls the color scheme to the fans just fine.

Couple things right off the bat, the undercarriage power supply vent cover/filter is a bit flimsy, not magnetic like the top vent cover/filter.  I didn't realize this when I ordered the case, because I didn't care, but the clear side panel is legit glass which is kind of nice.  The case as a whole is fairly light which is also nice.  I had difficulties with power supply wiring once installed - there isn't much room once power supply is installed to add, remove, move cables around.  Plus tucking them around the back you run out of room pretty quick.  Not the easiest cable management I've done on a case, but manageable.Power button is a stiff button, not a soft spring press.  Reset button is very small.  Mounting a 240mm cooler on top was very easy.  I'd prefer more space from the top to the motherboard mount location, I struggled with the 240mm cooler on top to get the CPU power connectors on the board I put in this (no big deal though just do them first) but leaves you stuck if you ever have to remove them from dead power supply I will have to remove the fans from the cooler in order to remove them.  Also on the board I had, Fan connectors are also on the same side....so generally would like more space from the top to the motherboard...this would likely result in a taller case, but depends on where your trade off is.Power supply compartment is a little weird in that it's hard to show off power supply RGB regardless of how your position your power supply.

PROS:- great cooling performance- quiet fans- nice ARGB optionsCONS:- practically no cable management. very minimal space on the back of the case to route your cables and you really have to crush them in order to get the back panel on. the power cables to your 3.5"" drives are especially problematic and protrude far enough out that you have to bend them really hard to make enough room to get the panel on- the back panel is the usual terrible design that's really difficult to get on especially when your cables are going to be pushing up against them- the holes on the top for mounting a radiator of fans aren't recessed enough which causes the screws to make the removeable dust filter that lays on top sort of bulge out and not lay flat. if they made those screw holes even a millimeter or two deeper, it wouldn't be a problem- no front I/O adapter to make it easier to attach all connectors to the mobo at once. have to do each connector individually. this might be more on the manufacturer or the mobo than the case, but it'd still be a nice and inexpensive addition and make things a lot easier- no rubber grommets on the exterior. not a big deal, but would have made hot plugging drives or custom water cooling easier (or possible at all)overall this is a good case for the price point. it's just a bit cramped and might have made for a better full tower than a mid tower.

This is definitely a great case, although it doesn’t fit my motherboard, it is a little bit larger than the room for the motherboard, asus tuf z590, if u don’t want troublesome and have the same motherboard as I do, maybe switch to another case. I fixed it with a hammer and it looks great!

Mark w,4.0,2021 3 January,"
Used this case for a build with an ASROCK B550m/AC motherboard, stock AMD cpu cooler, and three additional fans besides the 3 included in the case.The glass side great - seems pretty high quality and looks really cool with various rgb effects.I’m not sure about the included fans- they were very easy to set up with my motherboard because they came preassembled and plugged into both argb and pwm splitters that I plugged into headers on the mobo. The colors are consistent and work well with ASROCK polychrome sync. However, they don’t always spin on startup and sometimes I need to blow on them or initiate a fan test to get them spinning. That said, they’re quiet and also easily controllable with my mobo software.Prior to installing my 3 additional fans, my cpu was idling at around 55-60c. Now it hangs out around that same temperature under load, highly recommend at least 1 exhaust fan.Building in the case is easy, coming from a first time pc builder such as myself. Tons of room, included zip ties and hardware, lots of options for placing internal SSDs.Only complaint - My power button on the front panel snapped off with the first press. It’s held on via its frame and two tiny plastic pegs with some kind of adhesive to the front panel. It was a super easy fix - I used some rubber cement on the pegs and it works like new.

Kit,5.0,2020 15 September,"
This was the case I choose for my first PC build and I absolutely love it so far. Mine arrived in perfect condition and I have not had any issues with the stock fans making weird noises, like other reviews have mentioned, but I'll update this if anything changes.Anyway, this thing looks amazing. Super sleek and very well-suited for an all-black gaming build. Plenty of room for more fans (I added three of CM's halo 120s) so everything has been sufficiently cool so far (idles around 35-40 and gpu runs at a cool 65 even for heavy load gaming).You can remove the slots for the hard drive bays, which is nice and helps for getting your cables in on the psu, although your best bet is hooking your psu cables up before actually installing it. With it installed, the angle was too weird and difficult to make work plugging stuff in, but again. Just doing that before screwing it in fixes that tiny issue perfectly.Also, the tempered glass (and yes, it is tempered glass if you get the cheaper mesh option on this listing) is veeeeery pretty and I love the cuts on it, really makes the rgb look even more visually interesting.I may replace the stock fans at some point but so far they do the job and they're very quiet! (Although the ambient noise is pretty loud in my house to begin with, so idk).Anyway, great case!
"
Johan,5.0,2020 15 October,"
Building in this case was absolutely no stress, there is so much room for cable management as the PSU shroud doesn't extend to the fans. The hard drive mounts (have no idea what they're called but hopefully you know what I mean) are removable as they are attached to the shroud and bottom of the case (held by 4 screws).Pros:-Spacious, using 3 NF-F12(120mm) from Noctua on the top of the case with a fair bit of wiggle room remaining. Can stick some front I/O cables that I find redundant like the USB 3.0 in the hard drive compartment.-Looks very nice although that is subjective-MB standoffs are pre mounted-Tons of cut outs for zip ties and velco straps which could be used for cable management.Cons:-Hilariously cheap PSU dust filter. I mean, a thin piece of napkin could be competition for that filter-Not a lot of fans but at this price point, you could easily find cases with up to 6 fans like the Musetex Phantom Black. This case doesn't even have an exhaust fan as you can obviously see however, most case fans pale in comparison to aftermarket case fans in terms of airflow anyway and are only there for aesthetic effects.Edit!!: There is a weird clicking noise with the front rgb fans regardless of whether or not you turn the rgb off. It isn't audible with a headset on but it's a good to know
"
Yurika,4.0,2021 9 February,"
Apparently the RGB fans that come with this case cannot be controlled by software unless you have a motheboard with ARGB 3 pins. My mobo unfortunately has JRGB 4 pins and so the only way to control the colors is via the little remote that comes with the case but sadly you can only pick from a few presets that come programmed in it (aka I wanted a solid purple/pink color but had to settle on purple/pink breathing style.)I downgraded from a really great corsair case but I just needed more space so I opted for a mid tower but design wise I really like it. The front 3 fans are quiet and if they aren't, install your motherboard's software to help control them as I have learned. I installed a back fan and installed 3 more fans to place up top for more cooling.Only other thing I hate is opening/closing the back case is very difficult if you do it while the computer's vertical. Have to basically place it on its side otherwise trying to lineup the holes with the closing panel is really annoying. Anyway I'm still happy with the case, I bought it mostly for the design/looks and to downsize from my full tower.
"
Suzanne Rogers,4.0,2020 15 September,"
Let's start with the positives:Great airflow, nice cable grommets to keep stuff clean, the fans that come with it are stellar. Easy to work with. ARGB works well, and provided splitters are handy.The small negatives: Space in back of case is big enough, but with full ARGB makes the back a squeeze once all cables are routed. Not enough screws provided for extra case fans. I've read that the front fans were all supposed to be attached with plastic bolts, but only 1 out of the 3 of them were permanently attached so that was a pleasant surprise. This is all to lead to my main gripe regarding radiators: if a radiator is top mounted with a 360mm sized radiator (and probably a 240mm) it will collide with your ram if the ram if you have a ram height of 44mm so they will not fit together. I was able to mount the rad to the front with the provided long screws in Cooler Master's 360 mm aio, but could not attach all 12 because the bottom fan was plastic bolted on. I ended up using a command strip to keep it tight near the bottom of the case, but am just peeved at the accessibility of the front fans.All said and done, it was a good build and I'm happy with the looks and 30 degree temps on my 10th gen processor.
"
Matthew Waters,5.0,2022 2 May,"
I really like this tower as it is very well thought out and looks gorgeous, but if you try to use a 360mm cooler master radiator along the top, be warned- it doesn't leave much space between your RAM and your fans if you have tall RAM sticks. It'll work, but barely.
"
Franco M.,5.0,2022 2 May,"
This is simply a great case. It looks fantastic, it has a lot of space (maybe too much if you're looking to go small), and 3 preinstalled front fans. By the way, the HDD space can be adjusted at first to adjust the power cables first which is just some genius engineering.
"
MJ,5.0,2021 14 July,"
If you're looking to put together a PC with a white color scheme, this is the case you want.The textured front mesh with the RGB fans behind it is gorgeous, and the etched pattern on the side panel window gives it a bit more personality without being tacky. I like the PSU cutout so that you can show off your high-end power supply but still hide all your messy cables. The illuminated power button in the shape of the CM logo is also a nice touch.Dust buildup in the five months I've been using this case has been minimal. It's also pretty easy to build in, though don't expect to get to anything near the top of your motherboard without removing any radiators you've top-mounted.The only real gripe I have is that the mounts for the two SSDs above the power supply are positioned such that you'll probably have a VERY tight fit for the SATA cables. It can be done, though, with some patience.Very good value for money, and high-quality materials. I can't think of a single white case on the market I'd rather have at this price point.

Well I really am impressed with the thermal performance of this case and it looks really nice with my setup. The only complaints I really have are it is a ""Dust Magnet"" be prepared to give it a good clean it at least once a month if not bi-weekly. My only other complaint is that the pre installed RGB controller only has Flashing RGB not any solid color options you can have it set to a specific color however it will fade to black and then a very bright iteration of the color of your choice. its ither that or unicorn puke so I decided to turn it off completely. I have no clue why they included this trash RGB controller even though they have a nearly perfect controller that comes with many of Cooler Master's RGB CPU coolers.

 So the case is great, has plenty of space, and plenty of airflow. The only minor flaw that I saw in the design was when installing the graphics card, the space to fit a screwdriver is very narrow that it can be easy to strip the screw. Other than that its a really good case that'll keep your pc cool.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2021 23 January,"
The case is made well, however the metal can easily be bent. Other cons incude a terrible PSU mesh filter that continuously pops off, A LOT of cables on the stock fans for power and RGB. Lastly, very limited space between the back of the case and removable side panel for cable management. I often need an extra set of hands just to attach the side panel that is pressing against my cable management. From a trusting brand, I would expect maybe a slide out filter rather than small notches that don't hold it in place.Bedsides these gripes that I've experienced the white is an amazing choice, the glass design flows nicely with the front fan panel. This thing will SUCK so much air if you did what I did and placed a 360 Corsair H150I at the top with LL 120mm fans and 3 Corsair LL 120mm fans in the front. You cannot adjust the fan speed with the stock fans and the RGB on them are sub par. This was my forst build and the case offers plenty of space and nice rubber shrouds to feed cables through. Would recommend.

Jerry R.,3.0,2022 3 June,"
I'm using this case for my first build, and I do have to say that it is beautiful. However, much to my dismay, it is *ever* so slightly short to fit a top-mounted AIO.I'm using the Cooler Master ML240L and the fans *just barely* don't clear the RAM sticks. I had to take a dremel to the fan shroud in order for the RAM to fit and be seated properly.I'm a little worries that the 1mm gap between the fan blades and the RAM isn't going to be enough. I will continue the build as normal and update this review if my modification worked.

T-H,3.0,2020 21 November,"
the Side panel was an afterthought. Not only did it stick out from the case you could see each fold and detail on the case since the panel was just simple glass no metal frame no nothing.while the Airflow was good the top mesh moves FAR too easily when picking up the case the mesh slid around as i went to tilt it back. this is with an Empty case. nothing in it. another factor to consider, why is there mesh up here?top fans and Rads should be EXHAUST ONLY heat rises and convection means heat will WANT to flow up creating its own airflow as the air expands. Exhausting air through this Point means better cooling. you are working with the natural airflow. mesh up top does what? it cant filter as this is an exit point. there is nothing to catch assuming your intake filters are working. this means this Mesh is ONLY restricting airflow for NO reason. lots of cases have fallen into this.  bottom and front should be intake Rear and top exhaust for a standard case design (there are a few Exceptions!)that being said. for an Air-cooled build. this case does ALOT right. meshed front with big intake space. Basement is Big enough to house bays. which one can remove. the case can easily fit a 35mm 360 rad in front and a 280 up topits a good case to work in for the most partFinal thoughtsthe glass panel should recess to be flush with the case end not stick out.the Mesh top should be Changed out for a more open less filtery option thats built into the case as the front fans should be doing that work anywaysthe Build quality leaves something to be desired. compared to the 4000D airflow this case feels cheep, light and Plasticky the Angled glass designs feel gimmicky.  you are mostly Paying for the Fans. Id bet of the cost $40-50 of it are in those fans.

Case works great, for being on the lower end of price. There was plenty of room to work.

Overall a very good case, easy to install, good amount of space for cable management.However, the nail on my metal plate near IO shield part popped out, so I used force to push my motherboard in there and put the stand-offs in, which could be really bad.Also the top can indeed fill 2x 140mm fans, but a 280mm radiators won’t fit because the ram spot blocks the radiator.

Jake,4.0,2021 29 March,"
I've got a 3080 packed in here and the power PCIE cables are just barely pressed up against the glass. After all the cables I need plugged in and nicely tucked in the back, putting the back plate back on was a little bit of a struggle. Overall aesthetic is very very clean, building inside was really easy. I feel the main Con is cable space in the back. If I wanted to put in Colorful power extensions I don't think Id have enough room in the back and they would have to flow into the viewable part of the case. However for a Mid-Tower.... Grade A quality airflow, comes with 3 super silent ARGB Fans that have been very effective for me in my build.Since I have a large GPU and I may upgrade to a Full Tower for just a bit more room for fun activities and possible water-cooling.Over all its a great case none the less.
"
Miguel,4.0,2020 29 October,"
love the way the case looks and feels. Top rad. support is amazing where you can push it back or forward depending on your ram clearance. Cable management is pretty good for the most par. Only complaints I have about it is that the fans rgb somehow don't work, but still spin normally. Don't know why that is, I plugged everything in troubleshot everything to see if I had done something wrong, but unfortunately the ARGB fans don't have RGB. Also, the empty space at the bottom of the case where the Psu and the hard drive cage are located I had to take the hard drive cage out because i wouldn't have had enough space for cable managment. So unfortunately I couldn't use my hard drive, but it's all good because I'm going to get ssds and M.2 ssds. As far as the stock fans I was going to replace them anyways so I guess it's a win win? Just kinda sucks that the stock fans didn't have functioning RGB.
"
Amazon Customer,2.0,2022 21 February,"
The 3.5"" drive cage is too close to the power supply mounting spot, it is difficult to get either power supply that I have to put in there installed without removing it. I will be cutting the rivets that mount the drive cage in and removing it. It also blocks access for a screwdriver to screw in the bottom front fan, which is why they put plastic fasteners to mount it. If you remove them, you are not likely going to get them back in. The drive cage should have been removable, a lot of people aren't even using 3.5"" drives these days. If the drive bay was removable or the case was about 3"" longer, it wouldn't have been a problem.Even after modding the case to remove the drive bay that was in the way, I had planned to watercool using 2x 240mm EKWB coolstream SE rads, this plan fell through because there is not enough clearance at the top of the case above the motherboard for a radiator and fans. This forced me to use a 360mm rad in the front as a single 240 wasn't going to cut it for a 2080Ti and an i7-12700k. I should have just bought another O11 dynamic XL. I've been building computers for 18 years and this case has been the most frustrating to build in that I've ever used.Update: the 360mm rad and pump wasn't going to fit with the 2080Ti. This case is utterly for water cooling. Get an O11 dynamic, they are much better all around.
"
Edgar Abdiel,4.0,2021 13 March,"
Amazing case overall. It was honestly a pleasant experience working with said case, as it's very sturdy, stylish and easy to work with. The fans provide pretty decent airflow and the argb lighting is honestly pretty nice, plus the rgb controller is a plus. Honestly if you find it at $100 it's almost a must buy in my opinion.The drawbacks however are the following, due to having a mesh grille, this makes it a dust magnet. Get used to giving the case a constant cleanup inside and outside. Another nit-pick that bothered me is the proprietary cable used for the argb fan leds, meaning that if you want full control of your fans you have to buy a separate cable to replace the one it comes with. it isn't a deal breaker but it leaves a sour taste. Apart from those drawbacks, this case is a great buy for both usefulness and design.
"
richard,5.0,2021 22 October,"
This case has everything lined up correct for assembly. I didn't have to adjust anything. The quality is great and there were no defects. The 3 fans work great to cool the components. I may still get a gpu cooler but I haven't been thermal throttling with this case yet, so I'll wait a little while. The power button is a little flimsy for my liking. All the fan mounts are slotted for maximum versatility. I wish it came with fans on the top and back as well. ( Mine aren't as powerful as the ones that came pre installed ) This is a great case.

Note that my experience with this case was transferring from a Corsair Carbide 100R, a cheaper and much flimsier case.Overall really impressed. Feels very sturdy but also doesn't weigh a ton, cable management is good with plenty of tie down points for zip ties or cable ties. Fans are nice and quiet and seem to do a good job of keeping my system cool (Ryzen 5 3600 with Hyper 212 RGB Cooler, MSI Armor RTX 2070). I really like the grooves etched in the tempered glass panel, adds a little bit of flair that other cases were lacking for me and I feel it helps it stand out from the rest. The only complaint that I do have with it (and it is a small one) is that the power supply window is a little too short to display the entire label on my power supply (Corsair RM750X) but that really doesn't bother me all that much. Overall very happy.

Amazon Customer,4.0,2020 24 August,"
I was really excited for this case.. i changes from my fractal meshify c to this. Fans are nice. I love the glass panel. The metal side panel, i hate that thing. My psu holder came bent. Baffles me as it that back corner is in styrofoam.. so it was damaged BEFORE packaging... have better quality control please, I should not have to bend things back into place and then have to screw it in for it to be less bent as well. The PSU filter is pathetic. My previous fractal wins in quality by far. But its still a great case and pretty roomy. I had high expectations for the case and i was let down a little but im still mildly satisfied. I hoped for better. For 99 bucks id still take my meshify c(which i paid 85 for 2 years ago) over this. I needed the extra space though as my 1080ti and 280mm aio didnt play nice in the meshify.

it's a great airflow case for 100 bucks. I used this case for my old 4790k and 780ti pc I built back in 2014. it's a definite upgrade from my cheap diypc case I bought back then. some might not like the crystal look but I think it looks good and makes it a little bit more unique. the rgb fans work ok idk if they are the best fans for pushing air so you probably want to upgrade those fans in the future to make use of the ""airflow"" aspect of the case. also be careful not to lose the bottom dust filter for the power supply because it likes to pop out every once in a while. last thing is that it's a bit of a squeeze back by the power supply to connect your cables. tooke a little bit to make everything not too bunched up and connected but it's doable.

 This case was easy to build in. RGB fusion is trash but it did control the case fans without too much difficulty. Also make sure to check your PSU length, as I had to remove the side of the HDD cage closest to the rear and then attach all of the modular cables before sliding the PSU in, and routing these cables through the back was difficult due primarily to the fact that they were all bunched up coming out of the side of the HDD cage, though the cable tie down points made it somewhat easier to route them and keep them low profile.The case fans seem to move a lot of air and I cannot hear anything outside of the case. Coupled with sticks of RGB Vengeance Pro, it looks quite nice!
"
john paul,4.0,2020 7 November,"
Weird periodic noises coming from my PC. It runs silently but then there would be this loud buzzing noise that lasts for a bit. Could be a loose part somewhere on my end but I've checked everything and I have a feeling it's the case. Otherwise, very cool and very airy. Quality of material is okay too good, but not great. The bottom filter is cheaply made and not magnetic like at the top of the case. Lots of area for upgrades. Remote to control front panel rgb fans are going to be inside unless you figure out how to put the remote outside of the case while still connected to the inside parts. The front where you can see the PSU is kind of awkward though. Can't really see the name of the PSU completely.
"
Ryan Redecker,5.0,2021 21 April,"
Case is fairly easy to work in. Pre-installed fans leave a lot to be desired but I was going to remove them to have all matching fans anyways. They used plastic braces to hold the bottom pre-installed fan in instead of screws which makes it a pain to remove and the location of the hard-drive/power supply bay makes it a little hard to get a third fan screwed in without disassembly but not impossible.In all its a nice case only really have minor issues definitely should be used with an NVME storage cuz other storage options aren't convenient, SSD mounting locations are blocked if MB or Power supply is already installed, and frankly you need to remove the HDD bay for cable management.

 This case is beautiful and very well made. I didn’t have any issues fitting anything at all. I got my inspiration from a fellow reviewer of this case, as it looked absolutely beautiful. The glass on the side is so crystal clear, it looks like nothing is there! I was able to hide all my wires as well!Build:Intel Core i7-10700K UnlockedAsus Z490A with Aura SyncGTX 1060 miniCorsair Vengeance RGB Pro RAM 2x8gbID Cooling Zoomflow 360XMasterFan MF 120 Halo White EditionID Cooling HA-01 Fan Speed and ARGB HubT Force Delta RGB SSD (500gb)

Once you've been building computers for a while you start to appreciate simple things that just work. I am a person who enjoys performance over having the fanciest gadgets and this case does deliver. Added some fans at the top and one at the rear and this puppy is staying cool with no water cooling solutions. Really the only complaint I can make is that the cable management set up in the back isn't the best, not bad mind you, but at 100 dollars you really can't complain IMO. There is plenty of room for those who might decide to do a custom water loop solution. Great case, great value, the only tips I would give is to get a fan for the rear and if you can, 2 at the top for a great airflow solution.

Like the title says, the case looks great. Very clean looking and the lights are awesome to look at. Fits my 1080ti no issue, but feel like with it and an i10 processor it runs just a little hot in a tight space. I attempted to put a standard 360mm radiator w/ fans on the top for the CPU, but the way it's spaced leaves the case fractions of an inch too short for the center fan to fit, with it bumping into the RAM

The case is simply beautiful and so big it provides amazing airflow and so many options with the size it’s perfect for a power house or to provide amazing temps for a low specs build that really helps it go a long way! Perfect case one of the best on the market in my opinion 👌🏻

mike,5.0,2021 15 April,"
This is the first case ive ever purchased & I have nothing bad to say about it.I like how there are ways to easily manage cords within this case.I like how it had 3 fans already installed on the front.I love the dust protection screens on the front, top and bottom where the battery is. Though the one on the bottom didn't have magnets to make it stay in place like the top one does. but its fine.The glass side can be taken off and on very easily.Overall its a 4.9would have been a 5 if that bottom screen had a better way to stay in place.but seriously its not very important..
"
Hung Pui,4.0,2021 20 May,"
Very happy with this case, however there is a portion that appears to be an area for two slot height vertical GPU mounting that is just a dummy spot that has vents and is not capable of using in this manner without heavy modification. While this feature was not advertised, it's reminiscent to jean or jacket pockets that are sewn shut. Just make the area functional please! Otherwise the case is very easy to use and we'll equipped. Added my own 120mm fans on the top for venting.

Lazlo US,4.0,2021 20 April,"
This is probably one of the easiest cases I have working in for a while. Plenty of space for installation and plenty of room for any kind of AIO. Not to mention the system for removing the glass side panel that keeps it from falling off as you’re removing it. The only downside is that for me to have enough room to hide my cable, the 3.5in hard drive cage was removed. Not really too much of an issue if you aren’t using 3.5in drives because there’s plenty of options to mount 2.5in drives all over the case.

My build: ASRock Z490 Taichi (10700k), CM ML360RGB AIO, G.Skill TridentZ RGB RAM, Seasonic Focus PSUOverall this case was really easy to build into and looks nice.  The large side window provides both quick access and full view of the internals.  Wish there was a USB 3.2 Gen 2 port on the front instead of only Gen 1s, also as others have mentioned the PSU/HD compartment at the bottom is a little clunky.The built-in fans are okay (3 pin) though they seem to stall if powered less than 100%, so you'll have to decide when you want them to come roaring on.  Their aRGB connection plugged-in directly and worked seamlessly with my motherboard's header and software.
"
Michael H,4.0,2021 9 January,"
The case is well designed and easy to work with.  There's a good amount of space on the backside for cable management and I did not come across any sharp edges.  The biggest problem I have is the noise from the fans.  All three of the included fans make a buzzing/humming noise that I can hear through my headphones.  It's not egregiously loud but I expected much better from case fans that are $20-$25 a piece.  A quick search in the reviews and the rest of the internet shows that this is a common problem that has been going on for at least half a year.
"
Arn,5.0,2021 30 January,"
This is an awesome case! Amazing airflow, and great looking as well. I’d recommend it to anyone that is looking for a good looking white case and if air flow matters to you. The only thing I wish the back panel was easier to attach. Can be annoying to put back on after wire managing.Edit: I have to knock it one star because of the rgb on the fans. Not the best lighting quality and limited lighting effects on them. All I’m all it’s a good case if you want to not spend so much money on a case with good features. I recommend buying an extra 120mm for the rear. I plan on replacing these fans
"
Matt S.,5.0,2021 28 January,"
Very well designed case. Has a few extras that other cases in that price point don't have such as: ARGB and PWM fan cable splitters, more tie-down hooks for cable management, and support for top-mounted AIOs as well as front and rear. The only down side is the tempered glass side panel is lacking sound dampening (i.e. some type of cushioning), but with today's fan management it's not loud enough to rattle the glass anyway even at full fan power. The only extra I added was a rear exhaust fan, but I didn't actually test it with just the stock fans, so it may not /actually/ be needed. Great case for the money.
"
Loken,5.0,2020 21 December,"
I will put it this way:The case looks fine, utilities were fineThe case fans became audible after one or two months of using so I replaced them with noxtua fans so that's another 140 bucks spentBut it was still alright, until this MF started shaking with the hhd I installed on the storage bracket. At first I thought it was the problem with my hhd so I bought a brand new Seagate one which clear didn't help then I had to lay some soft material underneath the drive to make it less noisyIt's generally an unpleasant experience, next time I would go with fractal design, their build quality is much better trust.
"
Zachary Nolt,5.0,2021 23 February,"
This is a great case for people wanting to build their own computer! The case has a nice power cord shroud to hide the wires in and lots of space for everything you need. Overall the build quality is good the bottom dust catcher is a little annoying since it's a cut out of mesh and easily falls out when moving the computer around and the back panel can be a chore to get on once all the cords are run. The case looks sharp and allows my computer to breathe and does a good job of looking sleek when finished. (Will try to remember to post pictures of it)
"
Chris,5.0,2021 7 January,"
This case is a perfect case for a mid-tower build. I have a 240mm AIO mounted in the front behind the case fans with a single exhaust fan in the rear, and I've never had better temps inside a case. The mesh front allows pretty much the maximum intake and the entire top and rear of the case being cage makes for a great positive pressure keeping dust out of the case. The fans on the front are borderline silent with some pretty cool preset ARGB color options, but a software controller would be much better than opening the case to change the colors. I cannot recommend any other case more than this one
"
T. Gaunt,4.0,2020 15 September,"
I received the first one with a chipped glass panel.  This is plate glass, heavy, and ok, so that can happen with shipping sometimes.  I thought I'd avoid the easy Amazon return and save some planet by asking CoolerMaster to send me a new glass panel.  But the Cooler Master support team NEVER responded to my ticket.  After a week, I gave up on Cooler master support, and just did the quick easy Amazon return.A new one came with good glass, and we really enjoy the look and the ease of use.  Would totally recommend the unit, but I'm slightly suspicious about Cooler Master's support response in the future.
"

really good quality and looks great!
"
Danny,5.0,2020 18 August,"
Pros:TONS of airflow, 7 120mm fan mounts mean lots of cooling.Matte finish looks amazing in white.Angled styling and crystalline glass cut a striking image when paired with RGB.Tons of room for cable management, and nice clean grommets.Cons:Basement is not the full length of the case...but it would prevent a 360mm radiator in the front. Not quite sure if this is a con yet but since I don’t use a radiator I’m not convinced I like it.Drive bay frame is not removable without a fair bit of hassle. This was only a minor inconvenience, but an inconvenience nonetheless.All in all I am very happy with the case, and my monochromatic build looks absolutely gorgeous.
"
Paige Suckow,2.0,2020 11 November,"
Don't buy this case if you are looking for proper cooling! The first case that I bought off of Amazon had strong fans that got weaker in the span of a week. The ARGB only lit up twice before dying completely in that same week. Amazon was great at trying to help out with these issues, so nothing against them. Cooler Master however has absolutely horrible customer service. Their customer service gave me the run around for almost a month while constantly blaming components such as my Corsair RM 750X PSU, my ASUS TUF B550M-Plus (Wi-Fi) motherboard, my AMD Ryzen 7 3700x CPU and included Wraith Prism cooler or blaming me for not plugging things in correctly. Cooler Master absolutely refused to admit that their product was faulty and asked me to test the fans individually. The lovely people at amazon shipped me a brand new case that is identical to my first one. The fans are an okay strength and the ARGB works with this one. I am severely dissatisfied and constantly worried about my components now. Lately when I have been doing nothing except for running fan Xpert 2, I have been seeing CPU package temps in the 130 degree F to 164 degree F range. I had to buy three completely separate cpu fans and install them in my case to hopefully keep the temps inside the case from cooking my components. I have no idea why this one tower case is higher on the list than other cases that have airflow as a first priority. The instructions are a bunch of pictures than can be confusing to figure things out with when installing the motherboard or other essential computer parts. Save your money and get a different case. Corsair sells a 220 T tower case that is made out of steel and has a glass side panel for the same price.

 Side panel and front panel looks amazing. Got room for RGB strips on the front of you want more lightsWish the shroud extended all the way to the front of the case.If you want to add 140mm to the front I suggest making new mounting holes because they are currently see to be placed at the very bottom and halfway on the middle openings. Top fans don't leave any room for rbg strips as they are right up against the edge but you can add lights to the bottom. Overall very nice case for the money.P.s. try not to place a big heatsink on there. The noctua nh-u14s 140mm heatsink barely fits with the panel on.

Lizzy,5.0,2022 19 March,"

"
Jason li,4.0,2021 31 July,"
Purchasing this case for $50 from it’s original value was a steal. This “used” case looks and feels new, since it was refurbished. No problems except for the fact that I ordered a white case but received a black one
"
Wildman657,4.0,2021 26 February,"
I was a bit worried at first if it would arrive damaged, however when I took it out to inspect the case all those worries were quickly washed away. No scratches, dents, or damaged ports. Everything needed is included where the PSU would normally go, and the cables are twist tied together along the back. It comes with 3 fans and a RGB control hub.  Using this to build a Ryzen 7 3700x machine, haven't built a PC in a little over 7 years so this is going to be a lot of fun for me!
"
Bryan Garcia,5.0,2021 7 June,"
This case is a good case if you want to incorporate lots of fans and AIOs into your build. Only gripe is you need special screws if you want to do a push-pull configuration with a front mounted AIO but they’re fairly cheap screws. Cable management is decent and it’s easy to route your power supply cables since this case uses large cable portals.Added photos comparing the cpu temps at idle loads.Old case: NZXT h510 - 45° idleTD500 Mesh - 29° Idle16° delta with the case alone.
"
Tristen,4.0,2020 20 December,"
Pros: Nice Airflow, three preinstalled fans, and its just a nice case in general.Cons: Lack of space in the back to manage cables.Things to know: The fans run at about 900 to 1000 rpm which is ok if you want it to be quiet and I personally think that the fans look bad and are of poor quality but 3 argb fans and a case for only 99 dollars is pretty cheap. Would put a picture of my built but phone is dead so Ill update this later and add picture so you can see what the back looks like.
"
Winkie,4.0,2020 1 September,"
honestly i love it i read a lot of reviews about getting a damaged product but mine seems fine all though the cords that already come plugged in are a bit confusing i’m assuming they’re for the fan lights but i have no idea where to plug them in on the motherboard and it’s my first time building a pc and my friends also are unsure of where they go so i don’t have the lights plugged in): the fans work perfectly fine tho! i like how roomy the inside is and how easy it was to take it apart and put it back together after building my pc.
"
Alyssa Valencia,3.0,2021 16 December,"
Great case and I love it, but it did come slightly damaged where the PSU goes and the bent metal made it very difficult and a two person job to get the PSU mounted properly because of the damage. Overall it’s great and perfect though! And the glass is very durable my cat scratched it (with the clear plastic still on) and only the plastic scratched not the glass. It also has a lip for the glass to it doesn’t fall when unscrewing.

 The mesh and design of this PC case is superb. The air flow thanks to this pc case prevents any overheating. Btw, im using the noctua nh u12a with gigabyte aorus z490 vision g with i7 10700k cpu. Thanks to this pc case, the mesh and airflow design complement the fan cooler i used.OC my gpu and cpu(5.1mhz) and the vrm never went above 65 degrees celsius. On average its at around 48-55 degrees celsius. So if u want to do some serious oveclocking for 10th gen cpus without breaking the bank, this $100 pc case will complement the cooling thanks to the mesh design and triple fan setup.
"
oprib,5.0,2020 8 December,"
For under $100 this has to be on the top of your list. Looks good and has plenty of airflow with magnetic filters. No great option for cable management but this is also a cheaper case so the backside of your case will be Meh unless you are some god tier builder. Lots of options to rout your cables just not much on the back. Fans that it comes with are ok if you are on a budget but I am a Corsair fan guy so I will also promo those when I can and I swapped them out (even though they cost more than the mf case but 🤷🏼‍♀️).
"
Kop,5.0,2021 20 January,"
Case is of good quality, works well for its intended purpose, I do not have any sort of clearance issues with it, airflow is very open. The only thing that bothers me is the fact that the fans are ARGB rather than RGB, making them unusable with color control software on more popular of or most of modern motherboards, and the fans they included seem to be the cheapest fans coolermaster has, despite the fact that this isn't a 'cheap' case. Other than that good case, not deducting points for the fans since they're not something they have to include for the price anyways.
"
José,3.0,2022 7 March,"
First I like this case but the holes for cable management could of been better. My case came with a little nudge on it's side but doesn't bother me. If you have to money to purchase a better case then go for a better case
"
Dalebert Vincent,5.0,2020 14 September,"
I'm now done assembling my PC and it was roomy and easily accommodated a liquid cooler. Cable management was easy. It looks very nice with the three included LED fans on front and the solid glass side. It's a nice change that it's white. I much prefer that to the common black case. I ended up not wanting to hassle with the liquid cooler and just put three fans blowing out for good flow. The whole thing seems to stay quite cool and I'm having no heat mgmt problems with my Ryzen 7. Note that I haven't gotten a new graphics card yet so we'll see but I feel confident.
"
Amazon Customer,2.0,2020 12 October,"
Aside from the thermals, I don't understand how this case is so highly reviewed. Some of my issues may be due to a bad unit, but others are just flat out design issues.The PSU shroud can not be removed and the installation opening is too small to run front panel cabling through it. I had to re-route my HD audio and sys fan cables after they were almost severed against the PSU and the edge of the shroud openingThe drive bay can not be removed, so the PSU cables get pressed tightly against the drive bay. This makes cable management an issue and, combined with the small PSU shroud opening, makes it very difficult to remove or rewire the PSU.The feet are uneven, so the whole case can rock back and forthThe front panel headphone jack is just bad. When normally connecting a pair of headphones, the sound comes out as mono. If I press harder, I can either get a stereo signal or just the left channel.All of the front panel IO generally feels very stiff and cheap. USB and 3.5mm devices don't connect smoothly and usually require a good shove.There was a paper barcode sticker on the back of the case. It took a good amount of scraping and goo-gone to remove it.In fairness, the thermals are good and the fans are fine. The fan lighting and control via the MSI app work well. There's just enough room for basic cable management in the back of the case, so it's passable.Overall, I definitely regret buying this case and would have returned it if I wasn't so impatient
"
Nate,4.0,2021 10 June,"
There is plenty of space in this case and has more than enough air flow. The only reason this is a 4 star review is because the 3 included fans stopped lighting up after about 2 days of having the thing.
"
Kyle,4.0,2020 8 October,"
I think this tower is great. The airflow is good, cable management is easy and well thought, the only problem I have is that the hot swap bays for your SSD'S and HDD's is too close to the PSU. I have a fully modular power supply and I really had to wedge the PSU in with all the cables attached. If you have a semi modular you might not run into this problem but it was a bit annoying for me. And no, you cannot take out the hot swap bay.
"
Kindle Customer,5.0,2020 31 December,"
This was my first DIY PC build.  This case stuck out to me because of the three front intake fans, room for a 240mm AIO radiator at top and cable management system. It will fit a monster GPU. the front fans are RGB, but you don't need to use them if you don't want to. Even with them turned on it's pretty modest. The tempered glass side panel is great to show off your parts or if you want to show off your RGB set up. Everything was really simple, and has performed great so far!
"
Rh3mY,5.0,2020 23 July,"
There is so much room to work with in this case.  The fans are so quiet too.  Everything is so bright!  I also have a Cooler Master 240mm liquid cooler installed at the top exhaust.  The tool-free HDD cage is nice and easy to access.  The power supply bay is isolated, filtered and is reversible.  I have nothing negative to note about this case.  The motherboard cutout is huge too.  It was easy to set up and very flashy.  Pictures don't do this case justice.  I don't know what the warmth rating is.  This case is very cool figuratively and literally!
"
S. Bezar,5.0,2021 26 January,"
This case is such a great value for the price. It looks so fancy and the LEDs are AWESOME! It's clean and easy to put together. Just make sure you got through the instructions before you start since it doesn't have them in exactly the right order for everything (at least not for my build, haha)Love it and especially love how the vent on the top has a removeable filter that keeps the dust out and is easy to clean. Fans are nice and quiet but do a great job.
"
Daveeeeeeep,5.0,2020 13 October,"
Real glass, heavy construction, sturdy. Case overall is really nice. Only complaint would be to have a few more fan slots but not sure where they'd even put them so its not a very reasonable complaint on my part. The case itself looks nice and very clean, not surprisingly you're able to hide every cable so it has a very minimal look to it inside. Have always love coolermaster products and would definitely buy this again/recommend. Dont know who is still using cd drives but obviously thats not possible with this case just in case youre living in the past.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 24 May,"
Td500 Mesh and ARGB. This is a solid case. The style is personal preference. The etched tempered glass is a nice touch. The fans are a little noisy but I adjust the fan curves and everything is fine. Building is very straightforward with plenty of room for expansion.With 3 fans and a real mesh front, I feel out of the box thermals would be good. I would add at least 1 exhaust fan in the back, though.I think the T500 Mesh is a good buy for first time builders, builders looking to upgrade because of air flow or builders looking for a case that looks different but provides good air flow.
"
Daniel Casildo,5.0,2020 28 August,"
Honestly, I had my doubts because it was basically $100 and there are great quality for cheaper but it shipped earlier than expected and I looked at the case and came perfectly intact. The rgb fans came plugged in to rgb controller, all stand offs were wrapped with the other cables neatly where the psu shroud is, and the cable management is great. Would 100% recommend if your build is more on the higher budget side and want something that looks nice. If you have a lower budget go for a cheaper, good quality case so you could spend the money in other areas.
"
Samuel Quiroz,5.0,2020 7 October,"
This was the case I went for my first build and it came out great. A lot of room for what I needed and excellent cut outs for cable management. Seriously, it was really easy to build with. Great for those wanting to use a push pull configuration in the front. Kind of a hassle to install by yourself but it is possible! Also, I recommend that you don't use any hard drives. By removing the mounts located inside the power supply shroud, you can give yourself more room to store cables if you just wanna to stuff them inside.

"
Kyle M.,2.0,2020 4 September,"
great quality, amazing design, and cooler master reliability. 3 case fans alone puts this case above just about everything at this price and they are not cheep fans, the fans alone will cost you almost 60 dollars purchased separately. recommend this case to anyone looks great at an unbeatable price point, beyond that it proforms great. the only complaint is the fan wires are a bit of a rats nest and the bottom of the case has a gap into the back that makes hiding the case fan wires a slightly harder job than it needs to be.Pros:looks amazinggood RGB not cheap flashy lights3 good fans included.good airflow at the priceCons:wire management is a bit harder than it needs to be due to the rat's nest that is the stock fanswire management made ever so slightly harder by hole next to PSU slot,mesh at the bottom of the PSU is not magneticcooler master logo on the front is not easy to remove.EDIT: the fans RGB failed suddenly, CM support is absolutely worthless they don’t reply to you took 27 total support tickets to finally be told they would not replace the fans and I would need to return the entire case, Amazon CS gave me a bill credit of 60 dollars to purchase a set of fans I spend a little more and got a nice set. While this is still the best case at this price point. Spend a little more and get something better
"
Brenda,5.0,2021 23 March,"
This case is perfect for someone who wants a different case. I started off with a Montech mini ATX, but Upgrading my computer meant I needed some more space, This case comes with awesome fans that are really quiet, plus they are cooler master fans that you can buy on amazon for extra fans. I love the design and the case is a quality product. The glass is heavy and durable, and the overall look is incredible.
"
Allan B.,5.0,2021 22 February,"
First time seeing a glass side panel like this, might be a very love it or hate it style, but I love it - This case has great airflow and while the metal and plastic used in the case doesn't feel the strongest, it's fine - not super cheap feeling either.  The glass panel is top notch though in terms of quality. Would easily fit a 360 AIO in the front if I wanted and cable management was a breeze.
"
Alluring,4.0,2020 31 August,"
Pros: cool looks, reset switch, low tempsCons: front fans suck, front panel feels very cheap, psu dust filter is crapOne to two of the front 3 pre installed fans will not spin once the PC is fully booted. I tested all the fan headers and it is not an issue with the motherboard. This problem persists 6 out 10 times I boot the computer. The fans themselves work, but potentially a ball bearing issue. Temps have suffered due to this issue.

"
Chase,5.0,2021 8 February,"
I’ve been using this case for about a week and so far I’m loving it! Front glass and back panel are easy to remove and put back, instillation of my motherboard was easy. The wire management was easy with convenient wire holes. I get great ventilation (3 intake fans, 3 exhaust fans)  only small down side is the RGB lights on the fans only have a few settings. But that’s ok, I found one that goes well with my color scheme.
"
Mason Middleton,5.0,2020 21 December,"
I like the case very much, having the 3 fans at the front and already them accessible to hook up is a great in my book. In this case I was able to fit about 4 more 120mm fans, an Asus Prime z390-A and a Zotac 2060 Super. This case looks really good with the RNG and has maintained a cool state since my purchase. If you have a bigger motherboard this isn't for you but other than that I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!!!!
"
AC,3.0,2022 3 January,"
Not sure if it's just me, but my 3 120mm lighting fans are generating some random noises which I don't know how to fix and it's really annoying. I would have given it 5 stars if they come with better quality 120mm fans

 Great case with lots cooling capabilities and air flow. Specially love the 3 front stock ARGB fans. After 7 years of not building a custom PC, I came back to the game not knowing what to pick for a case. Most cases out there look very similar in design. The Cooler Master TD500 Mesh design is the most attractive unique design on the market.
"
Kristina M.,5.0,2021 27 January,"
I assembled a computer inside this case, which is pretty easy since there is a lot of room. As soon as I turned it on the ARGB fans lit up the inside beautifully. Easy to clean as well since you just remove the front panel and blow off the dust (Tested with the black variant that I also own). I recommended and showed it to my friend which he said he would most likely buy one. Great case for the price.

Beautiful case. Can't wait to finish assembly and power it up.My only issue is the window for the motherboard. Shouldn't there be a frame of sorts? Or was I supposed to acquire one with the motherboard? This is my first time building a computer, so I'm learning as a go.
"
J. McCarthy,5.0,2021 23 July,"
Love this case. It has lots of features that make for an easy build and cable management - plus it looks really cool! The only thing I wasn't sure about were the 2.5 drive mounts. They are a little different, just a screw peg with rubber mounts, but they work really well.
"
Kota,5.0,2021 7 November,"
Honestly great case, very roomy. There’s more than enough space for upgrades.I just bought the case and handed it off for the build.
"
Jeremy Green,4.0,2021 30 April,"
A great case for midrange builds.  Plenty of soace, decent cable management, and a unique look.  Airflow is solid.  Build quality of back panel area and PCI/PSU are not the best, but worth the price!
"
Ben W.,5.0,2021 28 June,"
Case is super well made, lots of room, and great airflow and decent cable management. The only thing to beware is adding a 360mm radiator on top - depending on your motherboard it may be difficult to insert RAM and manage the upper cables. I still managed to do it, and the PC looks and works great!
"
Ethan,3.0,2020 17 November,"
Though the case looks great I would not recommend buying this product unless you have the full intentions of replacing all the fans with a different brand as these do not provide any cooling for your components. My case also came with faulty fans and upon trying to resolve the issue through amazon the only options they gave were to disassemble my entire PC and replace the case entirely, or they would offer me a 20% discount for my troubles and $20 is not enough to replace all 3 fans. The audio ports are also not ideal, they require a lot of force to plug in and remove equipment and don't provide the best connection. I'm unsure of how long they will last with that kind of ware on the ports like that. The provided room for installing power plugs is minimal and hard to maneuver as well. So keep this in mind while you're ordering this product.

Ran,5.0,2021 3 February,"
Tech Jesus said it was pretty good with thermals and this one was quickly available. Was doing a new build so didn't want to wait for ""in stock on---"" items. Running good temps and it's quiet, granted this is also my first time running an AIO so maybe that's why. Good openings for running cables, easily able to remove extra items, like hard drive spacers since I'm just using NVME on mine. Clean case.
"
Taylor,3.0,2020 19 July,"
I love the design and it came without any damage to the product; however, the box did get damaged before it arrived.With a Corsair H100i, there will be a gap to fill with another fan since it supports 360mm worth of fans on the top; also, the RAM (XPG Spectrix D60G) seems to barely fit on the top with the radiator and fan and an ASUS Prime x570 pro. There is a window on the CPU shroud, so keep that in mind if you get a black PS. Lastly, the top dust filter has bigger holes than I expected, so I'll be using fans there to push (move air out)I haven't assembled anything yet, so my only reason for 3 stars is because I was sent a black case instead of a white. I think the black one will do just fine, and with the damaged box and so many reviews about the case getting damaged during shipping it seems safer to keep the one I was sent.
"
Prekay,5.0,2021 9 March,"
Absolutely beautiful. I just set it up today and all my friends are super jealous! 😍 I’m so happy with it! (I added an extra fan to the back, the case only comes with three fans all on the front!) I will say that my power button feels a bit awkward to press, but it’s not a big deal! I love this case! The case is also staying amazingly cool! Awesome!
"
Fitzj,5.0,2021 2 July,"
I bought used and it's basically new. Only the box was a bit beat up but the case was fine and had all the parts in it. The 4000 D is cheaper but this was the same price used so I went for that and I'm satisfied with it and no complaints so far
"
Kindle Customer,4.0,2021 6 August,"
looks great but not enough room for wires in the back
"
Asher Stubbs,3.0,2021 27 August,"
The build quality is pretty good. Instructions are vague and confusing with no written english just pictures illustrating. My main complaint is this will not accommodate a coolermaster 240 cpu cooler with my tomahawk b450 motherboard as it interferes with the ram. Had to do a front mount cooler which is not ideal. The controller that comes with the case for the argb fans is also pretty sucky, not having the selection for the color we were wanting as our mobo does not have argb headers.
"
Tristan Rice,3.0,2020 28 August,"
Let me first off in giving some background I bought this case for my 3rd PC build I liked the front case design, side glass panel, and the the three large fans on the front of the case. I felt that that was ample amount of cooling. Then the build started... the bottom deck for the power supply is very tight for a 750W power supply and good luck plugging any new pci ports after installed. The RGB is a nightmare still haven't gotten all the bugs worked out with that yet two fans are light but one is not and i cannot change the color. They don't really give you anything with the case or support online with troubleshooting with there products. Over all experience ascetically beautiful case strong and sound would recommend an output fan as my GPU does run a little on the warm side but for the money not a bad option but there are way better cases on the market.
"
Trey,5.0,2021 25 June,"
Great case. Lots of cable routes. Comes with the 3 front fans that have RGB, you can use the included controller, or if your MOBO has a connection to control the color scheme. Does NOT have an exhaust fan at the back of the case, no big deal fans are cheap. Great air flow.
"
Jay,5.0,2020 20 June,"
Changed a few things but great looking case. Full diclosure I used my own fans in the pic.Complains:The dust filter for the power supply is horrible. Seen this desing before as cost cutting measure but this is be far the worst.I hate power supply cut outs. I was not about to spend money on a white power supply so just bought some vinyl wrap for $10 and turned out pretty good.Lastly I wish the basement ran all the way across the bottom of the case for a cleaner look.
"
joshua weimer,5.0,2021 21 December,"
Great cooling.  3080ti TUF card stays 60-65c air cooled.
"
Sickone,5.0,2020 24 July,"
This case has great looks with rgb fans and some of the best airflow since the HAF cases of 10 years ago. well worth the money.Edit, this case does not need a filter material due to the size of the mesh, it is easy to keep clean and keeps the dust to a minimum inside the case after 3 months of use (24/7 use) my case has a total of 7 fans in it 3 intake and 4 exhaust and have never had any temperature issues.
"
Dawn,5.0,2020 26 September,"
Absolutely amazing! This is my first PC build and my boyfriend helped me pick out the case. It looks so pleasing, the color options are really nice, and it’s BIG!I didn’t think it would be as big as it is, but I really like it. Tons of space inside for everything I need, and the added zip ties and spots in the back to hide everything are real nice and keep it looking good. I’m really happy with this purchase :)
"
William Rabquer,5.0,2020 26 May,"
To start off I really like the look of this case it really can turn any computer into a looker! It has a solid build quality and an awesome looking side panel! The fans are barely audible and if you can find a good cooler master program to run them they look really nice!My only con is that the power supply shroud is riveted in place and cannot be removed.Besides that for $100 you are getting a $100 quality case as well as a free $50 gift of fans! Highly recommend!
"
Deeply Disappointing Spoon,5.0,2020 27 October,"
The air flow is bae. Three stock fans definitely ARGB and integrated perfectly on my B-550.My favorite part about the front stock fans is that it kind of prevents people from incorrectly mounting the water cooling they often buy, too. It's a bit of a stretch to front mount an AIO in this case, as it is a stretch for the hoses to get from the CPU down to the bottom of the front of the case.
"
Rhett,5.0,2021 12 September,"
I built my first PC in June and selected this case. It took me a couple hours to build but everything was easy to mind and there’s a lot of extra space!
"
Oscar,5.0,2020 30 November,"
Stunning case. Great price and easy to build on. The only con is that if you're using a top mounted AIO cooler then you must install the ram beforehand as you won't have enough space to remove it or replace it. You have to unscrew your radiator if you want to add or remove ram afterwards. No biggie.Love the case. The front fans are great but do make more noise than I'd like.
"
CD,3.0,2021 3 February,"
Loved this thing at first. Looks great, came with 3 fans, was easy to build in... cable management cound be a bit bigger of an area but it works.I didn't get the rest of my build parts in until early January so I was able to use this case until then...Within a month the bottom front fan sometimes stops spinning and I can't figure out why. Seems to get stuck. Cables are all solidly connected, nothing is in the way... it just stops working. A hard blow on it gets it back spinning but for a fan to begun havung issues running at fairly low RPMs on a very low use basis... maybe 3 or 4 hours a week tops... this fast is kind of ridiculous.Other than that I love the case.
"
SkyePanda,5.0,2021 26 August,"
One of the best cases I worked in! Has amazing airflow along with being minimalistic. I retired an older pc case and wow.... Can a good looking case really make a system pop with color!
"
Hl,3.0,2022 8 January,"
There is a rgb fan, the light of the rgb fan is not in good contact and not light up, can you replace it with a fan?
"
Jason Lee,5.0,2020 27 September,"
The case is great, very sturdy, and overall has a great look!The only issue that I have with the case is that it is very cramped and was very difficult to insert some plugs onto the motherboard. Another issue that I had was that I ordered a white case, but a black case was delivered. I was pretty upset upon arrival, but after putting together my PC it looks great!Very affordable and great product for its value!
"
Brian B,5.0,2021 17 February,"
Great airflow rgb fans connect well with armory crate software however it is a pain to connect all the rgb wires and get the rgb working also the wires are really sensitive  so try not to reconnect and disconnect a lot otherwise you going to have to strain the wires  in order for them to work but otherwise great case with good airflow
"
Carlos,5.0,2020 3 July,"
This case is amazing and sexy at the same time. Not a ton of airflow but decent. Make sure that you get a few more fans. Lot of room and lots of space for wire management. RGB is addressable and looks awesome. Tempered glass is thick and solid. Great design and can be opened without tools. Plenty of room inside for water cooling and can support 3 additional fans if using 120mm. Lots of space for motherboard and Graphics card. Very well made case and color is sweet!
"
Finch,5.0,2020 27 June,"
Looks great and keeps all my hardware thermals at optimal levels for over clocking and high end gaming performance. I did have to reroute the USB cables, power button cable, and the audio input cable to keep them out of site but it took about 2 min to hide them. The SSD mount in the back was very convenient and gets an extra 2 drives in my machine.  I rate this 10/10. I would def recommend to anyone looking to get a case with good airflow.
"
Paul,5.0,2020 14 September,"




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 This box went perfect for the white build I wanted to go for. Matching components was easy and had no problem with finding correct attachments. I will recommend however to purchase the usb 3.0 sata adapter extension. You will have some trouble fitting the large USB 3.0 cable to the motherboard and fitting ssd drives to the proper lacation. Plus it makes for good cable management.
"
Aaron Preston Aldrich,5.0,2021 8 September,"
Loved how easy it was to build in this case.  Love the design on front mesh and etching on glass side panel.  Cooler master is my fav!
"
Whitney,5.0,2020 10 September,"
Love this case was really easy to put together for a first time pc build.Really beautiful and does a great job keeping things cool.Usb ports are in good locations.Only down side (but my fault)  is the my motherboard only has hook ups for rgb and not argb which is what the case has so I can't control light color of the fans. Nonetheless they look great to me so no worries.
"
John Tristan Palanca,5.0,2021 16 February,"
This case should cost way more than it does. Build quality is great and airflow is unmatched. The 3 included ARGB fans work great with Asus Aura Sync and come attached to a 3-1 splitter out of the box. The other plus besides killer airflow is the ease of cable management. Cooler Master really thought this one out, super happy with this!
"
Brandon,5.0,2020 19 November,"
this is one of the best cases ive built in. good cable management great looks great air flow pre installed atx stand off's great build quality for 100 bucks reusable pcie plates  3 great argb fans which are 20 bucks a pop by themselves. only downside ive found is the rgb is confusing too hook up and the instructions didn't really help much for that. other than that amazing buy.
"
Joseph,3.0,2021 22 March,"
For starters this is a beautiful case. That said, the mesh front panel, though can be removed, might cut your fingers trying to take it off. It's a big pain. The only dust filter they give you is on the top of the case... The top... We're your pushing air from the inside up and out... Why? Do I need to filter the air that comes from my pc? Or my room... Answer is my room... That said, it was not well thought out. Ether way I'll make due with some form of custom dust filter for the front. The bottom psu shroud cover does NOT come out. This makes for very tight custom work of water cooling or even getting screws in the bottom front fan.
"
stephen phillips,5.0,2021 2 April,"
This case is great. Lots of air flow. A lot of room in this case, I fit both of 240mm rads in it with no fitment issues at all. Wiring is a bit tight in the back but not too bad. I picked this up on sale but would have paid full price if I had to.
"
Tony K.,5.0,2021 8 June,"
Great case, easy to build with good cable management. I also have a bunch of shredding pets and was a little worried that hair would get past the fans in the front—-that hasn’t happened and it’s been several months running! Highly recommend this one.Oh, and it looks great!
"
Henry Wing,5.0,2021 4 February,"
This case is beautiful, easy to open and put back on, offers a lot of space for add-ons and great airflow. The only bad thing is the distance in the back of the case, they don’t give you enough room to do cable management well so you have to sorta fight to get the back panel on again
"
Argusi,5.0,2020 8 August,"
Used this for my sons first gaming PC build and it was great to work on. Really appreciate being able to remove the drive cage for more room, not that the case is cramped. There's plenty of room in there for extra peripherals. We were going to set it up and see if more fans were needed, but it's keeping everything plenty cool with the stock 3 fans in our configuration. Highly recommend this case.
"
Glizzy Gobbler 6000,5.0,2021 25 September,"
This cooler box is very good I can fit a lot of chicken and pork in there and it stays cool!
"
gilbert,5.0,2020 22 November,"
Overall pretty good. Good airflow, a lot of extra room coming from a H510. I did have minor Glass defects but it’s hard to see at certain angles. Power supply dust filter is not that useful. Also.. rgb fans that are included are 5v / 3 pin did not work with my mobo. (Msi b450 T max) Had to get a converter to work.
"
Andrea Stapleton,5.0,2020 3 December,"
I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday (he has been eyeing it for months). It made it before his bday (BONUS POINTS). He LOVES it. Came properly packaged (so no dings or scratches). Beautoful tower. Highly recommend. Thank you for  helping me make my boyfriend's birthday a bit more special (he is a pain to buy gifts for). 100/100.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 22 March,"
Great case with LOTS of airflow and room to work with. If you don't care or need a disc drive or a ton of HDDs then I would get this case. Will replace the top 2 140mm i currently have with 3 120mm ones soon. Getting great temps while gaming or when mining overnight.
"
Heather Wiese,5.0,2020 25 October,"
This case is fantastic!! Tons of room for my fans, I only air cool so I am running 6 case fans and two fans on my 212 evo cooler which fits comfortably. The Tempered glass makes a good seal for air flow and I love all the room for cable management. Those looking for a good air flow case on the cheap should start here.
"
Emanuel Pergjoni,5.0,2020 19 November,"
Bought this for my new pc build, overall great quality case, a few things to note is that it doesn't come with an exhaust fan so I recommend buying one or moving one from the front to the back. Also if u do not set a custom fan curve at idle it is very quiet but when gaming they seem to speed up alot
"
Federico,5.0,2021 26 December,"
Todo muy bien
"
Alex,4.0,2021 3 January,"
the case is pretty, but my 360mm cpu cooler kinda conflict with my RAM cuz when u put the cooler on your ram will be stuck or wont even fit. Also, the fans are sort of loud but theyre cool tho

 Wanted a case for high air flow to keep the pc cool. This does the trick. Easy to build in and plenty of space to keep everything tidy. The cooler master software for the lighting is pretty easy to use to get the lighting the way you want it. Overall no complaints.

Si/Pedro,5.0,2021 31 December,
Alex Cannon,3.0,2020 12 October,"
PROS*3 Pre installed fans*Nice mesh dust filter for the front panel for airflow*Okayish magnetic dust filters on the top of the case and on the PSU intake twords the bottom.*Sleek, Clean look*Easy to install and take off side panels.CONS*Good lord the cable management room on this case is non existent, trying to fit a basic ATX PSU was what caused me to write this review in the first place, theres no room for cables.*Case fan names aren't specified anywhere and dont move much air at all.*no support for 140mm exhaust fans.OVERALLDecent beginners case, itll stress you out but itll keep all your parts together and it wont suffocate them. If you can afford it an extra 100 or 50 bucks can get you a better case.
"
Michael,3.0,2022 8 January,"
There are no screws in the box at all.  It makes me wonder if it's used...super disappointing
"
TheSeanJones,5.0,2020 4 July,"
Fantastic case, looks amazing. Fit Corsair liquid cooling, Z490 Intel motherboard, asus TUF 1660 super 3x fans, rgb Corsair RAM 8gb x4 and Corsair 750RX power supply in it. All fit well, though I had to make an adjustment to fit both rgb RAM and the liquid cooling. Looks incredibly sleek. Recommend if trying for a build using a white case.Packaging was nice.Chords are high quality and aesthetic.Everything you want from a case.
"
cleon,5.0,2020 23 October,"
I purchased this case for my very first pc build. This case has a great stylish look. The front rgb lights come pre-installed. The only minor thing I didn't like about the case was the space for cable management was a little tight. But that could have been a result of me being a novice pc builder. I highly recommend this case to everyone.
"
Ryan,5.0,2020 6 October,"
Looks great, I did not have any issues with broken parts when I received it, easy to clean. Cable management was a little snug, but I built my first computer with this case so I probably could have routed the cables better. If you are looking for a case for a white pc build I think this is a great choice for the value.
"
Kevin DuVall,5.0,2021 5 March,"
The case looks really cool and clean. I am very particular with things, so I can tell some of the plastic isn't the highest quality and the fans maybe aren't cooler master's highest quality fans either. However, for the price, this thing is awesome. I can't not give it 5 stars overall.
"
ANDREW,3.0,2021 7 February,"
This is a decent case that I bought only because it was the only thing in stock. While the airflow is good, it has some design issues:The case is on a cramped side. It could have been a few inches longer / wider for easier access.The PSU area is very difficult to get to.The PSU air filter is a flimsy mesh that doesn't have a frame, making removing/installing it a painThe top mesh filter is held magnetically. This is fine as long as one doesn't have a cat that likes to jump up on a computer.The front bezel connectors are left as individual plugs, making connection to the motherboard a bit of a hassle.
"
Mary Ellen,5.0,2021 9 May,"
Love it! Fits my comments nicely and and the mesh looks amazing, if you get the asus prime x570-pro it will hid half of the top metal bracket but other then that it's amazing. Has nice room for cable management if you know what you are doing.
"
walker Rowcliffe,3.0,2021 11 December,"
Case is really nice and the white has held up. Roomy, only thing is the glass side panel scratch so easy
"
J,4.0,2020 20 December,"
Not a bad looking case with RGB fans included. The airflow is good I have a rtx3070 and Ryzen 5 5600x and it never gets hot. I do have total of 7 fans so that helps as well
"
Patrick W. Lamar,5.0,2021 29 April,"
This case looks super nice.  I know that some people have complained about cable management but with some time and patience I was able to have a tidy install.  Additionally the cooling in this case is amazing and has very good air flow.
"
Kris,4.0,2020 22 December,"
This was delivered and it was wrong color. It is not black, it was white! Matches my son's PS5, so we kept it.My son was building a gaming computer and this case fit his rtx 3070.
"
Gary Christian,5.0,2020 7 November,"
This was a great buy for the price. It's easily accessible with install/cable management and has plenty of room for whatever. The fans are a tad bit noisy but they're not terrible overall and they keep the temps pretty low. The aesthetic of the entire case is very impressive, especially the rgb lights included on the fans.
"
Lilian Vargas,4.0,2020 25 June,"
came in impeccable condition however I didn’t anticipate it to be so large. I should have checked measurements for how big this case would be, it is beautiful and keeps my pc very cool to the touch however if I had done more research I probably would have opted for a smaller case.
"

"
zdsorenson,3.0,2020 1 October,"
Won't fit my mother board and the screws to remove parts to allow stuff to fit are nonsensical non-standard IDK but I will update when I can make my computer b/c right now I can't b/c my motherboard won't fit into this thing and there is no clear screwdriver that I can use to take the case apart.  Idk wtf screws they used on this thing but they clearly aren't standard and I've not been provided a tool to unscrew them.Update, I was being sorta dumb and frustrated, leaving old stuff for context.  Case is decent but I/O shield is hard to fit if pre-installed stand off gets in the way and an adapter screw comes with case but is very unintuitive.
"
Wren,5.0,2020 23 September,"
So pretty!! It does need some additional outtake fans, as the 3 in the front are all I take. It’s really nice that the case comes with 3 rgb fans included and already installed. There’s not a bunch of room for cables in the back, but it’s enough. I love the design and the mesh front and top. Very good value!!
"
Mike s.,5.0,2021 2 October,"
great case. love that it came with fans and rbg light controller
"
Dogebass00,5.0,2021 1 July,"
its a great pc case and other than the fact it had limited instruction is was fairly easy for someone doing their first completely custom build. 10/10 would recommend to the next person.
"
Jay Bizzel,4.0,2020 5 August,"
The case is fine. It was a bit of a pain in the...butt. The compartment for your power supply drives etc...was a bother to mess with otherwise it's a nice unit. 29'th build on my end and this one was difficult. Maybe I'm just gettin' old IDK
"
Kurt T.,5.0,2020 6 December,"
If you are looking for a beautiful tower with amazing lightning and rgb, then this is the one to buy. For less than $100, you can't beat this tower! The only thing I can say negative is the dust gets in too fast but it's not hard to remove once a week.
"
Bryson Bergquist,5.0,2020 26 December,"
Absolutely love this case, it's got holes where you can stick all your cables through from the backend to the frontend of the case. Very easy to take apart and put back together. The 3 pre-installed fans are very convenient and easy to plug in to the motherboard. Awesome Cooler Master product!
"
Spencer Jones,4.0,2020 8 August,"
Overall I love the design. I’m new to PC and everything seems to be functional. My biggest reservation is that the top fan does not light up, which I picked this product for the lighting aesthetic. So that has been very frustrating and disappointing for me.
"
Tom Baldinger,5.0,2021 28 March,"
Fits my Gigabyte B450 Aorus Elite V2 motherboard great.Only problem i had was with using my 360mm AIO in the top it was to long to have a fan in the rear of the case. Other than that everything fits perfect
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 4 October,"
The fans look great when they're powered on, and the mesh front and top make the entire PC super cool (both temperature and looks).One thing though- the cables for the fans can be a bit confusing. I personally didn't use the physical controller, instead plugging the fans into an ARGB header on the mobo.
"
Robert,5.0,2021 31 January,"
Well it comes pre assembled. Bought for a build I'm working on now. Still lacking parts, mainly a GPU. In no rush. Will post pictures when the build is completed. Going for a white/black/silver build and paired with the asus prime z490a it should look decent.
"
Rheyne,5.0,2021 22 June,"
Excellent view of the inside of the case, and excellent cable management options at the back of the case. Makes your components appear more threatening than they actually are, according to guests.

No complaints. Looks really cool. Nothing too crazy to complain about

"
Seamus McDermott,3.0,2021 19 February,"
Kind of a pain in the arse, but the front case fan (lower one of three) fails to start after only one week.If you go to the Cooler Master site, they have a warranty of two years.  Getting warranty service is as easy as pushing a Buick with two flat tires across a gravel parking lot.  The terms make your eyes glaze over.We know the fan is getting power, and it runs if you spin it with your finger.  It just won't start by itself.After less than a week, this is very disappointing.
"
winnieyiyi,5.0,2020 11 December,"
I bought this case for my new PC build and it's been nothing but fantastic ever since it arrived. The quality is very nice and there's really great airflow. I fit a Gaming X Trio 3070 just fine so you can fit any GPU you want in here.
"
Mia Bruzenak,5.0,2020 16 September,"
I absolutely love it!! I did not put it together, but my boyfriend did and he completed it so quickly! The colors are beautiful and I never feel any heat from it. The colors do turn off when the computer is off which is a great energy saver. Very esthetic and worth it!

Samantha Verna,5.0,2021 2 September,"
I had my friend assemble it for me. I love the outcome

Danial Hallock,5.0,2020 24 May,"
I ordered the white case the day it came out, and unlike the black case it did NOT arrived damaged, nor do the concerns about the glass being cheap appear valid.  It did not, however, come with a rear fan.Otherwise, the reviews on the black case being easy to assemble, yadda yadda translate well to the white case.
"
Agustin Marquez,5.0,2020 25 June,"
I love this case! (TD500 Mesh White ARGB) It's amazing with plenty of space for cable managing and even more space if you remove the hdd mounts located at the bottom of the case. The fans do their job while looking great as well. The tempered glass is beautiful. Overall i am very happy and pleased with this purchase.

This case was easy to assemble and offered a lot of great cable managment opportunities. Generally this is a solid case for the price. However the biggest complaint I have with this case is related to the front panel. This case's fans can vibrate your case, because they do not come with any anti vibration pads on the screws. While running my case at certain fan rpms i can gear a loud vibrating noise coming from my case and even feel the front panel vibrating to the touch. I can generally run my case fans at a low rpm, since the case does have great air flow. However this is still something to keep in mind.

I bought this case for my step son. He loves it and is very excited about his new case. My only issue with it so far is that they do lie on the listing. It has an acrylic side panel, not tempered glass. Will be reporting the listing for false advertising.
"
Levi,5.0,2021 15 February,"
Super easy chassis to work with, great for cable management The standoffs and fans came pre-installed. Quality of product is nice and the airflow is awesome. Glad I went with this case cause it functions great and looks even better.
"
Coty Wheeler,5.0,2021 20 June,"
Excellent Product. Came right on time, and it was able to fit of my MSI and Corsair tech inside the whole case. would strongly recommend buy this case.
"
FLOFCT,3.0,2021 22 June,"
I bought 2 cases had to get them replaced RGB lights did not work in one and the other 2 very dim and one dead.The replacements worked for 6 months and LEDs stopped working.FYI if the leds don't work you have remove all the components and send it back, they will not send out replacement LEDS. very poor support. Not recommended
"
Ayrton Emil Sanchez,5.0,2020 24 July,"
This is a great case, it looks great and works perfectly, has great airflow and a lot of space for everything, for the price this is the best you can find. The only downside of this case is the dust filter for the power supply is just a cheap thin metallic layer can be lost easily.
"
Daniel Mateo,5.0,2021 13 July,"
Very good fans, the rgb looks very good, and the air preassure is correct, is big enough and have good wire system

Bought this CoolerMaster case to only find out that during assembly it did not fit my CoolerMaster MasterLiquid ML240L RGB V2? Would have assumed that all the CoolerMasters are compatible with each other so it took nearly 2-hours of improvisation for this to work. I used PC part picker as well!
"
Apex Azriel,5.0,2021 15 April,"
This case was easy.  Had good airflow and cable management design.  For a basic, 2021 computer component build it was stylish and provided a good form for both air and liquid cooling options.
"
Faith,5.0,2020 6 October,"
Guys, this will hold a fat coolermaster cpu cooler, and not even get close to touching the glass and a big motherboard, a rtx 2060 super 8GB OC. has bill and teds excellent adventure airflow from the front. If you also like rgbs on your fans, this is your tower!

 It was really easy to build in. I received this case in perfect condition with all of the hardware and paperwork included.I mounted the coolermaster rgb controller on the back of the case which made it easy for me to access.
"
Thoeuth Chum,3.0,2020 30 May,"
This TD500 Cooler Master Case Mesh is a very great case. It has a somewhat acceptable moderate amount of airflow, a little bit of rgb for your rig if it doesn't have it, and a decently large interior for a Mid-Tower case (In my opinion). Everything in this whole case seemed good so far until I switched it on for the very first time and found a small imperfection. One of the led's on the front panel fans didn't light up. It was a very minor mistake but somehow still irritates me. I know I could just replace it or return/ get a refund but I already assembled my computer, therefore I would not like to go through the process of disassembling it.
"
Anonymous Cool person,4.0,2020 30 September,"
This is amazing! It looks so cool and has great airflow. The only complaint I have, and is the reason I wrote this is because I ORDERED WHITE. I RECIEVED BLACK. WHY?!?!???!?!?
"
Brendan,4.0,2020 11 November,"
RGB didn’t work on the preinstalled fans so I had to wait another week for my fans to come in the mail to complete the build
"
Karmen ,5.0,2021 12 April,"
I love it <3 It did not come damaged maybe it's not a sender problem but a carrier prob because it was well protected (i dunno) But highly reccomend, air flow is excellent.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2021 22 January,"
Great starter case, however fans are a little loud...maybe due to poor quality bearings. Nonetheless happy with my purchase.
"
Carlos,4.0,2021 23 April,"
it's Great!
"
BradE17,4.0,2020 18 December,"
Quality case, doesn’t look as good in person...kind of cheesy. Other than that it has great airflow and cool looking fans.
"
Leo_10,5.0,2021 14 August,"
I love it, it looks and performs amazing. Thanks cooler master.
"
alonso29,4.0,2020 16 May,"
Good case for the price. Some of the flaws include the cheap quality dust filter for the power supply and the fans included. While not excessively loud by any means, the fans do make more noise than expected.
"
John Kusluski,5.0,2020 27 November,"
Very high quality pc case. By far the nicest I’ve ever built in. Comes with 4 fans already. My gpu and cpu are 10 degrees Celsius cooler than they were in my last case, and it looks good. Highly recommended.
"
River,4.0,2020 1 December,"
my only downfall with this case is one of my fans came broken and does not light up like it is supposed to
"
Nichole,5.0,2020 16 May,"
I looked at so many gaming cases and this one caught my eye. It has AMAZING cable managment creating a super clean look. The RGB is very bright and theres a button to change the color patern. Such a killer deal with the 3 fans included. IM TOTALLY IN LOVE AND SUCH A GREAT PRICE!!-GamerGirl

Landon Germino,4.0,2021 18 January,"
I love the product, but my case didn’t come with a proprietary cable for my chassis fans
"
Jeremy,5.0,2020 22 July,"
Loved building with this case! Spacious easy to navigate plenty of tie downs and routes for cable managment. Super easy & intuitive. Screws stay with the panel when you take of the sides so you can't lose them lol plenty of spare parts screws, ties, etc... 10/10 recommend
"
Christy,5.0,2020 5 November,"
It didn’t come damaged, very gorgeous, seems sturdy so far and airflow is nice! The only con is not much space for the cables in the back, had a hard time getting it to shut. Most importantly, my baby approves c:
"
Orlando MaRTINEZ,5.0,2020 11 September,"
I'm very happy with this case and have no complaints at all. There is plenty of space and the front fans are very nice. Cable management is easy as there is plenty of space. Overall case looks great and price is very fair.
"
Danielle GIl,5.0,2020 23 November,"
I love everything about this Case.  The color, the quality, the price, the fan lighting.  The airflow is perfect, and the mesh front is great. I couldnt ask for a better tower.  I recommend to anyone.
"
S1lence1,1.0,2022 21 September,"
This case has been horrible. The fan controllers dont work, theres zero space on the back panel for cables or ssd's. The front usb 3 ports work so slowly they arent worth using. This is a box with a power button and the mfgr doesnt respond to requests for help. DONT BUY IT!
"
Eli Kimball,5.0,2020 20 June,"
Finally decided to upgrade from my cramped  old tower. Couldn't be happier with my purchase.  The white is very sleek, tempered glass panel is easy to take off, and the back comes off as well for cable management. Tons of space for future hardware upgrades and additions.
"
Cody Clement,5.0,2021 4 June,"
Although the back panel was small when it came to wire management this was my first ever build and it looks amazing

"
KasprG,4.0,2020 30 September,"
Great case. Only wish I could see the psu. An opening to expose an rgb psu would get this case five stars.
"
Donald Green,5.0,2020 15 July,"
The space in the case is enough with a little extra. And plenty of air flows and fans in the right places. Highly recommend and totally worth. Im really happy with this investment and the people I hired to reassemble my PC for me also thought so too.
"
Rosendo Espinoza,5.0,2020 13 September,"
Great item, comes with 3 fans, not specified in item description but there it is. Comes in awesome packing, high quality and with alot of space inside. The magnetic mesh on top is very cool and keeps the dust away efficiently.
"
Paul,5.0,2020 23 October,"
Awesome case for the money! Excellent airflow and easy to work in.  Note: I did upgrade the fans and used the RGB controls off the mobo rather than the RGB controller that comes with the stock fans.
"
tanya,2.0,2022 29 April,"
I got the case today and a fan was not attached not sure if it’s broken but there are no screws to put it back on!
"
Gil,5.0,2020 23 October,"
Great case, Great quality, Great airflow, Great price!!! Easy to work in when putting together a my newest build. Best upgrade from an NZXT H510i. Plenty of room for any custom build you can think of.

"
Shona Lamond,5.0,2020 3 June,"
The case looks really good with, great airflow, good cable management, and plenty of space for all the radiators and fans you want. There's really nothing bad to say about it, if you're looking for a roomy ATX case with both functionality and aesthetics, this is it.
"
Jose Manuel Castro,5.0,2021 16 April,"

"
Roguestorm,5.0,2020 6 October,"
Bought this for my son for his gaming PC build. Nice, solid case and cool features. Only complaint is the small screen under the PSU comes off to easily. However, the glass side and fans/lights are awesome.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 23 May,"
Case is replacing a 10yr old box that had terrible air flow,  This case Is both beautiful and has great air flow.  Build was super easy, Radeon 5700XT  Red Devil fits with plenty room to spare.  overall I would highly recommend this case,

"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 27 October,"
I LOVE this case. Has so much room for activities and no issues installing parts or cable managing. Fits a nice big 2060 graphics card and the fans are great. The side is glass.
"
Alizay Adamson,5.0,2020 16 June,"
Looks exactly like the picture and even better in person. I plan on adding more ARGB fans but even with just the ones it has it looks great. I was easily able to hide cables and there's tons of room for upgrades. Highly recommend.
"
Aaronel Haro,5.0,2020 6 September,"
I chose this instead of lian li mesh one simply because it was available and it didn't disappoint. One of the best values in the $100 segment imo. Better than the fractify c mesh for sure tho.
"
ijpearson,5.0,2021 27 March,"

The case is quite large with a very roomy interior, makes building much easier. Plenty of routes for cable management as well.
"
Jonathan ,4.0,2020 11 July,"
Great case has amazing airflow, only downfall no case fan in the back only standard three rgb front fans.
"
Richard,3.0,2020 28 October,"
Everything is great and nice on this case it’s awesome and the glass panel design is sleek and stylish however it only has 2 USBs on the front I wish I’d have noticed this before I bought it. That’s the only shortcoming if that isn’t a big deal to u then you prolly won’t mind but I can’t see designing a case without at least 4 USBs in the front.
"
Shawn Tucker,5.0,2020 30 May,"
Second build. I found this case to be fantastic. It was easy to build in, fans were prewired and worked, and looks stunning in white.The glass side panel looks great with the etching, and makes lines really stand out.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 3 March,"
I really like the case tho but having not filter in the front it just make me a bit salty

"
Aidan,5.0,2020 23 October,"

"

"
Brandon,5.0,2021 8 March,"
Fits my 360mm Corsair iCUE H150i Elite Capellix on the top so long as there's no back fan.
"
Amazon Customer,2.0,2022 1 February,"
Bought this because it's supposed to allow for 280 rad on the roof. Could only fit rad on the front, Overall it's not a bad case but wouldn't have bought it knowing it wouldn't fit my radiator on the top.
"
Peter,5.0,2021 13 February,"

"
Destiny,3.0,2021 28 February,"
It was easy to assemble, but if you don't know a thing about wire management.. I suggest you learn. That's all this case allows. And where the power supply screws into the back it was dented, so I was only able to get two screws into the psu.
"
Butchee,5.0,2020 20 December,"
Nice and spacious. Able to fit 3 fan aio on top no issues. Wire management is solid. Fans are quite enough.
"
thunder,5.0,2020 15 October,"
The RGB was amazing, the cable management is exceptional, and the airflow is the best part. The design of the tempered glass was truly wonderful. 11/10
"
Crystal,3.0,2020 24 December,"
For my first pc build, I really liked this case. It’s a nice size and very pretty but there’s only one drawback, I didn’t receive the RGB controller that is supposed to come with this case. This case could have been a lot better if it came with the controller as it was supposed to
"
Luis Neris,3.0,2020 11 December,"
El case está muy lindo y es por su tamaño es fácil de trabajar en él. El problema es que llevo ya unas 3 semanas con él funcionando y los abanicos frontales están haciendo un ruido constante. El mismo se detiene cuando pongo la mano y hago algo de fuerza. Creo que deben estar algo sueltos.
"
Chew,4.0,2020 18 July,"
Good airflow. The supplied fans could be better but this case keeps things cool.
"

This item won't shut off, everything works, have to manually use power button to shut down.
"
Aaron,3.0,2020 8 July,"
Ordered a white one and they sent a black one instead. 3 RGB fans on the front, middle RGB fan doesn’t work.The color black has grown on me and the RGB fan I don’t care anymore since I plan on upgrading them in the future. Nevertheless, I’m not satisfied or happy with the transaction, and returning it is just an inconvenience.Plenty of room for installation and good airflow
"
Ronny V.,5.0,2020 13 July,"

steve kennedy,3.0,2020 28 July,"
Functional case. Fans are too slow. Horrible quality on the front I/O panel. I can actually connect a USB cable backwards with little to no trouble. Rest of the case is just cheap but I knew that. It does work but I am replacing the fans. I would get the Lancool 2 mesh over this. I have one  ordered.
"
Sean Sollars,5.0,2020 3 October,"

"
JEinPA,1.0,2021 17 October,"
My son waited to buy this bc the rate went into effect on 10/11. He likes the case. Got everything. Loved into it. Does not like that fan lights do not have more controls and can’t control them thru the computer but instead the attached control to them.Anyways, item came in a big cool matter box with all kids of marking and labels. Yet, there is no UPC  code on box anywhere, inside, out, under labels, anywhere! And you need to attach the original UPC and send along with form. Well if there isn’t one what do the want?? Looked online and found this has been an issue with others and they had no resolution. Not sure if I will get anywhere with support when I can call them next week, not holding my breath, but this is not ok. Do not buy if you want the rebate at this time.

Mariel,2.0,2020 21 September,"
This case is authentically gorgeous. I loved that it included the RGB fans built in already and I didn't have to pay for them as an add-on. I had extremely satisfied with this case until a couple of days ago when the power button stopped working out of the blue. I realized this after I spent several hours trying to figure out why my PC wouldn't turn on. It is a big disappointment because this case looks awesome and I thought CM was a reputable brand. Had to return it after waster over 12 hours with it.

Bri Guy,1.0,2021 29 March,"
Overall, I like this case. The only problem I had was unfortunately a big one...the RGB doesn't work properly on the fans. Only two of my fans light up, and these two look ""messed up"" (see image).I have contacted Cooler Master support multiple times, but they have not responded for over a month. What's worse is that my friend got the exact same case and is experiencing the exact same problem. At first, I assumed the fault was mine and that I just needed to fix the wiring, but after many hours, I was not able to fix the issue.It would be nice if I could at least get a response... unfortunately, I have to give this a negative review.Had to update my review to a one star because now my USB drives are dropping out too. Still no word from customer support... cool.

I ordered this case new from Amazon. And there I was waiting patiently for all the parts to arrive. Once all parts of build were there, I got so excited on a weekend night (Friday) to put my gaming desktop together. And guess what. I open the box of the casing, and there is the casing but no screws / standoffs, nothing to mount the motherboard with. The paper that came with the box showed that I am supposed to have the hardware with it, but no hardware at all. You can imagine the emotional roller coaster. And this was past 7 pm so if any local computer stores who would have carried the screw kit were closed. Well basically i got 'amazon balled' if you know what I mean. And on top of that after seeing the case, i was like this is NOT a 100 bucks case. This is more like 55 bucks case, as the material is very flimsy and the cable routing is horrible.

Troll Monger,2.0,2020 13 November,"
The biggest draw back for this case and why I wouldn't buy it again lies in the PSU shroud design. Very, very tight PSU design, spent countless hours trying to fit power connectors through holes. If you have a modular PSU with a decently sized GPU and CPU cooler, steer clear from this case, as you will pull your hair out trying to fit and connect things. Not worth the time or hassle as this price point.

Jason Roberts,1.0,2021 4 June,"
This may be a decent box, however, I haven't got the build complete. The three pin fan connector does not easily fit on the standard 4 pin fan header. I mangled 2 headers and the plug and still haven't got it hooked up. In fact, I wouldn't even know it was the fan plug if I didn't look it up on youtube. Instructions are garbage. Probably end up sending it back over the stupid fans, which according to reviews run full blast until you set them in the bios. I wouldn't know, they wont plug in. Either way it's just a BS set up for something that should be a no brainer plug and go.
"
Nicole,1.0,2021 19 May,"
DO NOT BUYFirst few months were fine and then everything started to break. USB ports in the front are wonky…I can deal with that but it’s annoying. And now my fans in the front started to break down. They make horrific noises even when the GPU is super low with no programs launched.Their support didn’t help. They told me that I should have emailed them earlier because now “I’m out of warranty” since I bought it 4 months ago. I told them my problems didn’t start until this week and they told me tough luck.Now I have to buy a brand new case and rebuild my pc. So annoyed.

"
Jhonathan,2.0,2021 16 January,"
The case in general is fantastic, but for some reason mine came with 3 very cheap front panels, the RGB didnt worked + they were made from very cheap plastic and also one of them was not even screw in the case it was hold by plastic sticks.

Upgraded my case to this. Plug everything in turn on not posting. Debug error says cpu. After a few hours of trouble shooting I finally unplugged the hd audio and bam it posted. So I’m thinking the HD audio circuit board or cord has a short and shorting the board out. Not happy with it but I don’t need the audio or mic jacks in the front.  So beware if you have this error try pulling that HD audio.
"

"
Robles Junior,1.0,2020 18 September,"
I've had this case for 3 months now and I am disappointed in the quality of the fans. They are loud and buzzy. I contacted the seller to send it back for a replacement but they said to contact the manufacturer. That's unfair as they were the ones who sold it to me not Coolermaster. Regardless, they are the sellers and need to replace parts or products as need be.The fans suck but they look good. The case overall is great. I am leaving the one star due to the customer support I received, the loud fans and the bent USB Port on the front.
"
Bo Yang,2.0,2020 30 June,"
The fans are sooooooo noisy. I have to unplug the fan power but just keeps the led on.Not bother to return it as I would have to go through all those again.The noisy is quite disrupting, totally unacceptable.Even the GPU's fans at full speed is better than those three fans,

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 one of the fans was making a very faint noise out of the box and after the first week it was very loud and I didn’t want to disassemble everything in my build to return it. I wished I had returned it straight away. Also the mesh is what you see in the picture and not the fine kind that will catch dust (It’ll catch a rice grain but not lint/dust)Listen to your fans, before assembling your build.

Missing all screws to mount motherboard upon arrival. Quite a pain when you’ve got a kid excited to build his first computer on Christmas Day. Case itself seems fine.
"
Sean Staake,2.0,2020 19 September,"
selling this product without the controller needed to adjust the rgb settings is absolutely dumb. now im getting a case that appears to look amazing yet without said controller its an awful yellow light on the fans.
"
David S.,1.0,2020 14 December,"
Honestly, if it's at MSRP I would consider this case at all. Three out of Nine Motherboard Standoff Screws were stripped, I couldn't remove it after screwing them once unless I used a piler to secure the back side. VERY frustrating experience. Also the rear side of the case is a bit tie, if you have run a lot of power cables to the back or a RBG hub. It won't close at all. I am using M.2 I don't think it would close with 2.5 SSD.
"
Llocsird'o Ttam,1.0,2022 30 January,"
The headphone jack on the front does not connect(the microphone does). I have tested my headphones on another jack on a different computer (same motherboard) and they work fine. All drivers are up to date, the jack is simply dead on arrival.

Upon arrival and after speaking with a representative at Amazon through chat, I was told to contact Coolermaster.com and to inform them directly about product. Two of the three front panel fans led lighting are not working. I was unable to contact anyone on the website and am not happy to have paid for a defective tower. :( Beware!
"
Not A Hacker,1.0,2020 6 June,"
Metal case around power supply and hard drives make it impossible to actually hook anything in. The wires that are already hooked up aren't labeled at all so unless you know exactly what you're doing you're screwed. I'd send it back if there were any quick replacements. DO NOT BUY THIS. I've literally never seen another case with this blockage, makes.ot impossible to snuggly fit any cables into.
"
Bryan P,4.0,2022 23 May,"
Very nice looking case with great airflow. However, I have to dock a star for a couple flaws.1. As others have pointed out, the back side doesn’t leave much room for cable management2. The top feels too low, to the point where if you have a radiator on the top of the case, you will need a slim fan because a normal one won’t fit next to the RAM (see picture)
"
Anthony Moser,1.0,2020 27 June,"
Item arrived damaged. The top section was dented in when I opened the box. As well as the area around where the power supply is installed. Didn't see any damage on the box. Very disappointed as I was excited to build a new PC for my girlfriend with this case.

This case comes with terrible install instructions. A word of caution, the case has no location for  a DVD Drive. so the mother board comes with a DVD to install drivers. You have to hook up a DVD on the outside of the case to install the motherboard.

After assembling my PC build, everything except the case worked. The power button and LED were defective. After spending the day constructing a build and then the case messing up is annoying. Amazon recommends going through manufacturer if any issues come up so that you use the warranty expect a delay.

Joey motter,5.0,2021 29 November,"
The temps of pc components are outstanding. The mesh design of the case with the provided fans works well. Add one more fan for some more evenly distributed airflow and you will be very satisfied. The looks are great, its very aesthetically pleasing. The case is very easy to build in, decent cable routing, and plenty of space. As with any products there are some manufacturing defect for some products, but I haven't seen any myself, so of course your mileage may vary. I can solidly recommend this case to anyone looking for a mid tower, ATX case with good airflow, and great looks.

don’t expect the rgb fans to work at this good of a price. the glass is beautiful and case is 10/10 with very nice material & easy to remove panels. great buy, just replace the rgb fans :)) fans don’t spin at all and the rgb on the fans doesn’t light up. overall if you’re looking at it, and are building on a budget, look no further, great buy.
"

My first build, installation instructions could've been written better, wish there was a little more room for cable management, but the case design itself is beautiful, lots of airflow, and overall just a super fun good product for what you pay.Case arrived in a timely manner, and product waa not damaged!
"
Jennie,3.0,2021 27 January,"
As I mentioned on this review title and as you can see on the picture I uploaded, the only thing to complain is the first fan is not operating well. Therefore, I did not give it a 5 star.After I assembled my desktop computer, it worked fine at the first couple hours and then it stopped working. I had tried to check all of the cables and wires, and they all worked well and connected well. Then, I tried to use a pen to give it a force, and the fan would start to spin again. Several hours later, it stopped again, and I had to open the case and use the pen to force it to spin again. I repeated this process over and over again. Finally, it ended up with being tired to do it to make it operate, and I gave up.I am not 100% satisfied on this desktop case, I did not return it for a refund for two reasons:1. It's so heavy and it's inconvenient for a return.2. I spent an entire two days to assemble my desktop computer before I found out the fan was not operating properly. Therefore, it's not worth for a return, and I will let it go.
"
Sherri L Williams,3.0,2020 8 December,"
Overall the case is nice but it has one serious drawback and another issue..... Managing cables for larger power supplies that do not have flat cables (even fully modular ones) with the hard drive bay installed is a NIGHTMARE! The case switch button broke after only a few weeks of use. I had to super glue it back into place because the switch button is cheap plastic that is thermally attached. The fans look great, there were no sharp edges anywhere in the case, the tempered glass is beautiful if you want to show off a nice build. Overall I give this 3 out of 5 stars!
"
Zachary Cobb,2.0,2021 9 March,"
Let me start off by saying that I genuinely LOVE this case!  It was easy to build in for a first-timer and it looks amazing in my opinion!  The problem is the fans/fan hub that came with my example.  I purchased the TD500 Mesh, which states that it INCLUDES three ARGB 120mm fans and an ASUS Aura compatible ARGB fan hub.  The product gallery also includes photos of the newer mini-ARGB controller from Cooler Master.  What I received were 3 unmarked ARGB fans and an older, simpler-looking fan hub controller that only has one button to control the color of the fans.  I purchased this case specifically because it was supposed to include 3 ARGB fans and a fan controller that works with Aura Sync, and that is not what was included with my case.  The fans are ARGB, but only offer 14 basic lighting options.I LOVE the case and the fans function as any other ARGB fan would, but they are NOT Aura compatible, and that is the only reason that I'm even writing a review.  Save your money and buy another case you like for $60, then spend the other $40 on a 3+ pack of 3rd party fans with a decent controller.

"
Anh,1.0,2020 23 June,"
Fans and controllers were broken. The fans didn't light up at all. I guess Cooler Master just kind of forgot about implementing any kind of quality control. What makes this even worse is how Cooler Master's support has not responded to my support ticket for a month now because their ticketing system is broken. This wouldn't be a big deal if there were other avenues to get support, but there are none. Cooler Master will not answer phone calls, so I am just left with a broken controller and three useless fans.
"
Caroline Lin,1.0,2020 2 October,"
Maybe I'm just unlucky but I always have problems with the audio jacks. My last cooler master case's microphone jack didn't work right out of the box.  I checked all the front panel connectors and even swapped out my motherboard.  When I got this case the audio jack didn't work and again I checked my front panel connectors and they were all in the right spot.
"
CF,5.0,2020 23 November,"
Got this to host my new AMD build, after 8 years on a Dell intel.So far it is great; there is a big glass window but I don't care, since it sits on the bottom of my desk. The cable management is great; and you can build with confidence that your cables are out of the way and tucked correctly. What is missing is some supports for SATA SSD; I had to improvise to install those; but nothing too hard.The fans in the front have a large airflow; the only downside is the top: the flimsy magnetic grille is moving easily as soon as you touch the top or put something on it; I would rather prefer a static grille like the front one; not sure why they made that magnetic grille.
"
Mr. M,5.0,2020 17 October,"
Not a great photo, and it's still a build in progress, but I really love this case.  No issues or defects, but I do agree with other's that the cover for the PSU feels pretty cheap compared to the rest of the unit.  The directions aren't the best, but if you can follow pictures, you will figure it out.  Keep in mind arrow = positive (had to look that up).  Wire management was a HUGE improvement from my older case, so for me this was just a great case overall.  Only wish it had Razor Chroma integration like the Coolmaster Wraith Prism that came with my processor.

 Not a bad case but they did cheap out on some stuff to get it to this price point but solid for first time builder and it actually looks pretty good. Do note you will not be able to fit a 280mm radiator on top with some ram types. That was the most disappointing thing for me I really wanted to mount my radiator on top but it wasn’t fitting due to my ram size. But it was easy to take the front off and replace the front fans with the radiator fans and putting it all back together I was really surprised by this and it’s nice to know cleaning it will be a breeze.
"
T. Orna,4.0,2021 5 January,"
Overall, the case is very nice.  This was my first time building a PC, and everything went smoothly.  I like how the USB and Audio ports on this case are angled on the top so you can reach them easier.  The case is large enough to fit big CPU coolers like the Dark Rock Pro 4 I have in mine.  The only downside is the front 3 case fans that are provided are not totally quiet.  There is a constant hum.  I can only hear it if the room is quiet, so it isn't impossible to live with, but it is the reason for a 4-star review instead of 5.  Overall, I'd probably buy this case again, but you may want to consider replacing the front fans with premium ones if total silence is important to you.
"
Edward S Cox,5.0,2020 25 September,"
I used this case for my first build, it was very easy to assemble. I was kind of shocked how easy it was, I don't know if it was this case that made so easy or that I had it built up in my mind it would be hard. Anyways I have a total of 6 fans in this case and never is this case hot! I am playing games at highest setting and my temp levels are still at normal. It looks so cool as well. I'm not one of the gamers that has to have their computer lit up so you can see inside, but the lights in the front around the 3 front fans has some cool light combinations. The tempered Glass side is very durable and made out of quality product. If you are looking for a case that has amazing ventilation, super easy to assemble, amazing cord management and that looks and cool, buy this one.

This case is phenomenal, an excellent purchase, white color gives you the opportunity to create something different from the conventional black case.Pros:-. Large size for a Mid-Tower.-. ATX plate fits perfectly without problem.-. Includes 3 Cooler Fan 120 Airflow ARGB, which generate a good airflow.-. Cable management is comfortable and with enough holes to pass them.-. Includes a mini hub to control the 3 Fan Cooler Included.-. Tempered glass is excellent with fractal details.-. Includes two internal bays for 2.5"" or 3.2"" drives.-. Supports 4 2.5"" drives installed on the back or front, using included rubber mounts.Cons:-. They only include rubber support to install two 2.5"" disks, if you want to install more you must locate some rubber bands similar to those included since they are not sold as accessories.-. The bottom mesh ( PSU ) comes off easily, does not have large fasteners and is not magnetic.Note : In my case I used 4 small neodymium magnets to hold the mesh securely.

Kane,5.0,2022 6 October,"
When i was looking for a case my criteria were mostly: cheap, chonky, and customizable. I was really trying to find one that could easily be taken apart for painting and this one was perfect! you can almost completely disassemble it! I was able to paint every part of it just the way i wanted to and it holds all the fans i wanted to put in it! you can get 3 fans on the top and front and one in the back : ) plenty of room for a 360 AIO and i think it holds maybe two or three of the big hard drives? the only place its lacking in space for me is where the cables go in the back, the back panel sits so close that im not able to get it on cause of how chunky my power supply cables are : ( other than that its absolutely perfect!

First off I'm not going to complain much considering we were looking for a cheap case with some fans. And that's what this is. The build quality is good but not stellar. It looks good and holds all we want. Probably the complaint is the fan RGB setup. They are connected to a push-button cool master controller that you cannot get outside the case. So you have to open the panel to click through the colors you want then put the glass back on. Pain in the butt. I would recommend undoing it all and going into the motherboard direct or get an RGB fan controller and plug them in that way. That's probably what we will do. Or buy a cheaper case and spend the difference on some good fans. But overall they run well, fast and quiet. It works as advertised. We had no sizing issues of installing components etc.

Absolutely beautiful! Sturdy, durable!I love the fans in front also ! It looks so pastel with the mesh ! Love love love !

I came completely for the look of the case, it is beautiful. But here's some cons. First, the material can be better, I mean, just a magnetic duster on top is bad. Second, the back of the case can be a little more spacey, a thick cable for MB power can take up the whole space. And last but not least, it would be better if there's a plate for the motherboard connections. I have a prime z690 and there is a huge opening for my motherboard connection where something like hair or dust can easily get inside.

The glass panel came with protective wrap on it and the computer was cased snugly in styrofoam. It was easy to set up and everything fit perfectly. The fans provide extra circulation and the RGBs really add to the ambiance of the setup.

This case is roomy, easy to work in and has excellent cooling capability. Seller had it on the way immediately as a plus.Slapped a 360mm radiator in it and a behemoth RTX 3060 card inside. Really showroom glass build perfect for those spendy little light shows you bolt inside your P.C. I think I spend as much time staring @ P.C. as I do monitor.  More than I expected, Very clean nice build foundation.
"
Christopher McGill,5.0,2021 5 April,"
I needed something with a lot of room, it’s great. The fans it comes with are supper thin and cheap and are through aways, and the front ventilation is cheaply made. But other then that is perfect.
"
Matthew Perry,5.0,2022 21 February,"
I loved this case, keep in mind that you need to buy 3 extra fans. I had their liquid cooler so I just needed one extra fan and I was set!  great case.
"
Carmelo Ildefonso,5.0,2021 15 March,"
For $100, this is really one of the best and nicest looking airflow cases on the market. I've built three different PCs with this case and there are images of two of them here. It comes with three pre-installed ARGB fans and has plenty of room for all kinds of cooling possibilities. The front panel mesh and the magnetic dust filter on top keep this system nice and clean inside, and the engraved tinted glass side panel looks really nice with the right lighting, with plenty of room in the back panel for cable management and extra accessories. There's also a dust filter for the PSU that's a little hard to put on and keep in place, but once in place, does its job perfectly. Obviously it supports a ton of radiator space for liquid cooling and there's even a company that makes a custom distribution plate that I could have used here. It might not be mentioned a whole lot on Internet reviews but I think the TD500 Mesh is destined to be an instant classic for first-time liquid coolers and regular builders alike.

Lou Pell,5.0,2021 13 September,"
Buying a case for my new build was probably the hardest decision I had to make.  There are so many great cases out there, especially at this price point.  Ultimately, I went with the Cooler Master TD500 Mesh because it included 3 front intake ARGB fans but also because I really liked the look of it.  It wasn't over the top but had enough visual flair to make it look rugged and stylish all at the same time.  I love the tempered glass side-panel, and the mesh front looks fantastic while appearing to provide great airflow.  It is also a breeze to remove dust from the front of the case.  The underneath dust filter for the PSU leaves something to be desired however and is probably the worse thing about this case.  It is very flimsy and annoying to work with.  A magnetic dust cover would have been nice.  An included ARGB and PWM fan hub would have been nice also as I ordered one separately from Cooler Master.  It only cost me around 17 dollars though.  Overall, a great case and I am glad I went with it.  I would most definitely recommend it to anyone looking to build a quality PC but doesn't want to stretch their budget towards 150 or more.  I paid this case around 110.  I believe it should retail for around 100 dollars but I have seen it go for more online, even Amazon.

 Purchased 'Used - Very good' and the case was literally brand new - never used. That is what has me the most impressed. Though, the case is very nice as well. Came with controller which I was unsure whether I was going to receive or not. Only my second gaming case so I can't compare it to anything else. The quality is very nice. 10/10 overall thus far.EDIT: Still love the case, but it claims to be able to mount an AIO ""Up to 360"" on the top. Trying to mount an AIO on top will result in RAM and the radiator touching.

Couldn't get motherboard installed with radiator in case ram modules were too rall and heat sinks on an asus  maximus xiii were too  tall too, took radiator off installed motherboard then radiator fit although no clearance between fans and components, would have to completely disassemble to add memory case needs to be about 2 inches taller, even without radiator screw holes didn't line up well with case mounting points not conformining to ATX  form factor verywell. Would be an impresivecaseif this fit better

Great case its big enough for everything and well designed. The case fans work with the armory app and are quite. No usb type c on the front, but it does have two usb 3.0 and headset mic ports. Nice tempered glass case thats easy to remove.
"
Emmanuel,5.0,2021 24 May,"
I got this tower after seeing how nice the case looks, did not disappoint! There is mesh everywhere! At the front, above, and below. So airflow is one of the best out there. Enough space in the case to support my 3090 as well. In the back it was also pretty easy to use for cable management, I wish there was a bit more space, but when compared to other cases, I can't complain. This also comes with 3 front case fans, but I threw those away to be replaced with some corsair ones instead. Highly recommend! Especially if you're a very strong believer in airflow
"
Abdul-Basit Nambiema ,5.0,2021 24 February,"
Color, quality and ease of use is fantastic. Cable management depends on how good the user does it and it has 3 more spots for system cooling fans.
"
D. Orders,5.0,2022 21 May,"
Really like this case. Some have said the power supply was blocked by the drive cages, which is true but they are not needed and easily removable. There are mounts for 2 SSD's in the main case and you might be using NVMe drives anyway. Some pluses, all the screw posts for a full size ATX board are already installed and every bit of hardware you might want is included. A couple very minor negs, no PC speaker is included (you can get a half dozen for less than $10) and the manual is tiny and hard to read (download the PDF copy which is easy to read and navigate). Last, while 3 front fans are included, there is ample room for 3 more on the top and one in the back that are not. Seems like in a full size ATX case at least the rear fan would be included.As noted in the title there are no front drive bays but with external DVD drives less than $20 and all software downloadable I'm not sure why you would want one.

 Un excelente case, hice upgrade de mi viejo case de poco más de 10 años en donde me era prácticamente imposible hacer algo de cable management. Con este case de Cooler Master fue sumamente sencillo hacerlo, trae todo lo necesario en accesorios para habilitar RGB y los ventiladores, tiene dos USB 3.1 frontales y HD audio, así como los botones de encendido y reinicio.Pase varios días viendo reseñas y todas decían cosas muy buenas de este modelo y por el precio se me hizo un win-win, la mejor reseña es la de Gamers Nexus.Por fin un build limpio sin cablerío en el frente :D!!El panel lateral de vidrio templado le da un aspecto increíble con las marcas que coinciden con el mesh frontal, el cuál es único y se ve genial.Es un deleite verlo en acción, además que la ventilación es increíble, solo venía con 3 ventiladores frontales RGB pero no tuve problema ya que contaba con 4 PWM Artic de 120 mm así que puse uno en la parte trasera y 3 arriba, debo decir que bajaron considerablemente mis temperaturas al jugar o minar bitcoins, unos 10 grados celcius en promedio.Llevo un par de semanas usándolo y debo decir que los filtros de polvo hacen un buen trabajo, recientemente tuve que abrirlo de nuevo para re acomodar los cables de la GPU (usaba 1 cable con adaptador de 2 salidas y decidí colocar 2 ya que mi GPU usa 2 de 8-pines c/u y vi que reducía el calor en el cable y mejoraba rendimiento) y el polvo dentro era prácticamente imperceptible, eso sí afuera si hay que estar limpiándolo constantemente, es un precio que pagar por una excelente ventilación.La fuente de poder se coloca en la parte de abajo y yo recomiendo que la coloquen con el ventilador hacia abajo, tiene mucho espacio, solo no pongan su computadora sobre una alfombra... cuenta con filtro de polvo en la parte de abajo también.El filtro de arriba es magnético así que es sumamente práctico y sencillo el proceso de limpieza, el del panel frontal se puede retirar con cierta facilidad para hacer mantenimiento también.Le puse 3 SSD SATA sin mayor problema, trae espacio para 4 pero también trae bahía para discos mecánicos que igual se pueden montar SSD ahí.Llegó antes de la fecha programada y en excelente estado.

Ho scelto il modello TD500 Mesh Nero📋 ⭐Descrizione del Prodotto⭐ :E' il solito buon prodotto CoolerMaster dal prezzo leggermente sopra la mediama più per il nome che per altro,comunque nel suo insieme è un ottimo case sesiete amanti del brand e del suo design classico ma ricercato.I punti di forza per la mia esperienza sono:✅Frontale Mesh diverso dal solito✅Filtro per l'alimentatore removibile✅Può montare al top radiatori da 360mm✅Spazio in abbondanza per qualsiasi configurazione✅Si possono installare fino a quattro SSD e due HDD✅Filtro magnetico e removibile al top di buona qualità✅Vetro temperato con bellissimi tagli stilosi e d'effetto✅Gommini anti vibrazione già applicati per l'alimentatore✅Gli slot pci-e sono removibili con viti senza spezzare nulla✅Spazio posteriore buono per un discreto cable management✅Accetta qualsiasi scheda video anche di dimensioni molto generose✅Accetta qualsiasi scheda madre:Mini ITX,Micro ATX,ATX,SSI CEB,E-ATX✅Piedini inferiori di dimensioni generose che danno stabilità al case✅Cavi interni di buona qualità e lunghi il giusto per un lavoro pulito✅Spazio in abbondanza tra un dissipatore passivo anche generoso e il vetro✅Frontale mesh staccabile e anche lavabile ma meglio usare l'aria compressa✅Sistema di ancoraggio degli SSD pratico e veloce attraverso dei gommini morbidi✅Tre ventole frontali ARGB con controller incluso e possibilità di comandarle col tasto reset✅Copertura generosa per l'alimentatore e drive HDD con finestra per vedere il marchio del PSU✅Ottima verniciatura interna che non si scheggia se si urta per errore con utensili in ferroCosa non mi è piaciuto:❌Le tre ventole ARGB non sono PWM❌Non inclusa in confezione la ventola da 120mm al posteriore❌La copertura del PSU e dei cestelli degli HDD non è removibile❌Pannello lamierato destro più economico rispetto ai passati modelli❌Il filtro dell'alimentatore è un fazolettino retinato da 2 centesimi e si fissa nelle guide di metallo❌Si sente la mancanza di una porta USB-C sul frontale (ne ha due USB 3.0 e i due spinotti per cuffie e mic)❌Se si monta un radiatore al top,2 centimetri in più in altezza avrebbero agevolato la rimozione delle ram❌La bustina degli accessori ha solo i gommini per due SSD,per gli altri due si deve comprare un kit a parte📦 ⭐Confezione⭐ :Il cartonato che accoglie il case è di dimensioni generose e ben imbottito di polistirolo,il case è copertoda una busta in plastica,a corredo c'è il manuale d'uso e la bustina con gli accessori tra cui il controller🚚 ⭐Spedizione⭐ :A cura di Amazon,quindi rapida,sicura e conforme agli standard dell'azienda.📉📈 ⭐Considerazioni finali⭐ :Personalmente a me piace,è un mix tra linee classiche e spazio in abbondanza per configurazioni esigenti,non strizza l'occhio ai modder o amanti degli RGB se non nelle sole ventole frontali,tutto il resto è sìapplicabile ma da comprare a parte,volendo con un pò di pazienza e pianificazione è possibile montare anchefrontalmente radiatori fino a 360mm,la copertura del PSU rivettata e non removibile vi costringerà apianificare bene i passaggi dei cavi dell'alimentazione se avrete molte periferiche da installare,posteriormente lo spazio non abbonda ma non è neanche troppo risicato,con un pò di destrezza si riesce afare un buon cable management e se proprio non riesce bene alla fine il pannello copre eventuali errori.Io ci ho infilato: una scheda madre ATX,4 banchi di ram ARGB ballistix,AIO da 360mm,una RTX 3080,due SSDe due HDD,più una ventola al posteriore riciclata dal precedente case sempre cooler master,il risultato perle mie esigenze,pur potendo fare di meglio con un pò di tempo in più,è più che accettabile,per configurazionipiù ""light"" non dovrebbero esserci difficoltà per il discorso dello spazio in abbondanza.La validità o meno di questo case oltre al fattore ""piace o non piace"" è strettamente legato al prezzodi vendita,spesso si trova,almeno il modello nero meshato sugli 89 euro o anche a qualche euro in menoe a questo prezzo è a mio avviso un buon acquisto,sopra questa cifra mettendoci poca differenza 15/20€si trova di meglio,di più moderno,più grande(se se ne sente la necessità)e più completo.Per i motivi sopra descritti il mio voto personale è di ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ stelle.La mia scala di voto è così definita:⭐️ stella prodotto da evitare⭐️⭐️ stelle prodotto insufficiente,⭐️⭐️⭐️ stelle prodotto sufficiente,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ stelle prodotto buono,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ stelle prodotto ottimo.Se avete trovato la recensione utile e i punti da me evidenziati trovanoriscontro con i vostri gusti personali è sicuramente un prodotto da tenerein considerazione per i vostri acquisti.Come mia abitudine se dovessi rilevare anomalie o difetti nelbreve o lungo periodo sarà mia cura portarveli a conoscenza,modificare questa recensione e relativo voto finale.

Es un excelente gabinete.En cuanto al diseño es perfecta, todo está muy bien pensado para realizar un manejo de cables impecable, los slots de HDD y SSD son bastante prácticos. Y el espacio y tamaño es perfecto para incluir hasta una bomba de enfriamiento líquido costumizado.En cuando al producto por el exterior, es realmente bonito, el cristal templado y el material es de muy buena calidad lo que igualmente ayuda a tener una disipación correcta de calor.La regilla ""mesh"" de la parte fronal aporta mucha entrada de aire y lo mejor es que el equipo si está muy bien protegido del pelo y polvo.Actualmente tengo 2 mascotas y tenía que retirar pelo y polvo del equipo cada mes, ya que realmente se llenaba de conejos de pelo atascado, y ahora con este gabinete el pelo lo retiro solo de las regillas, ya que por el interior todo sigue bastante limpio.Por lo que es un muy buen agregado este frente ""mesh"" en comparación a la versión normal que tenía un cristar al frente.Quede muy feliz con mi compra.

My first build, done in 45 mins.This case is incredibly well designed, cable management is a breeze with it and everything aligned perfectly.Looks great too.Comes with the three fans in the front pre-installed and comes ready to plug straight into you MB.My only niggle is that is doesn't come with a rear exhaust fan, but I just picked another Cooler Master ARBG fan from Amazon, no drama, would have just been nice to be included.The glass - 4mm thick tempered glass! No worries of it being smashed easily like a lot of the cheap cases.For what it is, it's a great price. I would have happily paid 50% more for this.Definitely recommend

 Cercherò di descrive al meglio quelle che sono le mie impressioni ad una decina di giorni circa di utilizzo.Parto dicendo che la spedizione è stata abbastanza veloce ma questo credo dipenda più dal negozio che da altro.Dimensioni veramente generose per questo case, finalmente un case dove non si sia costretti a vedere il proprio hardware tutto striminzito in spazi angusti. Ce ne sono altri, certo, ma costano di più!!In questo case infatti è possibile montare in top un radiatore da 360mm, in effetti il mio è anche più lungo (400 mm ) e ci sta perfettamente. Vi posso assicurare che questa cosa non è affatto comune in case di questa fascia di prezzo.Trovo che il suo design sia assolutamente fantastico. La parte frontale con il suo motivo poligonale unita alle 3 ventole argb donano un look veramente accattivante.  Il pannello laterale in vetro temperato invece ha delle scanalature veramente ben fatte che danno un senso di movimento che onestamente apprezzo veramente tanto.  Chicca che ho apprezzato veramente tanto è il logo della casa in metallo sul frontale che ricade perfettamente nel centro della ventola posizionata in basso. Al tatto è stupendo questo logo.Il pannello frontale è dotato di due porte usb 3.0 un tasto reset due jack per cuffie e microfono ed il tasto di accensione esagonale bellissimo che il cui feedback alla pressione non mi piace affatto.Case che secondo me permette al flusso di aria di circolare perfettamente. Infatti a dispetto del mio vecchio case noto temperature più basse anche di 3 o 4 gradi.Questo case supporta schede madre di dimensioni ATX e mATX.Arriva dotato di un filtro magnetico anti-polvere sulla parte superiore ed uno non magnetico montato nella parte inferiore (dove si trova l’alimentatore) che trovo un po' scomodo ma nemmeno più di tanto dato che non ci si mette mani praticamente mai.Un’altra cosa che mi è piaciuta particolarmente di questo case è che le feritoie dalle quali passano i cavi provenienti dal retro sono dotati di copertura, cosa che trovo veramente carina e assolutamente inaccettabile che in case di questa fascia di prezzo non siano presenti ( cosa che accade fin troppo spesso).Nella parte inferiore della scheda madre i fori per far passare i cavi sono 2, posso assicurarvi che rendono il passare dei cavi molto agevole rispetto a case che ne hanno uno solo.Lo spazio sul retro è abbastanza ampio da permettere il passaggio dei cavi senza particolari difficoltà a patto che abbiate montato tutto con un minimo di attenzione.Sempre nel case troviamo un alloggio per 2 dischi di archiviazione compatibile con dischi sia da 2.5 che da 3.5 pollici. E’ ovviamente possibile montare altri dischi 2.5 pollici anche sulla parte posteriore del case.Le 3 ventole in dotazione, tutte argb e comandabili via software,  mi sembrano delle buone. Tutte pwm (4pin) molto silenziose a bassi e medi regimi e devo dire che spingono bene l’aria.Mi sarebbe piaciuto solamente che il vetro temperato fosse scuro, sarebbe stato veramente il top per me.Mi sento soddisfatto da questo acquisto e lo consiglio anche perché a questo prezzo (95 quando l’ho preso io) è difficile riuscire a trovare di meglio secondo me.Vi allego un po' di foto a fin che possiate giudicare voi stessi per quanto possibile farlo per mezzo di foto.Perdonatemi se non sono proprio di qualità eccellente però :(Se questa mia recensione vi è stata utile a chiarire qualche perplessità battetemi un like, è una cosa che mi fa piacere 😊

Attualmente ho dentro una 3080 TI e raffreddamento a liquido per la CPU. Essendo non molto alto ho dovuto mettere il radiatore dietro le ventole anteriori il che limita un po' l'airflow e il calore stagna un po' sotto la gpu che cmq sta a 70 gradi in 4k mentre la CPU sta attorno i 40.

I've read through the reviews and the negative comments referring to cheap build quality are mostly because of USER ERROR, its made in china...what do you expect for 130 bucks? you will strip/crossthread screws if you aren't careful, you must have a light touch, if these guys had experience working with tools, and tinkering, there would be no issues...I've encountered none so far, just note the chinese threads in the standoffs, like I said be gentleA 240mm rad fits perfectly on top, someone had an issue here and blamed it on the case... id confidently say that you can fit a 360mm up top as well...there is just enough room with my Z490 GE Wif and trident G skill DDR4, there are 3 concave rails running along the top of the case, 1 rail closest to the back cover is for 120 mm rads, the other 2 rails are for 240 and 360mms, it is a little tight to the fans however it fits fine, if anyone else has a problem its no big deal, get a file and remove enough material on the fan shroud for fitment, files work one way also don't put pressure on the backwards strokeAs for the stock fans, I did some quick research on reddit, cooler master sent an email to someone saying the fans aren't sold retail and its closest the MF120R A RGB, which you can get in a 3 pack.  some of the stock fans have been reported to have a ticking noise, some not, sometimes its a gamble with manufacturing. They are weak fans, so changing them out would be a good future upgradeOverall I like the case, cable management is a little roughEDIT 1: I assembled the case and managed the wires, minus the GPU because well you all know.., but it came out great cable management is a little rough but look at it this way, your next case will prob have better cable management so you'll be good at it, this is a good case for beginners who want a dope looking case that has good coolingTIPS: -try to avoid zip/cable ties, use twist ties or Velcro straps your pc doesn't go down the road lol-USE PC PART PICKER.COM (top right corner switch to Canada)EDIT 2: Oct 2nd 2021spec list-MB- MSI z490 GE WIFIRAM- 16gb trident G skill RGB CL-16 3200AIO- H100x corsair ""240mm"" (skinnier than real 240mm)SSD- Samsung QVO 1TBCPU- I5-10600KFGPU- 3060 Zotac twin edgeDuring a CPU stress test at 100% usage max temp was 60 C, on idle its about 29 CGPU on idle runs 28 C with 1320 rpm (60%) fan speedThe front case fans are ok, no noises, but I can tell they are weak

Pros:1> The airflow is decent and coming with 3 front fans is really nice.2> The RGB comes with adapters for the different types. Only preset patterns though.3> Big and fits all the common parts properly. 320mm GPU fits quite easily. No comment on radiator support since I don't use those.Cons:1> The screws aren't well made to size and about 70% of them were really difficult to screw into the motherboard standoff screws.At one point, my case was rattling when I turned it on and after a lot of troubleshooting, I found out that I hadn't screwed in one of the motherboard screws all the way. You might think that's just my mistake, but this happened because it was extremely tough to tighten the screw further than I had already screwed in. I seriously doubt I'll be getting that screw out later without the motherboard standoff coming off with it.2> The front panel feels a bit cheap and is not completely tight so it creaks when you push it around a bit.3> Some of the motherboard standoff screws were over/under tightened. Some just weren't tightened enough so I just tightened them myself and that fixed that. However, 2 of them would spin in their hole when you tried to put a screw in them, so I had to hold them in place with pliers while unscrewing to get the screw out of it. Luckily, they were on the side with space beside the motherboard, otherwise I might not have been able to remove the motherboard without breaking something.4> As noted in Gamers Nexus' review on Youtube, the bottom front fan doesn't use normal fan screws so it was extremely difficult to replace it with a third-party fan.I would not recommend this case over the similarly priced Phanteks P400A RGB. It's actually unbelievable how much better built the Phanteks case feels in comparison to this Cooler Master case.

Pros:- Fairly sturdy- 3 included (rgb) fans- Three dust filters (including removable front panel)- Decent room for cables and routing in the back of the case- Mounts for 4 SSD and 2 HDD (or 6 SSD)- Option to remove HDD tray to allow more room for longer PSUCons:- Top radiator support is iffy unless mounting a 120mm cooler, minimal space between top of motherboard and ceiling of case- Bottom PSU dust filter is cheap and easy to damage- My case came with two motherboard standoffs already stripped, had to replace themOverall my experience has been great and I personally love the looks of this case and I think the price is definitely worth what you get. Mounted my 240mm rad in the front due to the struggle of space up top.

Me gustó mucho éste gabinete porque tiene una  excelente ventilación, cuenta con 2 compartimentos para guardar todo el cablerío, uno en el lateral y otro abajo en donde va la fuente de poder además de una ventana en la parte del procesador que facilita mucho instalar un enfriamiento líquido o de torre.Es muy espacioso, ya incluye 3 ventiladores con rgb en el panel frontal y tiene espacio hasta para un radiador de 3 ventiladores en la parte de arriba y otro ventilador más en la parte de atrás.Para conectar el rgb de los ventiladores lo puedes hacer de 2 maneras, conectarlos directamente a tu motherboard y controlar la iluminación por software o mediante Sata y un control que viene incluído así que no te preocupes si tu motherboard no tiene las tecnologías Aura Sinc o cualquiera de esas tecnologías que sirven para controlar el rgb porque de todas maneras lo puedes conectar sin problema.Tiene además ventana de acrílico para lucir los componentes y el corte diamante con el que está diseñado el gabinete lo hace ver muy pro 😁

Tutto sommato un ottimo mid-tower capace di assecondare più o meno tutte le esigenze.Dopo due giorni passati a provare varie configurazioni hardware, queste sono le mie conclusioni:PRO:- Design accativante e discreto allo stesso tempo- Buona qualità dei materiali, ho avuto case decisamente più costosi ma con materiali di qualità nettamente inferiore- Il pannello laterale in vetro temperato offre un ottima vista dell'interno ed è molto comodo da rimuovere- Arriva fornito di tre ventole RGB- Nonostante sia un mid-tower, è possibile montare un radiatore da 360mm, sia nella parte superiore che dietro al pannello frontale- Non ci sono problemi di spazio per quanto riguarda l'installazione della scheda video- Gli alloggi delle memorie di massa, situati sul retro del case e nella cover del PSU, aiutano a mantenere un interno molto ordinato- Il design semplice e compatto favorisce un ottimo airflow- prezzo molto interessante per quello che offreCONTRO:- Le ventole sono un capellino rumorose- Montando un radiatore da 360mm nella parte superiore, non resta spazio per una ventola sul retro- Non penso sia possibile montare un radiatore più spesso di 30mm nella parte superiore, il mio deep cool castle 360 v2 entra preciso- Ottimo per i dissipatori AIO ma alcuni dissipatori ad aria potrebbero essere troppo alti- lo spazio per alloggiare i cavi nel comparto laterale è appena sufficente e in gerenale le soluzioni per organizzare i cavi potrebbero essere migliori- la cover del PSU è molto bella ma poco pratica e spaziosa, l'installazione dell'alimentatore può risultaredifficoltosa- Non c'è spazio per PSU particolarmente lunghi, il mio corsair RM850x ci sta preciso. E' comunque possibile sacrificare gli alloggi degli hard disk per fare spazio- la cover del PSU ha delle asole dal quale è possibile far passare i connettori audio, USB e dei pulsanti di accensione e reset del pannello frontale. risultano tuttavia poco pratiche a causa del poco spazio disponibile nell'alloggio del PSU- Il pulsante di accensione e l'ingresso per i jack audio/mic non sembrano di ottima qualità, tuttavia, collegando l'headset, non ho riscontrato disturbi sgradevoli nel segnale audio come di solito succede.- I filtri antipolvere sono un po' ridicoli, ma per questo prezzo non lo reputo un problema :)Conclusioni:Il TD500 Mesh di Cooler Master è decisamente un case che punta a soddisfare qualsiasi necessità di una build di livello intermedio, sia a livello pratico che estetico, e riesce a proporsi ad un prezzo interessante riuscendo a puntare sulle caratteristiche importanti, trascurando invece dettagli di secondaria importanza.

Ashley Hinds,5.0,2021 30 May,"
I bought a white one ~6mths ago for my daughter's fancy pants ARGB on the cheap(ish) build and I liked it that much I bought another for myself, in black this time.It was a pleasure to build in with plenty of cable management tie down points, though I had to supply my own velcro ties or zip ties - some more expensive cases come with that but we are talking the cheaper end of the actually worth buying cases here so you can't have everything.Compared to the little Coolermaster N200 I was using before, with every fan slot populated mind you including an old school side GPU intake, my CPU peak temps dropped ~5c and my GPU temps dropped closer to 10c! All from those 3x 120mm stock ARGB fans up the front, plus another 120mm fan I added into in the CPU exhaust position.  If you go a top mounted AIO you wouldn't even need that, with the stock front fans on intake and the top mounted AIO fans on exhaust.Both of my builds are all air cooled, but the case does support a 360mm rad up top where they are most efficient, or in the front if you prefer (not sure if both at once are possible for open loops or if the tanks and/or fans would be in the way of each other with 2x 360mm rads - do your own research and watch motherboard VRM/IO panel cover clearances for top mounted rads)The same chassis is available with the older 12V 4 pin DRGB as well for a cost saving if you don't care about the pretty lights, but if you want the proper unicorn spew the two I bought are the newer 3 pin 5V ARGB variant.The ARGB variant comes with a little ARGB controller and enough splitters to run the stock fans only.  The actual 3 pin fans have a 3 way splittler supplied to require only a single mobo header.Unfortunately the little ARGB controller doesn't have the ability to plug into the motherboard for pass through control for total flexibility like some of the higher model ARGB controllers, but instead you can connect the reset switch to the ARGB controller to switch modes easily without needing to open the case.There is also a newer model apparently that has 4 pin PWN fans instead of the older 3 pin variants this case has, though obviously that model is higher priced again.All in all, a highly recommended chassis with a different colour and supplied fan options to choose from.If you're looking in the $100-150AUD range for an ATX case with good airflow, this should be on your short list.

D. Patton,4.0,2021 28 January,"
Case looks great. The plastic front doesn’t look plastic at all and has a nice matte finish. Case has lots of clearance. I don’t have AIO as I’m air cooled, but looks to be ample clearance on the front panel and likely just enough up top. Fans are reasonably quiet but as with most cases, not a flagship model.I put CM sickle flow fans on the front and moved stock to back. I’m pleased with how quiet despite the venting. Only gripe is clearance in back of case tested my poor cable management skills. You have to be on cable management right away as there isn’t a big margin for error. My other grip is the coolermaster controllers are not great. Just daisy chain and hook up to argb header if you have it. If not, I hope you have better luck than I did. I tried the controller out of curiosity and the software wouldn’t detect.... at all... period.

Glenn Collier,5.0,2020 2 August,"
What’s not to love about this case!  Gamer Nexus gave it great reviews and it doesn’t disappoint.  Lots of room inside to work, lots of radiator mounting options, and that glass side panel, WOW it that thing heavy!  I just LOVE the lip on the bottom that holds it to the case, only need the two top screws to hold it securely.  The mesh front looks stunning and gives great airflow.  I changed out the 3 RGB fans for something NON- RGB as that was the look I was going for.  Amazing case, best investment in my system so far.
"
Eric,1.0,2020 11 August,"
BeWare, this case will not fit any 360 AIO with FANs especially those from NZXT. There is not enough clearance from the motherboard Memory (DDR) memory slots for the fans. I bought it because it stated it works with 360mm radiators; although a radiator on its own will fit if you have a custom water loop it will not fit with any 360mm AIO. And thats trying it at the highest possible position in the installation to the left of the case towards the glass.

 It was my first time building a pc on my own and only relied on what I know. But this case is straight forward. I like everything about it especially the mesh parts and the crystal tempered glass. It looks amazing and I'm proud of it being my first tower case that I buily alone. I am fully satisfied with it.

Came with stripped motherboard stand-off so couldn’t properly secure motherboard. Include RGB header was shorted and when plugged in the LEDs in the fans all shorted out. When asked to return they would only issue a refund once it was back in possession (but I needed a computer case) so kept the piece of junk. Now with shorter headers it’s been at Canada Computers for a month. HORRIBLE experience and HORRIBLE customer service. Wish I never bought it. Very defeating PC build all because of a case and their unwillingness to help

Ganinete elegante com ótimo fluxo de ar. As fans que acompanham o gabinete, possuem boa performance e com baixo ruído. Estou muito satisfeito com a aquisição. O preço hoje é relativamente caro, muito por conta da alta do dólar e escassez de hardware durante a pandemia, com isso, os valores subiram absurdamente. Mas recomendo bastante por conta da qualidade de construção e pelo airflow.

Kalyana,3.0,2020 27 December,"
Beautiful cabinet with good airflow, not excellent but very good airflow.Pros: very beautiful, I got white case because black is 1000 Rs more when I got it which I think is just stupid. But if you can get the black one it would be much better looking and white is bound to get stains and such. Airflow is good. 3 front fans are giving good airflow. CM even gives separate RGB controller incase the motherboard doesn't support RGB or you like a separate controller which is good. I didn't use the controller and plugged it to my Asus motherboard. ASUS, MSI, ASRock follow one type of RGB header and Gigabyte follows another. The case supports both. There are 2 racks given for the standard 3.5 inch SATA HDDs which is at the bottom front, in front of the PSU. This can be removed to give higher ventilation and better space for wires. I removed it and highly recommend doing so, it makes wiring much easier.Cons:1. The product description is misleading. It says 120mm, 240mm, 360mm radiators can be mounted on top and 120mm, 140mm, 240mm, 280mm, 360mm on top.120mm variants, 240mm and 360mm will fit on top but before buying a verify as it may hit any heat shroud your motherboard may have on top especially 360mm one as the length of the radiator may exceed the length of the case or can be hard fit. 360mm means there are 3 x 120mm fans, obviously the plastic around it increases the length a bit, same for width but length varies the most among manufacturers and models. Also discount 1 or 1.5 cm on case length as there are the front panel wires going at the top front and they may be a little obstructive for 360mm rad.So for the top a 240mm Rad is the best bet, all other do proper research on exact dimensions before buying.For the front, its spacier with no obstructions for the radiator except on the bottom if you are going to use 360mm. When front mounting a radiator the pump intake outtake, the pipes should be on the bottom. For 360mm radiator the power shroud on the bottom which extends a good length to the front of the case creates obstruction for the pipes as 360mm radiator will go the bottom most of the case. You can avoid this by mounting with pipes on top but it decreases efficiency and also decreases life of the cooler.All in all, a 240mm rad is recommended for the top, research on exact dimensions with your motherboard heights accounted, with ram sticks, heat shrouds etc if you want to use a 360mm rad.For the front a 280mm is recommended. If you want 360mm research a little if the radiator pipes are flexible enough to bend at almost 80 to 90 degrees. All high end AIO coolers come with braided pipes which make them not so flexible. Plain plastic/rubberish pipes though cheap looking and prone to damage by becoming brittle are more flexible than hard braided ones. Thats something to consider if you are dead set on 360mm rad on the front.2. There is no back side chassis fan, which I think should have been definitely been given this is a budget case. I got a deepcool 120mm fan for it and definitely recommend adding a back side chassis fan. Saw 4 degree temperature drop after adding it.3. May be with my case but the third fan (bottom most) is making little noise. Overall case is not so silent and you can hear it, a bit annoying.4. The fans themselves are DC fans and not PWM fans.5. The space available for cable management is not good. It's somewhat tight, if you don't do it properly there will be a bulge, but cables are guaranteed to be touching the back cover. This has always been my issue with CM cases, a 1 cm extra space would have been great.Personal Opinion:1. The power button is a hard tactile button, I would have preferred a soft tactile button.2. Reset button is very small, and cannot be accidentally be pressed, which is really thoughtful.Overall a beautiful and good case though the case fan noise is a bit of an issue for me. Especially because of the one loud fan it's become a bit annoying. If it persists may replace it. Also it a a bit overpriced in India, you will feel it.

aazxianar,3.0,2021 12 May,"
The stock fans are NOT adressable RGB. They are static and dont get detected by cooler master software. The bottom stock fan is attatched via plastic pins (not screws). this doesnt hold the fan steady and when ramping up, makes LOTS of noise and vibrates the case heavily. There's also no control for the fans (stock) and so the fans will slow down and ramp up very frequently.The bottom fan i had to remove because it was too much of a nuisance. Unforunately i didnt spec the dimensions right and mounted my 360mm corsair radiator at the top of the case. This meant i had to take the middle fan out for RAM clearance. I tried installing said middle AIO fan to the front of the case where the pinned stock fan was. The holes on the case are made specifically for coolermaster fans and so my screws (nor backup screws for the stock fans) would allow me to screw my remaining AIO fan in.All up, this case is impressive for air cooling your components. It is easy to access and easy to clean dust filters. I would recommend a different case if you want more than 2 stock fans or ARGB. The back of the case doesnt have much room for bigger cables and doesnt have many tie down points. Its a struggle to get on if you have a lot of wiring in the back.

I used this tower for my first computer built so my review might be a little bit inexperienced. There are a lot of options to have for cable management. Opening on the side and underneath. Cable management from the power supply was rather hard, but I had the cables secured before putting it inside the case.I had a slight mishap with the case and had to communicate with customer service. They were super understanding and helpful!

I really like this tower. I have 7 fans in it and it keeps temps low. Front fans it comes with are quiet (I turn off the lights).Easy to build and the best cable routing I've built. Easy to make a nice clean build with almost no visible wires.With the lights off it looks cool but not 'too cool'?

I've had this case for a few months now. The aesthetics are nice alongside easy access points.

Muy buen gabinete, del tamaño justo sin caer en excesivo ya que le caben perfectamente 2 radiadores de 240mm y deja espacio incluso para poder hacer un set up frontal push-pull (ventilador - radiador ventilador), se le puede instalar una RTX 3090 sin ningún inconveniente, tiene espacio de sobra.Desafortunadamente la distribución de espacio en la zona superior deja un poco que desear, ya que mis ventiladores del radiador toparon con las memorias, problema que no tuve con mi gabinete anterior, con esta condición no puedo instalarle otras 2 memorias teniendo el ventilador instalado ya que toparian a un grado que pudiera dañar las memorias o los slots de la motherboard. Recomiendo comprar memorias de perfil bajo si se desea poner un radiador en la zona superior.El gabinete es muy amplio, aunque siento que se pudo haber aprovechado mejor el espacio, ya que queda una zona muerta en la zona inferior frontal que si bien es para habilitar un radiador de 360mm frontal, yo no lo haría porque por el espacio y geometría del gabinete te obliga a instalar el radiador con la orientación de las mangueras hacia arriba (si se ponen abajo se forzan demasiado con las paredes del gabinete), cosa que no es muy recomendable en un AIO por el tema de las burbujas de aire.Estéticamente está genial, tiene muy buenos acabados en el mesh frontal y el cristal templado el cual tiene líneas de expresión que simulan continuidad a la geometría de la tapa frontal.Un plus para mi fue que las rejas traseras son desmontables y no la típica rejilla que tienes que romper para darle espacio a las conexiones de la GPU, por lo que si un día retiro la GPU puedo instalar nuevamente las rejillas, evitando que quede el agujero horrible atrás.El montaje del vidrio templado es bueno, sin ser extraordinario. No es de bisagras como los gabinetes de gama alta, es de montaje frontal es decir que los tornillos se aseguran al costado del gabinete en lugar de en la parte trasera al estilo de la tapa del cableado del otro costado. Cuenta con un bracket bastante largo en la zona inferior el cual se engancha al gabinete y asegura al cristal templado, lo cual asegura que no se caiga o deslice hacia abajo evitando que se pueda romper de esa manera, como normalmente ocurre con los cristales de instalación con tornillos en la parte trasera. Los tornillos cuentan con un par de gomas que impiden el. Contacto directo del cristal con el metal del gabinete, lo cual ayuda a reducir esfuerzos residuales en el cristal y lo protege de vibraciones.El gabinete cuenta con 3 ventiladores frontales de 120 mm los cuales son buenos y tienen un rgb bastante llamativo compatible con Aura Sync.En la parte inferior junto al espacio para la PSU tiene una estructura para colocar HDDs y SSDs adicionales la cual es removible, en mi caso eso es un muy buen plus porque por las características de mi setup tengo una cantidad ridícula de cables y ese espacio extra me ayudó a poder acomodar todos el exceso de cables sin ningún problema.En conclusión es un muy buen gabinete por su costo, tiene algunos aspectos a mejorar como su distribución de espacios pero son temas muy específicos de cada set up.

Me gustó mucho este gabinete, decidirme por este fue lo más difícil. Pero resultó ser uno muy resistente y con buen flujo de aire. Incluye todo lo básico con sus tres ventiladores ARGB y sus multicontactos para tener todos conectados a un solo conecto en tu mono. Exelente

El gabinete por si es bueno, por su costo es bastante grande y bueno, sin embargo desde el inicio uno de los ventiladores suena un poco mal, tal vez solo debo ajustarlo pero si es con todos entonces no es un muy buen detalle

I've just assembled my pc and after a week of usage the fans are making noises loud enough to be annoying. There would be some weird sounds coming from them; So I turn computer off, fidget with the fans to see if wires are caught and turn on computer again, the noise would disappear. On a different day, the annoying sound comes back again. If I didn't have issues with the fan, it would be a decent case for the price.

SI bien no le puedo poner 5 estrellas ya que viene con un rayón en el panel de cristal templado, y no me anime a devolverlo ya que era un super precio que jamás se volvería a ver y eran las ultimas piezas, de ahí en fuera el gabinete es precioso e imponente, que brinda una excelente gestión de cables

Caja de PC súper TOP que me ha encantado en casi todos los sentidos.El cristal templado es de una gran calidad y tiene dos líneas a modo de decoración, además que solo necesita de dos tornillos grandes para acoplarse al chasis. Es realmente espaciosa y me cabe una 3070ti de 3 ventiladores sin problemas, además de un gran disipador. El flujo de aire de serie es correcto aunque lo puedes ajustar. Es una pena que solo incluya 3 ventiladores, podrían haber puesto uno extra en la parte de atrás para sacar el aire.En la parte de arriba trae un gran filtro anti polvo magnético que funciona realmente bien. Además del mallado de la parte delantera en los 3 ventiladores.Como única pega que le pongo en el control de los LED de los ventiladores. Incluye un mando que no es a distancia sino que se queda dentro de la caja por tanto si en algún momento quiero apagarlos no puedo hacerlo y tendría que abrir el pc para hacerlo, o simplemente para cambiar el modo de iluminación es algo que no me gusta nada y no entiendo porque no me reconoce el programa, será para que compre el controlador propio de cooler master el cual no se incluye en la caja.Pese a esto me encanta por estética, calidad y gestión de cableado, muy contento con ella y la recomiendo sin ninguna duda. Espero que te resulte útil.

Cercavo un case con una buona aerazione e bello esteticamente e il td500 mesh mi è sembrato un ottimo compromesso tra le due qualità.Provengo da un Cooler Master Haf-x 942, un full-tower assemblato nel 2014 che pecca in estetica a vantaggio dell'insieme di periferiche che si possono installare e del flusso d'aria.Farò un paragone tra i due e di come mi sono trovato personalmente durante l'assemblaggio del TD500 mesh.- Estetica: tra i due non c'è paragone, il TD500 è superiore rispetto all'Haf-x, l'illuminazione RGB dei componenti è premiata dalla presenza del pannello laterale in vetro temperato. Inizialmente ero scettico anche sulla resa degli RGB delle 3 ventole frontali, ma una volta accesa la macchina mi sono dovuto ricredere.- Assemblaggio: per entrambi l'assemblaggio dei soli componenti è risultato semplice, è importante che si verifichi quali siano i vincoli sulle dimensioni dei componenti, dato che parliamo di un case con spazio ridotto rispetto ad un full-tower.- Cable management: complesso, ma buono. Questa è una caratteristica che immagino sia generalmente condivisa tra tutti i mid-tower, quindi non prendetela mirata unicamente al TD500 mesh. Avendo meno spazio di un full-tower in cui disporsse i vari cavi di alimentazione e collegamenti sulla scheda madre la loro disposizione va decisa con più attenzione per poi essere in grado di chiudere il pannello laterale.Comunque, il TD500 dispone di diversi punti dove poter applicare delle fascette per far are i cavi e renderli ordinati. È complesso, ma non impossibile.- Disposizione: molto buona. Essendo un case più compatto è leggero del Haf-x che senza componenti interni pesa ben 15Kg, è possibile posizionarlo anche sopra la scrivania senza problemi.- Rumore: silenzioso. Ritenevo che il mio l'Haf-x fosse un case silenzioso, ma il td500 mesh lo è ancora di più.In generale lo ritengo un buonissimo case per chi ne cerchi uno con buona aerazione, estetica e bassa rumorosità con le ventole preinstallate.

è comodo con l'apertura laterale in vetro temprato con 2 sole viti, essendo mesh aspira un po' da tutte le parti e ovviamente accumula anche un po' più polvere dalle bocchette (anche se ci sono i filtri magnetici) alcuni sono un po' fastidiosi perchè appena li tocchi si sganciano
"
Angelo G.,3.0,2021 15 March,"
Reso ma andiamo con ordine; il case è bello ma a questo prezzo, 98 euro al momento dell’acquisto, si prende altro in relazione alla costruzione e tante altre piccole o grandi cose, dipende dal punto di vista.La maglia in mesh è bella, particolare, si può perfino smontare interamente e pulire se serve ma sopra di questa i pulsanti accensione e reset/comando led, sono molli.. sarà una sciocchezza ma danno l’impressione di non durare a lungo, forse è meno evidente sul reset/comando led ma l’altro….In top lo spazio non manca ma dietro per i cavi mi sarei aspettato di più, può essere che sia io incapace o prevenuto da esperienze con altri case ma anche mezzo centimetro in più avrebbe fatto comodo. Secondo me gli spazi andrebbero calcolati a carico massimo, mi spiego meglio, se ci possono entrare 2 hdd da 3.5 e 2 hdd/ssd da 2.5 ecc ecc lo devi prevedere.Ok ci sono gli nvme e ok, non è un case per dedito a server però.. per chi sa che di spazio per questi ce n’è non vedo perché non montarli se si hanno!Ci sono 3 ventole, argb con sdoppiatore ma niente fanhub se non un controller per gestire i led. In espulsione la ventola non è presente!Il vetro è buono, spesso, le linee geometriche non sono brutte visivamente, non mi dispiacciono ma devono piacere, a volte un vetro semplice può stancare. Il meccanismo di aggancio dello stesso, però, non mi convince molto; è comodo perché si sgancia velocemente ma non ci sono ne magneti o gomme sul perimetro, solo due guarnizioni che vanno fra il telaio e il vetro per poi agganciarsi con due vitine.Degni di nota sono i le gomme nelle asole passacavi (peccato non ci siano anche sotto per gli spazi fra scheda madre e alimentatore), i carrelli per gli hardisk da 3.5 che allargano per un montaggio veloce, gomme e viti per gli hd da 2.5 da posizionare davanti o dietro la scheda madre con attacco/stacco veloce.La marca non giustifica il costo in questo caso, ci sono piccole lacune o disattenzioni che non mi sarei aspettato. Oppure si poteva aumentare anche il prezzo di qualche euro ma far caso a due o tre dettagli che avrebbero fatto di questo case il re indiscusso della fascia. In ultimo, forse è la mia impressione, la lamiera è leggerissimamente meno spessa della media.. o forse è qualcosa di imputabile alla costruzione, magari mi sbaglio. In conclusione per un modello rivolto all’airflow non metti la ventola in espulsione, eh Coolermaster? Qualche griglia di areazione lateralmente ci stava per prendere più aria da fuori o la possibilità di posizionare una o due ventole stile Antec-Flux!Compratelo, per carità, ma per 100 euro non ci sta. Solo e se cala un bel po’ di prezzo, a quel punto è un affare

 Per me davvero un case eccellente, bello, robusto, con un vetro temperato di ottima qualità , addirittura con delle incisioni, che contribuiscono a renderlo più aggressivo, nel caso della mia versione sono parenti già di fabbrica 3 ventole argb, con relativo controller( ma pilotabili anche separatamente), bello e pratico  il sistema di cable management, e soprattutto tanto spazio al suo interno! L'alimentatore è separato da una copertura, che lo nasconde, ma ne fa trapelare il logo, possibilità di installare nascosti due hhd da 3,5 sempre ben nascosti appunto dalla copertura inferiore, e quattro slot SSD: 2 sono a vista, e due nel retro, proprio dietro la scheda madre. Presente oltretutto un filtro superiore magnetico davvero pratico, e uno inferiore ad incastro a proteggere l'alimentatore, ah dimenticavo, può ospitare qualsiasi sistema di raffreddamento,120mm, 240mm, 280mm, 360mm... Scegliete voi.... Note negative?Mah più che altro un consiglio, e cioè quello di effettuere da subito un buon cable management, dato che poi il pannello laterale della mobo andrà a nascondere il tutto, rendendo come nel mio caso, un po' difficoltosa la chiusura, che dire... Buon acquisto e buon assemblaggio, ciao!!!Grazie Amazon che come al solito me l'ha consegnato nel giro di 24 ore ...

Lo scrivo subito: Un noctua NH-D15 (quello con due ventole) ci entra per meno di un millimetro, più precisamente:La mia build è composta da mobo X570 Aorus Elite, montando il dh-15 , la ventola in posizione push causa un problema: lo spazio rimanente fino al vetro è minore di un millimetro, o forse tocca proprio con il vetro, quindi:NON ADATTO PER UNA X570 + Noctua nh-d15; Probabilmente con una mobo di generazione precedente si riesce a montarlo, ma nulla di certo.Piccola info: Un noctua nh-d15 con una sola ventola (esiste in questa configurazione per l'acquisto, si chiama nh-d15-S) riesce a tenere a bada un ryzen 3950x sotto full carico, quindi magari chiedetevi se vi serve un nh-d15 se montate processori più calmi :DPassando al case, è ottimo in tutto, ottima qualità costruttiva, super facile fare il cable management con le fascette e veltri inclusi, buono lo spazio per il PSU e cavi di alimentazione anche con la cage per hdd montata.Il controller rgb pwm che vi danno in dotazione non vi permette di avere le ventole con un illuminazione fissa, potete scegliere vari colori ma saranno sempre con un motivo ad intermittenza (abbastanza lento almeno) . L'unica colorazione che rimane sempre accesa è arcobaleno.Un bel 4.5 su 5 per quanto mi riguarda.

IL vetro temperato leggermente oscurato gli da un bel effetto grintoso ed elegante . Possibilita di posizionare HD ssd ovunque. Veramente un OTTIMO CASE.Luca

got the case, it is as you expect - a great looking case with 3 okay fans.Mine initially came with a couple of broken clips on the front panel (I assume it was a returned product) - contacted the seller and they immediately worked on sending out a replacement front panel - they're amazing, keep you up to date on every step of the process and will ensure you're satisfied with your purchase.Other than that minor issue, the case itself was perfect, not a single scratch or imperfection on the glass or body.almost a year later and the case is still perfect (not really one of those products that goes downhill with time but you get the point), still loving it. Would recommend =)

It’s very easy to work with but only get if you like the look obviously this goes with every case but only thing I can say is the front panel is tough to detach but won’t break easily just don’t be too rough but not too gentle

Gunjan,5.0,2020 29 June,"
This is a detailed review of the Cooler Master TD500 Mesh PC Case>>Packaging: The case arrived well packaged it its original box. However, the box had been opened previously, because it contained additional packaging material (scrap paper) inside the actual product box. The case arrived in a dusty condition, and judging by the few scuff marks on the product, I can reasonably believe that it was previously unboxed. The product works fine, so I did not return it.>>Build Quality/Design: This case is one of the best designed cases available in the market. The front mesh has a 3D pattern, reminiscent to that of the Fractal Design Meshify C, and I really like it, mainly because it does not restrict airflow. The tempered glass also has an etched design, which is very unique. The fan support is awesome, and you can also do some custom water cooling in it. The front cover is easy to remove, and the front IO is actually attached to the frame rather than the front panel, which makes regular maintainance really easy. Both the front USB ports are USB 3.0, which is nice.  However, one of the downsides is the PSU shroud. It does not cover the entire length of the case, as a result of which there is very little clearence between the PSU and the hard-drive bay. The HDD Bays are removable, but you will have to remove them probably if you use a longer/ modular PSU. Also, the cutout on the shroud is very big, and so you can actually see the rat's nest of cables behind my smaller VS650 PSU.>>Included Hardware: Aside from the case, you also get 3 ARGB Fans in the front. However, the fans are 3-Pin ones, which means that they are not PWM and you won't be able to control their speed, unless you have a Motherboard that supports Voltage Control for fans. The fans come with all the required splitters for power and ARGB, and are compatible with the common ARGB standards. It also comes with a ARGB controller, however it has very limited customisation. Also, at this price, a 4th fan at the rear exhaust was expected.>>Conclusion: Overall, this is a very good looking case from Cooler Master with great airflow and hardware compatibility at a reasonable price. Definitely recommended.

Amazon Kunde,3.0,2021 17 May,"
Heute endlich aus Italien nach fast 7 Tagen angekommen.. Amazon könnte ruhig deutlich zeigen aus welchem Lager sie ihre Produkte verschicken 😑 ! Aber gut nun zum Produkt ich habe es sofort zusammengebaut und muss sagen das Gehäuse ist in echt einfach doppelt so schön als auf den Bildern. Ich hab in einem case noch nie so einen guten airflow gesehen bzw gespürt wenn ich auf dem Bett liege (steht ca 1 Meter vom PC entfernt ) spüre ich selbst da immer wieder einen kühlen Hauch der vom PC kommt! Ich hatte nach dem ersten Start die Tastatur oben drauf abgelegt und da spürte man den airflow sehr auf dem Bett da kann man sich ja fast den Ventilator im sommer sparen .😆 die Lüfter sind angenehm leise und meine Skepsis bezüglich der Lautstärke war schnell verflogen , eine ps4 ist gefühlt 10 mal so laut die übertönt den PC komplett bei mir .. Die rgbs zaubern auf meinen (noch) alten Board schöne Effekte demnächst mit nem neuem Board und 3 pin argb Anschluss sicherlich noch besser! Hinten ist sehr viel Spielraum für kabelmanagement, trotzdem war ich sehr froh ein vollmodulares netzteil zu haben.. Es wurde dann doch schon recht eng hinter dem Netzteil um alles dort zu verstecken. Das Gehäuse ist fast rundum perfekt. Nun zu dem Punkt warum es nicht 5 Sterne geworden sind! Als ich mit dem zusammenbauen fertig war und mich in dieses Gehäuse von Sekunde zu Sekunde mehr verliebte , merkte ich beim zurecht rücken das mein Gehäuse extrem kippelt 🤦🏻‍♂️ es ist das erste mal das ich sehe das ein Gehäuse kippelt und dann auch noch so extrem, dass es erst besser wird wenn ich unter einem der Beine ein usb Kabel lege was gute 5 mm dick ist 😑 ich werde es trotzdem behalten, da ich es erst nach dem Zusammenbau gemerkt habe und höchstwahrscheinlich ein Stück selbstklebenden Filz oder so drunter klebe ..aber trotzdem bei so einem schicken in meinen augen fast perfekten Gehäuse wieso muss es an den Füßen scheitern ?! Ein weiterer minus Punkt in meinen Augen war die kompatibilität mit einem micro atx Board die unteren 2 schrauben hängen bei mir in der Luft ..Nichts desto trotz bin ich sehr zufrieden ich werd da ja nicht die ganze zeit dran rumwackeln und ich plane eh demnächst ein atx Board zu verbauen von daher alles in meinem fall halb so wild.. der preis ist auch völlig in ordnung wenn man bedenkt was man erhält. ich hab es reduziert für 85 euro gekauft und wenn man bedenkt das man hier ein dickes Glas Seitenteil hat 3 rgb lüfter über die man auf keinen Fall meckern kann und perfekten airflow mit staubfiltern überall wo man sie braucht. Wegen den Füßen hätte es ruhig ein tick günstiger sein können, vielleicht aber auch einfach 5 Euro teurer mit gescheiten Füßen 😉aber vielleicht war esauch einfach nur bei meinem case so und ich hatte pech.

Pazagor,4.0,2021 29 June,"
Case molto bello esteticamente a mio parere, la forma del pannello frontale fa una bella figura ed anche il vetro sul lato, però ha un problema non da sottovalutare: le dimensioni.Mi sono trovato in grossa difficoltà sia con gli spazi che con il cablaggio all'interno del case, ho montato un iCUE h100i RGB della Corsair ma non nella postazione prevista in quanto nel top case toccava le ram, ho quindi dovuto scambiarlo con le ventole frontali, facendo arrivare però un po' di aria in meno alla PSU (non un grosso problema).Ho anche avuto diversi problemi con il cablaggio in quanto le canaline a disposizione per far scorrere i fili ci sono solo sul pannello frontale,  e lo spazio nel pannello dietro la scheda madre è veramente poco. Do 4 stelle perché mi piace molto esteticamente ed ha un ottimo Airflow con la configurazione di ventole giusta, peccato per gli scarsi spazi nonostante sia un ATX.
"
Joseph ,4.0,2020 22 July,"
The case its self is Brilliant. Has a nice sleek design and the front mesh panel looks great with the back-lit RGB fans and does a good job of stopping dust getting in. Cable management is easy and there are many different routing holes and clips for your included zipties. The top of the case is open and has a magnetic removable dust filter making for easy cleaning. The front panel is also easily removable.The bottom of the case has yet another removable filter though this time the quality is not as on par as the others.The inside is spacious enough for any current GPU but is of course limited to ATX boards only, no larger.If you plan to use a large CPU cooler then ensure that this case has enough clearance. Right now im running a Noctua NH-D15 inside and it only just manages to squeeze in. Also take note that if you are using loud fans or coolers the sound will be more audible with the mesh than a conventional case.The problem i have had with this case is the three included air intake fans that came in the front, They work for cooling fine but have this irritating noise that almost sounds like a fishing line being reeled in. I ended up replacing them for some more expensive ones anyway so for those sensitive to noise maybe skip on the extra fans and get some high quality ones yourself separate.

Molti mi odieranno per sto fatto, ma per me é piccolo, dentro é montata una scheda madre grande e un radiatore da 320 mm (messo in fronte) impossibile metterlo sopra se avete schede madri grandi.Ma oltre questo.. Laria circola mooolto bene, il pc si presenta molto bello nella scrivania e fa una figura piu che elegante che tamarra, peccato che le ventole non sono programmabili, ma sono ottimissime anche quelle... Da prendere in considerazione il fatto che 3 vontole di questo livello costano 30€ e il case ti sta costando 95€ É REGALATO

La sua figura la fa . Molto bello esteticamente , molto spazioso . Ci si può mettere di tutto . Un po’ rumorose le ventole davanti , sotto stress  si fanno sentire , e per chi vuole silenzio , non è l’essenziale . Beh , non è un problema enorme , alla fine si possono cambiare . Lo spazio dietro per il passaggio dei cavi , non è tantissimo , però è ben strutturato , infatti i molteplici buchi per far passare i fili , permettono un ottimo cable management. In termini di airflow, io lo uso con un dissipatore a liquido della Corsair da 360mm , una ventola da 120 mm posta sul retro , più le 3 ventole poste sul davanti che il case da in dotazione , la cpu sotto stress non supera i 60 e idem la gpu . Molto arieggiato anche con il vetro chiuso . Consigliato

Angel@,5.0,2020 19 June,"
Sono felice dell’acquisto. Il vetro temperato, che è abbastanza trasparente e permette di vedere benissimo i componenti all’interno, ha delle linee che lo attraversano e formano delle figure geometriche tipo rombo.Le ventole frontali sono già cablate, per cui sono presenti sia i cavi di alimentazione che i cavi di controllo per le ARGB.Il case viene fornito con un piccolo controller per poter gestire le luci ARGB delle ventole. Il controller è quello mini della cooler master. Io ho installato nella parte superiore anche il sistema di raffreddamento a liquido della CPU della cooler master. Nel sistema di raffreddamento a liquido era compreso anche il controller standard, al quale ho collegato le ventole del case. Il tutto funziona alla perfezione.Le ventole frontali funzionano perfettamente e spingono molta aria all’interno del case.Avendo montata il radiatore sulla parte superiore (radiatore da 240mm) non ho installato la ventola nella parte posteriore del case (mettendo la mano nella parte posteriore si sente benissimo il flusso d’aria uscente spinto dalle tre ventole frontali).Nel case c’è un filtro antipolvere superiore magnetizzato, che aiuta a mantenerlo pulito, attraverso lo smontaggio.La gestione dei cavi nella parte posteriore è abbastanza agevole, ci sono molti punti dove poter bloccare i cavi con delle fascette (importante avere i cavi abbastanza lunghi).Gli slot dove alloggiare gli hard disk (ce ne sono due per hard disk da 3,5 pollici) sono estraibili, per cui estremante comodo risulta il montaggio.In sintesi sono felice dell’acquisto.Spero che la mia recensione possa esserti utile.

Ho comprato questo case un anno fa, quando il prezzo oscillava sempre sopra i 100 euro e la disponibilità era limitata, tant'è che per averlo venduto e spedito amazon a 95 Euro avevo aspettato più di un mese dal momento dell'ordine.Una attesa che fu ben giustificata vista la bontà del prodotto.Personalmente non ho ancora visto un mid tower con gli spazi interni che ha questo. Fantastico. Ci sta dentro di tutto, e senza aver componenti e cavi compressi.Lo spazio dietro la mobo permette un cable management ottimale, anche per chi utilizza diversi HD/ssd o chi ha alimentatori non modulari.Ventole silenziosissime, areazione al top, filtri che lavorano bene e fanno entrare poca polvere.Effetto visivo per me è da 10 e lode.

The case looks amazing. I can't judge the airflow but it has a mash front panel so how bad can it be. The only downside is no exhaust so you might want to carry over 1 fan from an old case.
"
Nathaniel,3.0,2022 1 March,"
I used my original NZXT Phantom case for more than 10 years. It was very well built and got a lot of accessories with it. But it doesn't support 360mm radiator and the power button wasn't really working well. So i bit the bullet and bought this. First impressions, hardly any spare screws or tools. Quality is ok but not good or something to write about. Cable management behind could be better. The fans are ok and relatively silent. The case airflow is good and you need to buy a exhaust fan for the rear of the case. The radiator fits just right, and doesn't have room for anything else. Be mindful of the Ram clearance though if you install a 360mm radiator.

È arrivato in largo anticipo. A una linea veramente accattivante con le ventole accese sarà sicuramente uno spettacolo.

A questo prezzo mi aspettavo qualcosa in più. Per ora do quatro stelle più in la vedremo. Il case fa la sua figura ,bello ,funzionale e spazioso unico neo il comando di illuminazione dei LED è all'interno e se vuoi cambiare colore all RGB vi tocca aprirlo .

I did a lot of research and looked for many cases in this price range but settled for TD mesh 500 due to its cooling capabilities.Pros: lightweight, decent build quality, good paint quality, front 3 x 120 mm fans, ample of space inside to fit even largest graphics card. good argb effects can be controlled through argb software depending on the motherboard. Temperes glass is of really good quality and held by thumb screws. good cable management but not that great. 4x SSD mounting ports, rubber gromets inculded with case. 2 X HDD drive cages.Cons:  No exhaust fan included which should have been included in this price range. right side panel behind the motherboard flexes easily and not of good quality. The gap between the panel is less. for best cooling you need to put 3 more fans inside which makes the case too pricey as per me. front audio port doesn't have HD audio and it sucks. The front USB ports feel cheaply integrated as they get pushed inside when you put pendrive. restart button is so tiny, I don't understand why they couldn't provide a normal size button?HDD trays are of plastic and one tray was bent when I got it. feels cheap.Finally I want to say that it's a decent cabinet and has good features. Front 3 x fans pull good amount of air inside the cabinet but you definitely need an exhaust fan. Just for the mesh front and front fans they have cheaped out on other aspects of the case which Cooler Master could've easily provided as some other cases provide rear fans and better build quality.

Che dire è veramente un ottimo prodotto, mi fa letteralmente impazzire. Super compatto e spazioso, entra tranquillamente una eatx con due dissipatore da 360 (top e front) e una 3080 ti. Il design è oggettivamente bello soprattutto con l'incisione del vetro che richiama la parte frontale. Super consigliato !

First of all, I ordered a black cabinet and received a White one. I was okay with it because I liked the look of the white case and that was what I initially thought of buying. But anyway this case looks very premium and the crystal style desing on the side tempered glass is excellent and it gives it that unique limited edition look. The case has excellent build quality and I love it.Only complaint would be the power supply mesh filter on the bottom. It could have been a slide in mechanism. If they made it like that and increased the price a tiny bit, I would still be okay with it.That's my only complaint about this case. Everything else is great.The fans that came with it are extremely silent and good looking. They might not be the best out there. But they do the job decent enough and it looks good.

Das Gehäuse hat einen super Airflow, selbst unter Vollauslastung sind alle Komponenten-Temperaturen im grünen Bereich.Das Kabelmanagement ist nicht wirklich durchdacht, der Platz zwischen den rechten Wänden ist viel zu schmal, man muss schon ordentlich fummeln und teils Kabel biegen um sie in dem Hohlraum sinnvoll zu verlegen.Die rechte Aussenwand bekommt man nur mit Kraftaufwand geschlossen. Nicht gut für die Kabel...1 o. 2 cm breiter und das Gehäuse hätte 6 Sterne von mir bekommen.So leider nur 3 Sterne

Uno dei migliori case che abbia mai avuto, è possibile inserire di tutto e di qualsiasi dimensione, sicuramente non lo acquisterei se avete poco spazio in casa poiché è tra i case più grandi in circolazione
"
Federico Ceretti,4.0,2020 18 July,"
Case con ottimo airflow grazie al mesh anteriore e alle 3 ventole da 120mm incluse con il case,molto apprezzata la possibilità di poter aggiungere 4 ulteriori ventole da 120mm oppure una da 120mm sul retro e 2 da 140mm superiori.Il cable management risulta molto semplice e lo spazio interno è assurdo, troveranno posto facilmente schede grafiche anche oltre i 30cm (la mia rtx 2060 super a due ventole ci sta larga) .Un case molto spazioso, bello da vedere, compreso il controller dei led e sotto i 100€ forse l'unica pecca sono le ventole che avrei apprezzato con qualche rpm in più sacrificando la rumorosità (le ventole arrivano ad un massimo di 1350rpm).

Ein tolles Gehäuse sowohl optisch als auch funktionell. Die staubfänger sind gut abnehmbar und abwischbar. Im Innenraum ist genügend Platz vorhanden. Einziges Manko ist das Staub oft in die ritzen des frontpanels rutscht. Die Lüfter sind gut und für die meisten builds ausreichend. Jedoch nicht sehr leise.
"
Alfredo Baiano,5.0,2021 6 December,"
Esteticamente bellissimo! 3 ventole ARGB che si collegano tutte con un solo cavo per ""illuminarle"" ed un solo cavo PWM per ""alimentarle"". Purtroppo come qualcuno aveva già notato, le ventole fanno uno strano rumore di fondo che sembra provenire da lontano ed è molto fastidioso, un vero peccato. 😓
"
Marco,5.0,2021 10 April,"
Il design è gradevole, gli interni sono pensati bene per nascondere il più possibile il cablaggio in modo ordinato, l'installazione è piuttosto semplice non appena si capisce come prenderlo.L'unica cosa di cui purtroppo mi sono accorto troppo tardi è che non è provvisto di vani per lettori/masterizzatori dvd, perchè purtroppo ho pensato che si aprisse il fronte e li avesse a scomparsa... Sarà anche un po' errore mio ma... nel 2021 i dvd esistono ancora... non sono dei floppy disc o videocassette... Comunque nel complesso un bel case.
"
Dan Lloyd,4.0,2020 11 July,"
Great case for anyone that needs that extra  airflow!Would have been nicer if it came with 4 fans so one could be configured as an exhaust fan but this is only a minor grumble!Looks great with the mesh front and RGB fans.Wasn't quite enough space in the top of the case to mount the NZXT Kraken Z63 so I had to mount it up front.Unless you have a modular PSU, the space behind the motherboard can be a little tight but is still manageable.All this being said, I still really like the case!

È stato il primo pc che ho assemblato. Ho scelto questo case per la forma, lo spazio e la possibilità di poter giocare con ventole e componenti.È andato tutto bene. Solo che il radiatore.Un ml360 rgb illuson, sulla parte superiore non è entrato e ho dovuto inserirlo sul front. Nulla di grave. Ma leggendo recensioni e specifiche mi aspettavo entrasse.Per il resto ottimo case

Tiene mucha ventilación, viene con tres ventiladores ARGB. Yo le he instalado 4 ventiladores ARGB (3 en la parte superior y 1 en la parte trasera). El cristal templado tiene un diseño espectacular y puedes ver todos tus componentes de manera limpia.Como punto negativo, la gestión de cables en la parte trasera pudiera haber sido mejor. Otro punto es que los ventiladores aún en lo mínimo, tienen un pequeño sonido como si fuera ruido eléctrico, cosa que no me pasa con los ventiladores que compré.El filtro antipolvo superior es imantado, lo cual ayuda a su mantenimiento.En general estoy contento con la compra. Es mi segunda caja de Cooler Master y seguro repetiré.
"
alberto,4.0,2021 2 February,"
Case stupendo e funzionale, però avrei preferito materiali migliori visto che si riga facilmente e ciò mi preoccupa nella sua durata (visto il costo non esiguo, mi aspettavo di meglio)Per il resto spazioso, 3 ventole ARGB incluse, meshato e con filtri sopra e sottoAh dimenticavo, la gestione dei cavi è così così, un poco più di spazio avrebbe fatto bene
"
Alex militello,5.0,2021 12 November,"

"
Fabio Aiello,5.0,2020 23 July,"
Un ottimo case sia per estetica che per maneggevolezza nell'assemblaggio, un peccato solo per il controller rgb che ho dovuto riadattarlo posizionandolo nella griglia posteriore del case con delle fascette perchè la sincronizzazione è usufruibile solo con schede madri Gigabyte, e la mia non essendolo ho dovuto usare il controller fisico che adatta il sistema. Le 3 ventole rgb anteriori sono ottime e tirano dentro molta aria, ho dovuto aggiungere una ventola posteriore da 120mm per un airflow migliore ma si trovano anche a pochissimi euro. Una cosa molto comoda sono i filtri metallici magnetici in modo da non perderli mai.In riassunto: Ottimo acquisto, consigliatissimo
"
PortaleTech,5.0,2021 13 October,"
Già dall'imballaggio si percepisce una solidità molto alta.Il case si presenta benissimo con 3 ventole aRGB posteriori a mio avviso stupende.Ce la si può giostrare tranquillamente per il cable management sia lato interno che lato esterno del case.Cooler Master una garanzia come sempre.
"
Eddie L.,4.0,2021 13 January,"
Case estremamente estetico, spazio adeguato al cable management, bello sotto ogni aspetto, soprattutto la griglia frontale e la vetrata fumé.Ho montato molto agevolmente un dissipatore a liquido da 360mm.Non do 5 stelle perché le ventole sono rumorose. Per 95€ mi aspettavo di meglio, aggiornerò la recensione dopo aver smanettato i settaggi delle velocità.

Das Gewinde in den vormontierten Mainboard-Distannz-Schrauben war unterschiedlich groß.Mein Mainboard lies sich nur mit zwei Schrauben anschrauben, die anderen Schrauben versanken in den Bohrungen ohne Widerstand und Halt. Mit den mitgelieferten Schrauben und den Schrauben mit denen mein Mainboard im Alten Gehäuse abefestigt war.Habe diese dann mit dem mitgelieferten Werkzeug rauseschraubt und die aus meinem alten Gehäuse dort eingeschraubt.Ansonsten bin ich sehr zufrieden mit Verarbeitung, Optik und Montagemöglichkeiten. Kühlung ist gut, auch mit sehr niedrig drehenden Lüftern. Es rappelt nichts, es klappert nichts.

Antonio,5.0,2021 24 September,"

Das Case an sich ist optisch und technisch ganz gut die Lüfter laufen sehr leise. Was mich aufgeregt hat ist der Platz hinten für das kabel Management die 2cm sind eine Katastrophe und etwas nach oben könnte es auch noch gehen weil man sonst Probleme mit hohen rams und der wakü bekommt. Was noch dazu kommt ich hatte Probleme meine 3080 zu verbauen die ist einfach nicht rein gegangen warum auch immer erst mit viel Kraftaufwand und langem rum probieren hats geklappt. Ob ich es mir nochmal kaufen würde. Eher nicht.

Good cooling. Good case. Good price.There was one issue that i had. If you have a large CPU cooler (Like the Noctua NH-D15 Dual-Tower CPU cooler 140mm) you won't have enough space to install an extra fan on the back of case. Other than that no issues.

Jordan,5.0,2021 25 January,"
The fans are sexy, manually controllable (via a remote) and it makes for a brilliant setup, but assembling it together with a high end rig can be a bit challenging because of it's PSU-back of mobo cable management setup. Feeding the cables through is a pain in the ass and can take hours.

Rispetto ai vecchi case, è bello, certo ce ne saranno anche di migliori, ma non è male, le tre ventole davanti pare che facciano respirare, unica cosa c'è un interuttore per scegliere la modalità delle luci delle ventole, sarebbe stato meglio metterlo esterno.

"
Dominik Steinmetz,5.0,2020 20 July,"
Ich bin mehr als zufrieden mit dem Gehäuse, aber war auch nicht anders zu erwarten. Jedoch ist es wie bei allem nicht perfekt, erst ein weiterer Lüfter hinten macht den Airflow perfekt und sollte auf jeden Fall nachgerüstet werden, schade dass dieser nicht von Haus aus dabei ist. Weiterhin finde ich es überaus schade, dass keine ordentliche luftersteuerung beiliegt. Trotzdem insgesamt ein Top Gehäuse zu einem sehr guten Preis.

Nella recensione non parlerò del fatto che il prodotto è arrivato con leggere ammaccature e sbeccato al bordo,ma parlerò invece della difficoltà per installare gli SSD tramite il sistema a gommini,dal momento che è stato necessario martellare a pugni per far in modo che l'SSD aderisse alla struttura,del fatto che non è realmente compatibile con aurosync dal momento che è da 3 pin l'attacco e non da 4 e può essere scomodamente acceso attaccando il filo al controller e spento staccandolo,che fissare la scheda video risulta davvero scomodo per la posizione dell'attacco e il pannello di vetronon si chiude perfettamente dritto ma resta storto e infine che la scheda madre non viene avvitata perfettamente a causa di problemi geometrici,diffidate dalle magnifiche recensioni che si trovano..... dalle magnifiche pubblicità,l'unica fortuna è stata che Amazon mi ha fatto il rimborso parziale grazie alle ammaccature riscontrate

Gefallen das Design und verarbeitung ist recht gut. Jetzt kommts, aaaaber die abstandhalter für motherboard scheinen andere maße zu haben, man kann keine schrauben reindrehen, sie rutschen durch, greifen nich egal was man für grösen nimmt, man könnte denken zu große gewinde geschnitten. Somit kann man nicht weutermachen und muss sich neue kaufen. Die farbbeschichtung is so dünn, das man husten kann und man hat kratzer drauf. Also sehr vorsichtig, extrem vorsichtig. Die kabelöffnungen die nich gummiert sind, sind so schmal das das breite gehäusekabel kaum ranging, war sehr knifflig. Auf dem bild sah ich einen rgb hub, war leider nich dabei. Sonst passt es schon.

Nel complesso il case si presenta bene, i materiali sono buoni e il pannello laterale in vetro fa una buona figura. L'airflow del case è ottimo.

the case itself is amazing the design is super slick and cable management is easy, but the included fans make an annoying sound its fine with headphones but still a little annoying but the rest is great.

If you get a 280mm liquid cooler and plan to fit in front or top, it does not fit as it describes.If you install on top, it covers a portion of the RAM area therefore cant install RAMIf install on front, there is a hump in the casing which won't allow enough space to properly fit it in front.Otherwise anything 240mm and smaller fits perfect

Just a great case overall. You need silent air cooling? It's got you covered. The only issue I had was that the included RGB controller was a little bit confusing to get hooked up correctly. But when I say, a little, I mean little. The instructions left a lot to be desired.All in all, great PC mid tower case!

After I spent a while in the BIOS messing with fan curves, this thing is basically silent and the airflow is awesome. Keeps my 3080 and 5950x cool without noise until I'd really putting them to use.The two things that I wish were different are:-5-10mm more space in the back for cable management. It's a tight squeeze getting that right side panel on.-A USB-C port on the front panel.

Value, thats what i would use to refer to this case, it is very well constructed has a very nice look to it, cable management is great.Pros: Fit and finish, good cable management, fits my Corsair H105 cooler, fans are nice and bright and quiet.Cons: Even with cables on opposite side tied down, closing the case is a little snug.I would recommend this case to a friend.

Pros:Excelente ventilaciónVentiladores con buen RGBExcelente estética.Incluye controlador RGB con efectos predeterminados ya demás compatible con el botón ""reset"" del gabinete.Contras:No cuenta con filtro de aire frontal (solo la rejilla)El filtro inferior de la fuente de poder es de pobre calidad y se cae al mínimo movimiento.Los ventiladores tienen un ligero ruido al que o te acostumbras o te vuelve loco en el intento.Si como a mí solo te interesa la estética y ventilación de este gabinete, no te arrepentirás. Los contras son difícilmente una razón para no halagar este producto, y si ya cuentas con ventiladores propios de una mejor calidad entonces saldrás ganando con este gabinete.

 Hermoso gabinete, pensaba que era especial para meterle enfriador líquido y radiador, pero no hace falta si no cuentas con elloPor mi parte solo contaba con 3 ventiladores pero el gabinete incluía los 3 frontales y quedó ufff papá 💜 💪 de perlas,En cuanto a tamaño está grandecito pero a futuro agradeceras ese tamaño.Con unas extensiones de energía ( Esos cables de colores que se conectan a la mother) se vería encantador pienso comprarle unas para que combine más con el gabinete.

as the title says...the interior becomes dusty over a short time ( close to the ground ""8cm off the ground"" )you can easily clean the front air intake by simply blowing air from your mouth on a downward angle and pick up the dust with your finger tips at the bottom...it's fun but the mesh let a lot of dust through ( dusty interior after 2 months )it has a good airflow but it's messy when used close to the ground

Collin,4.0,2021 18 June,"
Case is either too shallow or too short to fit a 280mm rad on in the top of the case. This may work better with motherboards with smaller heat sinks. I am using a x570 aorus master and in the top mount the rad hits the motherboard heat sinks. I was able to force it in but I could only get the front couple screws in, it is contacting the motherboard and at a bit of an angle. In hindsight, I should of got a 360mm rad. Other then that, this case is really nice. It's light and sturdy. The glass and and front mesh look great.

Me gusto demasiado el espacio y la atención al detalle para facilitar el armado, cinchos, bandas ya establecidas, pequeños canales por donde pasar los cables, postes previamente instalados, buenos materiales de pintura, bandejas de hdd muy fáciles de remover sin el uso de herramientas y buen espacio para refrigeración líquida y por aire, lo malo es que es complicado colocar los ssd si no es en las bandejas del hdd y que hay un espacio abierto por donde se pueden ver los cables traseros y es complicado esconderlos en esa zona.

5950x + Strix 3090 setup:Not gonna lie, I wanted a Fractal Torrent however this case really picked my interest. And Gamers Nexus review sealed the deal for me.Ordered it and 2 days later I started assembling.LOVE the front panel, LOVE the top panel and overall I love the case itself and it’s airflow. For 90$ you are getting a lot!Downsides (maybe my fault?):Second picture: had to use a really messy zip tie to hold my SSD. Why? My 1300w power supply is too large and I had to remove the storage side panel section to make room for the cables.So this one is maybe my fault

Budget friendly airflow case!Building in this case was a treat. Love the mesh on the front. Looks so much better in person though. The pictures really don't do it justice. The fans that are included work well, the RGB is exactly what you expect. The glass side panel is beautiful with the engraved lines.If I was to knock on one thing it would be the powersupply dust cover but if you have watched any reviews that should not be a shock. You also have to remember it does its job and its on the bottom so you don't see it. So its really hard to knock on that.Cable management was easy, I love that you can remove the hd bay for more room for cables. Because I use all SSD its just nice to have a little more room.I paired with the CoolerMaster MasterLiquid ML240L RGB V2 and ATX motherboard from MSI.Everything mounted great, looks great and is very functional.It looks greatIt has great airflowFor the price I can't give it anything by 5 stars.

Great value for the price. Good looking and well built. Fans work well and are fairly quiet.Pros:Feels well built and sturdy. All parts fit nicely into place. Cable management compartment is spacious and has nice rubber grommets and plenty of hidden holes for routing any cablesCase looks sleek and glass panel is a nice touch. RGB has a ton of settings and can be turned off entirely if wanted.Minor Cons:The RGB controller for the case isn't the best setup, the controller comes an input for an external switch but no wiring for it. I used the reset button and connected to that so the reset on the case controls the RGB instead of rebooting. Not a big deal for me because I don't use reset ever, but they could have included controls on the front panel.The metal mesh screen on the bottom can pop off easily when moving the case around. Not a big deal to put back on but can be a bit annoying when setting it up.

So ya, it's metal box that holds your PC components. The airflow is great, the stock fans could be better, but this is a cheap case so I didn't expect them to be premium.My main issue with this case is the lack of cable management room at the back. Please give us more space at the back, it's more difficult than normal to get the cables to fit.

Hagar,5.0,2021 20 December,"
I hadn't built a computer for a few years but was pleasantly surprised at how good these cases are for cable management and mounting SSDs, etc. I still miss having a Bluray drive installed so I'll have to find an external closure (which are suddenly ridiculously difficult to find and super expensive for some reason). I installed a new i5-12600K and motherboard in it with no issues and I added another Coolermaster Halo Duo fan to the CPU cooler and an exhaust fan in the back of the case, as well as a 120 mm to the top of the case (hard to see in the pic). I think two 140 mm fans at the top would probably be the best solution so I'll add those later.I think it needs at least the fan at the back to help balance the 3 fans pulling air in from the front. I am running the i5 and an older MSI 1660 Super (because I can't buy a video card!) and the CPU and other motherboard sensors average around 29-30 degrees, even with a mild overclock applied. It could probably use an RGB strip at the bottom since it's quite dark there. No issues running Gigabyte's RGB Fusion app to control all the fans - I daisy chained them all together so they are controlled as one (no need for the fan controller it comes with if you have an ARGB header on the motherboard).The only small item I don't like is that the power button is outlined in a solid white light and it would be nice if that was blue or even RGB addressable! I also noticed that the Coolermaster fans that the case comes with don't seem to color match with any other RGB lights I've added (different model of Coolermaster fans and light strips). Especially blue - the included fans are more purplish-blue but all other lights are the correct blue color. I may end up replacing those front fans but they're fine for now.Good case, good value!

"
Brando,4.0,2022 16 May,"
This is not one of those high efficiency cases designed to minimize space footprint and fan count. This is a case that works best with three intake fans at the front and that's what it comes with. There is enough room on top to mount a 280 mm radiator + fan and it clears (barely) my ram and VRM heat sinks. There is no vertical gpu mounting but there is side storage mounting. You can choose to mount the AIO fans outside the case and the radiator inside but the cut outs obstruct airflow for anything above 120 mm and the mounting is at the bottom front rather than top front of the case. Make sure to get an aRGB motherboard to go with it as the stock fans are spectacular. All in all, a pretty solid case. The hard plastic mesh in the front is good you can just wash and dry it.***Edit: I am very saddened to say that its only been half a week and one of the rgb fans led already out and its not the motherboard. Also the clip on psu filter falls off all the time and is easy to lose but small thing if you just tape it.. I will see if coolermastervis willing to warranty just one fan without me having to exchange the whole case.
"
Jeremy,5.0,2021 22 August,"
This is a very solid case. It’s easy to assemble and the argb fans look great. I didn’t have any issue with the screws unlike some of the comments and as long as you are careful with installation it shouldn’t be a problem.Only potential issue is that the fans are CM sickleflow 120, which have some bad reputation. They can get loud and may crap out more easily. The fans on default rpm have a low humming noise but decreasing their speed by about 5% solved the problem.

"
Richard Moniz,5.0,2021 4 October,"
This case has a high-end look and feel.There are some small sacrifices to keep costs low such as the use of screws to hold cards, and to take off the case panels, but for how often you use these features I find it easy to sacrifice on something like a screw. The glass panel is thick and sturdy. I did originally plan to use a 240mm AIO which didn't fit because I used a MicroATX motherboard which placed the RAM sticks up to tight to the top of the case. Didn't matter too much as I was still able to use 8 fans in total.

My motherboard (Asus Z270) only had a 4 pin RGB header which did not connect with the wires for the fans which I meant I had to use a sata cable to connect it, however my power bank didn't have enough sata which was really annoying and I was forced to get and use another powerbank. Other than that, the case was really nice to work with.

En lo que respecta a dimensiones para manejo de cables, capacidad de ventiladores, diseño y flujo de aire es en definitiva uno de los mejores gabinetes que hay en el mercado, lo único negativo es que los ventiladores argb de Cooler Máster realmente no son muy atractivos así que los cambie por un LL120 de Corsair pero la combinación de estos 2 productos definitivamente hace relucir los pros de este gabinete.

Muy buen producto. Trae soporte para radiador de hasta 360mm frontal y superior de 280mm o 320. Lamentablemente si pones un radiador en la parte superior te restringe para colocar un ventilador trasero.Tiene ranuras para 2 HDD y 2 SSD en la parte baja y para colocar otros 2 SSD.El unico detalle es el precio, si lo adquiers por menos de 1700 como en mi caso no lo dudes.A otro detalle es que debes montar primero la fuente porque te deja muy poco espacio para maniobrar si lo pones despues. O si quieres cambiarla después, te dara problemas al sacarla sin mover los HDD.

bought because read good reviews about this case, but in the first few minutes of using it, I noticed a weird clunking noise from one of the front fans, then it went away, but it was still making an unpleasant unstable high frequency noise, which is then amplified by the case, most likely a QA issue with the case fan, but I personally won't bother trying a second one out.And yes, I did make sure it was the case fans, unplugged all 3 and the noise went away, meanwhile the other RGB fans I bought are running without any strange noise.

 Es un muy buen gabinete, la única desventaja que le veo, es que los ventiladores no son 100% silenciosos, pero tampoco es que suenen como una turbina, si eres muy quisquilloso con el sonido de los ventiladores, mejor ve por otra opción. sin embargo no es ni molesto el ruido que hace. Otra cosa es que no cuenta con un filtro apara el polvo en la parte frontal, lo cual puede que entre un poco mas de polvo, sin embargo a mi en lo personal que no vivo en un área en donde entre mucho polvo, para mi no es problema. El gabinete es un deleite visual!!!

Nice aesthetic and plenty of space will fit the chunkiest GPUs. Easy cable management thanks to cutouts for your cable ties. PSU air intake filter is somewhat cheap, simply a rectangular piece of mesh. 360mm radiator on top can be a tight fit especially if you have a fan in the back as the cables for the case IO also occupy the same spaceUpdate: One of the fans that came with the case started to produce a rattling noise, faint but audible

Este gabinete es realmente grande y sus 3 ventiladores ARGB son de la misma marca y vienen con múltiples colores y algunos estilos pre seleccionados.El único detalle es que los cables de los ventiladores hacia tu tarjeta madre y demás son delgados y lucen algo frágiles además de cortos, el controlador del ARGB es igual de corto y tendrás que arreglartelas de alguna manera para colocarlo dentro del gabinete y aún así quedará colgando por ahí.Algo que deberás tener en cuenta es que los cables del ARGB se pueden desconectar incluso cuando ya pusiste la tapa trasera, puedes ponerle algo de cinta para que se queden en su lugar o quizás un cincho.

Bonito diseño, el vidrio templado lateral tiene unas líneas que convergen con las del panel frontal, los tres ventiladores que incluye son ARGB por lo que los efectos de iluminación son aún más personalizables y únicos, me gustó el espacio interior y la forma en que puedes colocar los SSD, no me gustó el espacio para manejo de cable, ni lo cercano de las bahías de los HDD de 3.5 de la fuente de poder, tampoco incluye ventilador trasero, que a mi parecer es muy importante, yo te recomiendo estas dos opciones: https://amzn.to/3p4S2bx (el que yo le coloqué) o este otro https://amzn.to/3p5vaZuOtra cosa que no me termino de gustar fue la poca calidad de los filtros de la fuente y de la parte posterior, lo mejor sin duda el diseño, ventiladores frontales, monturas ssd y el vidrio templado.

El gabinete en general esta muy bien hecho no presenta problemas, es excelente pero la forma en la que la sección donde van los discos duros esta construida y ensamblada es muy mala debido a que la vibración normal de los discos duros se transfiere al resto del gabinete de tal forma que suena muy fuerte la vibración , se escucha como si tus discos furos estuvieran dañados pero no están dañados están bien es la vibración de gabinete la que se transfiere de esa manera, debo moverlo cada rato hasta que deja de sonar y luego vuelve a sonar y así todo el tiempo. estoy probando formas para que el contacto entre los soportes y el gabinete no hagan esos ruidos por que muchas veces te dan un buen susto. es el único detalle del gabinete en mi experiencia, por lo demás esta excelente

bought this for my white build and it looks really nice. the case feels nice and smooth and its light but you can tell it’s made of quality material. ventilation is really good which is something i was looking for, and its super easy to install everything. for me personally it was just a tiny bit small but i was able to work around it anyways. all the ports work well and everything tho.

Was looking to replace an old stock PC case to fit a new PSU and bought this for the room/space it provides. Was easy to setup albeit a time-consuming and tedious process. Does not require and tools apart from a flathead screwdriver and is designed to fit any motherboard. I was not able to get the front USB ports to work but I am pretty certain that's related to my old motherboard vs the case itself. Lights were a bonus. And with some testing my PC is now running 20 degrees celsius less on idle, which is surprising.

Using this enclosure for a gaming PC. My son swapped out the internal guts from his old case and put it in this case. Took him all day to do it (he's never done it before) and asked for my help a few times. The instructions seemed to be easy to follow.This is a great afternoon project. If you don't know what you're doing, or not comfortable with this kind of job, get a friend to do it for you. Overall, a nice case, great air flow to cool the chips and nice flashing lights.

So you get what you pay for.To start, it looks all right but the sound quality is poor. I got another small child's keyboard half the size that honestly sounds better for $15. Also, this thing gets LOUD. We had to put tape over the on/off button because whenever it's turned on/off by young kids, the volume (for some reason unbeknown to GOD) resets at *10* instead of 1, so it is incredibly loud EVERY. SINGLE. TIME, and needs turned down all the way down back to 1. Not even sure why it goes up so high, because honestly 1 is a perfectly acceptable volume on this thing for indoor use. This thing easily doesn't need to go above 4/5 but it goes to 10! So, that's fun. And don't think about karaoke, the microphone is incredibly cheap and when the kids play with it talking/singing loudly while pressing the microphone directly on their lips (as kids do) it is DEAFENING, even when the piano volume is set down as low as it can go.Besides that, neither keyboard really worked properly. The first I ordered about a month before Christmas with all the other gifts because I was worried about supply chain issues. So we didn't open it and use it until it was almost too late to return. Within just a couple days of opening and only a few normal uses, the left speaker started fuzzing loudly to the point normal play was intolerable. It would stop if you lightly struck it, but just for a minute but then slowly come back just as loud as before. It wouldn't stop unless you bonked it again. So it was unusable. Thankfully we were still within the return window but by then all the boxes had been trashed.Should have known better!After I had already returned it, I read the return paper (yes, that was my mistake, but even if I had read it beforehand there was nothing I could have done about it). It said it HAD to be returned in it's original box AND packaging. If it was returned in anything larger we'd face up to a 50% (yep, 50!) ""repackaging"" fee. And of COURSE, the place we had to return it, UPS, only had one box big enough to fit it (everything else was too small for the dimensions) and that huge box alone cost us $30. So if they do charge us that 50% fee, plus the cost of the box we had to buy to return it, we may as well have just paid for a second one! Can't wait to hear from them about that, because I will not be happy or kind if they try to charge that fee. Who in the world would keep such a large box around? I think we kept it for a couple days (trashed it *before* the speaker started fuzzing) but we unfortunately live in a small trailer and don't have room to store that kind of stuff more than a few days.Anyway, I had hoped the replacement would be ok, but I probably should have known better.Within minutes of plugging it in, it shut off then instantly turned back again (and up to full volume! YAY!). This happened several times over the course of just a few minutes of play so I was CONSTANTLY having to turn down the atrociously loud volume. I assumed I didn't fully connect the adapter plug all the way in to the keyboard or wall. But I checked and nope, the plug was fully plugged in to both. So it has some sort of loose or jiggly wire/part inside or a connective issue internally with the adapter/jack. I was about to return it too but avoided the chore for a few days. Luckily over the past week it seems to not be happening anymore. So we are keeping it (for now). Still I'm freaked out something electrical is wrong with and am nervous about leaving it plugged in. And I really don't want to face the hassle of returning at this point, even though I saved the box and Styrofoam packaging this time) in case it gets worse or some other issue pops up. Which really would not surprise me.Anyway, it's been a very unpleasant experience all around and I absolutely wouldn't recommend this keyboard to anyone at all, ever. If I had to do it again I would definitely spend an extra few hundred dollars on a good, quality keyboard and probably go to a music store so we could try it out first to make sure it didn't have any annoying features and actually had some semblance of quality. My advice is just steer clear of this, it was a pretty big waste and a hassle to boot.

The quality just fit it’s price. As a beginner, If it is for kid, it has everything that necessary to play. If you are a adult, it is enough for learning until your skill improves and get a better one since it is cheap.I am new with piano too，I feel the sound quality is pretty nice. Maybe the expert will says it has bad and trash sound, but since I have no way to extinguish its sound compare with the sound from professional piano, I could only judge its sound based on my feeling, it’s good.Here are some little details about it, including good and bad:1. The volume control is good, the smallest volume can almost control on one room, while the loudest sound you can heard from one floor away.2. It is come with a speaker, but there is no place to put the speaker. By the same reason, there is place to hold a headphone if you have one.3. The weight of it is very light, I guess it will break so easy if falling to the floor. So be careful.4. There’s no user guide about how to assembly the components into a piano stand. This is take time to figure out the right way. If you feel something wrong about your stand, that probably because some mistakes you make when you put them together.5. The piano comes with a clean keyboard with no letter on it, but they provide letter stickers. You have to put them on by yourself. Maybe some people don’t need letters on keyboard, but Since I am a beginner, and it’s type piano is mostly for beginner, so I need the letters on keyboard anyway, I would like the factory has the letters on the keyboard already.6. I haven’t try how it connects to other digital device, maybe you can find out on someone else’s views.

Santa brought this for my music-loving 6yr old daughter for Christmas. 🎅🎁🎄It is exactly what she wanted!!!I poured through different keyboards and reviews for hours before settling on this one. I'm so glad I went with this one. It is fabulous for a child or beginner. Everything works as it should. The sound is good. It has lots of great functions and features and is a good size.Sure, a musician who expects top notch sound and fuction might want a higher quality keyboard, and should probably fork out the several hundred / thousands for top-of-the-line instruments. 🤷🏼‍♀️ If you're looking for professional grade, this isn't it. I mean.... it is kind of odd to see people rating a $150 keyboard as ""junk"" 🤔 as if they expected something amazing at this price point.  Like, you wouldn't buy a $500 1999 Ford Focus and expect it to perform like a 2020 Mercedes Benz would you? No... you can't even compare the two. You get what you pay for.It is plastic, light-weight, definitely not a top-notch professional piece of equipment. But it works wonderfully in every way it should and is perfect for my little girl.  I play on it with her as well and I enjoy it too. 😊 it is large enough that we can play ""Heart and Soul"" side by side.  💞We are definitely happy with our purchase and I highly recommend this keyboard for other children or adults who want a low price keyboard that does the job without breaking the bank.Thanks Santa!!!! 😍

Jenna,4.0,2020 5 June,"
I'm in my twenties and decided I wanted to learn piano so I got this to see if it would be something I'm interested in. It's been good for me to learn on. The key size is a little smaller than a standard piano. It is off-tune and the sound quality isn't superb, so if you have a musical ear that may drive you nuts. It's off enough that apps that require you to hit a note to continue won't pick it up as the right key. Also the sound automatically is max volume every time you turn it on.  The stand was completely skewed for me, so I didn't end up using the stand at all. Also the stand for the music snapped off when I tried to put it in. It is really light which has been nice.This has been a good tool for me to see if I want to invest in a better keyboard in the future if I actually use it, but isn't something I would want to use for an extended time.If you are looking for something to tinker around with, this is a good option. If you are serious about learning piano and want a long investment, I would look for something a little more pricey.

A microphone and adjustable-height stand, the letter-notes above some of the keys useful when using beginner song books; it all worked for her. Well pleased with purchase.

Deaton,4.0,2020 8 April,"
I've just begun learning to play piano, and this keyboard is exactly what I was looking for to help me out! For the reasonable price, you get the keyboard, the stand, a (low quality but usable) microphone, and stickers to label all 61 of the keys. The stickers are without a doubt one of the biggest bonuses in my eyes, as it helps beginners learn where on the keyboard all notes are at. Plus, there's volume control, various timbres and rhythms, and even drum noise options included. While the sound quality isn't necessarily perfect compared to higher priced keyboards, it is still very clear and accurate. If you're looking for something reasonably priced to get you started in learning to play, this is the keyboard for you!

A. Mangini,5.0,2016 17 October,"
This item offered me pretty much all I wanted in a low priced electronic instrument that would sit on either side of my piano and offer me a large selection of tones and rhythms. As a bonus I can record whatever I want. Sometimes I add rhythm to my playing, other times a particular tone that mimics the emotion of the piece I am playing, still other times I can go to straight electronic playing because there are five octaves of keys with lots of room for both hands, furthermore I can go right hand electronic chords and play left hand on my grand. I play for myself so I don't need pro stuff. I like to improvise and experiment for my own pleasure and it doesn't cost me an arm and a leg. Speaking of legs; there's no foot pedals. You need to pre-set everything for every song, which does not bother me. The volume is plenty powerful: So far with right hand on piano cords and left hand on the electric keyboard I only need volume set at level 3. This baby will keep you busy for quite a while. Have fun playing your favorite tunes.

This was for my daughter at Christmas. After a house fire a few years ago, we discovered the piano was not salvageable.  My daughter loved playing the piano and missed having one.  She lives in smaller quarters now, so I got her this keyboard for Christmas.  She is absolutely delighted and has been playing it just about every day.  I wish I could have gotten her a full piano, but since I could not, this was a wonderful second-best.

This is my third time purchasing this particular keyboard. I have now over the past four years bought one for each of my daughters. I had bought one at first four years ago, and then two years later my second daughter wanted a keyboard. So I asked my first daughter how hers was doing and she said still works great! So bought the next one. Then this last year my third daughter wanted a keyboard. So I asked both other daughters how it was holding up and they both said they worked great still. So I have now purchased the tired one for third daughter. So it has sustainability and quality for the price! Thank you for such a great product!

olyjan,4.0,2017 19 July,"
Bought this for 14 year old grandson who is percussionist in school band.  He plays it every day - as practice for 'bells', and mallet instruments, since keyboard is same.  It is a good substitute for these expensive instruments that most people don't have in their homes.  For us, the 'downside' is only that there are too many 'bells and whistles'.  He pushed all the buttons maybe once and then picked  2-3  'sounds' that were relevant to his need.  This keyboard is sturdy, grandson thinks the 'keys' feel much like our piano.  So, for the price it was a good choice.  If you have an advanced student or need quality sound, you will need to spend lot's more money - but it's music, eh?  it's worth it!

It's often said you get what you pay for. I was not expecting a top of the line product. In fact I was aware that I was just selecting this option because I thought it was a bargain. But some features were not only limited but also a little bit upsetting. For example the volume, it defaults to maximum. You adjust it to a more tolerable level (I live in an apartment and have to take into account the presence of other inhabitants in the building) and leave it unused for 10 min and it's back again to maximum.In general I think this is a good starting keyboard for kids that want to play around for a while, but I don't recommend it if you are planning to be a little bit more serious with music.

Amazing! This key board is the first I’ve ever played on, the microphone and music stand is made cheaply and out of easily breakable plastic, other than that it comes with stickers to place on the keys to learn the notes also comes with a bunch of songs built in and a recording option, for the most part I love it!

Volume is REALLY loud, and when you turn it on it defaults to the loudest volume. Even on the lowest volume it’s loud enough to wake the whole house. The buttons are not entirely intuitive. As a toy, it’s totally fine if you’re OK with the volume issue, but not much more.

Joseph,1.0,2022 19 January,"
So i am a music major who is doing class piano to satisfy my credits. I am a complete beginner to piano but i know how a piano should feel and play, this is not it. Sound quality is terrible, keys are sticky and bad, cords that come with it are flimsy and worst of all, the key issue. The amazon Key issue seems to be a trend with this keyboard and i got this just before seeing this. Well i can side with those who have that issue because it is real. And thats not even the most annoying thing. Terrible sound and sticky keys are the worst thing a pianist can experience.In conclusion, its better to pay that extra 30 dollars for that 120 dollar piano than it is to buy this piano for a beginner. Buy the better one now so that you can last longer

I bought this for my mom's 94th birthday.  She used to have a large, good quality organ that she played frequently, but it would not fit in the assisted-living apartment where she lives now. From what I can see, this piano is fine for learning to play, for practice, and for the pianist's own enjoyment.  It is lightweight, which is both a blessing and a curse: it is easy to move when necessary, but it is also likely to topple.For the price, it is a good purchase.

Wendy Totten,1.0,2019 2 December,"
I bought this for my wife for an early Christmas gift, and this is honestly the first time I've ever asked someone to return the gift I got them.  I had a Casio back in the 90's that cost 60 dollars which sounded better than this thing did.  The stand/mic and included key lables were of terrible quality and honestly the manufacturer should've skipped the extras and went for a better quality instrument.  My issues with this product were:- The keys are toy-like- Terrible sound quality on both the instruments and melodies.- An ever present hiss and static coming from both the speakers and audio out at all times which increases with volume increase.- A extremely loud pop comes from the speakers and audio out when the power button is pushed.- The microphone is just downright terrible- The included key lables peeled after day one even though I used rubbing alcohol/ammonia and a micro fiber cloth to ensure the plastic was properly prepped.I'm returning this and getting the Alesis Melody 61 MK 2.  It's cheaper overall since the shipping is free and the product comes with some nice extras as well as having far better sound quality.Bottom line, you can do better for less with the Alesis.  Even a beginner will be frustrated with this product.

My 6yo LOVES this! I purchased it because of the mic, which my daughter loves. She enjoys using all the pre-set rhythms. I also ordered the stick on notes for the keys, which is great for learning. Only complaint is that I couldnt figure out how to strap keyboard to the stand. Seems like that might be an option, but directions weren't clear. I also didnt realize when I purchased that it doesnt come with power cord and didnt want to use all the batteries. Luckily I had a cord that fit lying around that works.

The on off button when pushing in with your finger to turn on, goes in further than it should.My 87 year old mom turned it on and now has np way of turning it off.  The button fell inside the piano.I have no way of getting it out so she has to unplug it to turn it off.  I tried returning it but was told it was too late.False advertising... it was advertised as a piano/organ.  When mom got home from rehab and we opened it up, found out that it is ONLY a piano.  Mom was in the hospital for 2 weeks and then in rehab for 3 weeks, so we can't return it.Total waste of money.I wrote to the seller weeks ago and have heard nothing back.
"
Riccarda,3.0,2016 2 December,"
I bought this because I recently moved to America for 12 months and I didn't want to give up on playing the piano completely. I bought this in an offer for 75$ and for that price I'm okay with it. It does its job. Obviously nothing compared to a real piano. However, I would never pay the original price for it cause its definitely not worth more than 100$! It feels pretty cheep and I'm not sure if it will last for long. The sound doesn't sound anything like a piano. You can still have fun with it and as of now  (one day after I received it) I don't regret buying it. Delivery was very fast
"
Florey Ramos,5.0,2020 12 February,"
I got this as a Christmas gift and its really cool. I don't know if its just me but when you press the keys on the higher parts, it sounds weird like its being blocked by something. Overall it is a great gift and great for beginners like myself.
"
Jimmathy,2.0,2021 25 December,"
ive had mine for about a month now, but about two weeks in, it got harder to press certain keys. Db in middle c is the most problematic because it has to be pressed almost all the way to work
"
Nancy,3.0,2018 24 January,"
I bought this specific model because of the music holder, but I am very disappointed in it. It is really flimsy and very short, wont hold a normal piece of music or a lesson book. Keys feel ok, and sound is good, just wanted something to play that was small, portable, won't be using all the bells and whistles. It is a nice size for my purposes. Want to practice without driving the neighbors nuts.I paid for an accident protection plan, but don't have any information about what to do if I have any problems with the keyboard. Can you help me with that????
"
YellowArtist91,4.0,2018 6 October,"
I love this piano for early learners. I bought this Keyboard for my daughter and it makes its job, although I don’t completely like the electronic sound of a couple of keys (the rest sound good). As I said for children and early learners is a very good investment.
"
Gian Carlo,3.0,2017 27 June,"
This keyboard is ok. I'm fine with it since i'm a beginner who is just trying to learn the basics and fundamentals of how to play a piano. For the price I paid for, I didn't expect too much. The one thing that bugs me with this piano is at a certain note and the corresponding notes after it, there is a loud almost like a high frequency sound that I hear. It is annoying and bothersome but for now this piano is fine but I will be upgrading to a better piano sooner or later. Also the stand is not even. One side is longer than the other.
"
Erick Dallas,4.0,2019 20 May,"
For anyone trying to play piano for fun can get this. The sounds of the notes are ok, just the speakers sound cheap. I recommend if anyone wants to actually want a good piano needs to find a better quality.
"
Tim Snyder,3.0,2020 22 March,"
Remarkably cheap construction. I bought this to help me learn the violin. I use it to tune the violin, and to play certain phrases to make sure I am playing in tune on the violin. It does the job for that. I can’t speak regarding its other features. It does not have full-size keys.
"
Feonix,1.0,2017 28 July,"
Okay so I had problems with this keyboard immediately after setup.First thing I noticed is that the stand does not sit perfectly on a hard surface so there is rocking back and forth, which will just not do with a keyboard.Secondly, the sound quality was horrible. I used headphones (nice over the ear ones) and the speakers built in with the machine and the quality of the sound was just horrible.Thirdly, and most importantly, the keys on this thing are as cheap as ever. I'd say about 10 of the keys do this strange thing. When I push down on them to play they go straight down then shift to the left a bit. This causes it to come into contact with the key next to it and it gives you a grinding sound and makes it hard to play 2 white keys that are next to each other at the same time.I highly suggest you move on and try another keyboard if you want any sort of quality at all. If you want to get one as cheap as possible this might be okay for you but you get what you pay for I suppose. I thought $80 was semi decent for a keyboard but I was wrong.
"
Rlampy,4.0,2018 7 February,"
I bought this as a gift for my daughter.  She loves it and so do I.  She can put in earbuds with it and practice without all of us having to hear those off keys.  Plus she has already learned to play 5 or 6 songs since Christmas.
"
K. H. Garrett,4.0,2020 22 January,"
It worked and I didn't have to send back like the last and fight the seller.
"
Jaye,4.0,2018 7 January,"
I had to deduct one star just because it feels like a plastic toy and the instructions are stupid. But the sound is good and it is a very easy setup. For the money, it is a great buy.
"
Mandi,5.0,2019 2 January,"
I bought this for my daughter as a gift and she loves it! She has played it every day since we bought it. It has plenty of nice features and has great sound quality. I love the adjustable volume and love that you can plug headphones in so that we don’t have to listen to it 24/7. We are very happy with this purchase.

Very good for the Money.

CLANDAVERDE,5.0,2020 27 June,"
Bought it for the kids and myself for learning and so far its been great. Sound quality is good and easy to assemble. The packaging is also great.
"
sandra j.,5.0,2016 21 December,"
Bought 2 of these for my twin daughters for Christmas so I have not seen or heard them at full function yet. I did open one up to check out and I really do think they will be pleased. We have a baby grand piano so they wanted a keyboard to practice up in their rooms before presenting us with a concert and I do believe they will want to play these for the concert verses the baby grand. CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!
"
Tasha Cleveland,4.0,2018 29 January,"
Bought this for my daughter who wanted to learn piano. She's taught herself snd needed something that would allow her to continue. So far this product has met all of my expectations. Didn't like the microphone, but she's not much of a singer anyway.
"
Jerae David,5.0,2019 27 December,"
Stickers came with the keyboard for beginners and there are a lot of fun features like the sample beats and sample songs. Very fun to play with and I'm excited for my niece and nephew to start learning chords and songs!
"
RaCy,5.0,2019 17 May,"
The keyboard arrived on time, it was a gift for my favorite little one and she was delighted. The sound is great quality and the micro phone is good for children’s use. This is an excellent way to interest young children in learning piano.  Great value for the cost. I recommend this to everyone.
"
Leonor,4.0,2019 2 April,"
I guess this is good for its price. The sound is a bit off ans and the keys don't press down smoothly. Would recommend this for a beginner or a child.
"
Tim Post,4.0,2018 1 January,"
Daughter loves the one we got her, said she would give it a 5/5 if the keys had a softer tactile response and felt a bit less plastic-y. She's an intermediate player and said it's great for beginners or intermediate students alike.
"
Lakisha Hopson,5.0,2020 22 April,"
I bought this keyboard for my daughter cause she is learning how to play. It great for beginners and she loves all the features that it has on it.
"
Daniele,4.0,2019 20 February,"
Didn't care for the attachment system that holds the keyboard on stand but my daughter loves it! Worth the money for a beginner's keyboard. Can always upgrade later if interest grows!
"
Andrea,5.0,2021 6 January,"
Keyboard is great and quite simple. I recommend for both beginners and intermediate learners.
"
Christen rowles,5.0,2021 19 January,"
It's really nice, it is breakable with kids. But it's not super fragile.
"
Jennifer Anyanwu,2.0,2019 5 February,"
The piano looks nice and the volume can get really loud - which is good. My only issues are that it can only work when plugged into a wall, the sounds are pretty generic and off key, and the keys move to the side a lot instead of going straight down when you press it. I don't think it will last much longer, but it's definitely for beginners who need a cheap keyboard to start with. If you're more advanced - then spend more money on a Yamaha or something nice. I also like that you can change the sound of the keys (100+ options). But overall, I wouldn't recommend this mainly because of the super cheap keys that shift to the side when you use it. Get something that sounds less like a toy and more like a grand piano.
"
Maria,5.0,2021 2 March,"
No era lo que esperaba pero sirve para niños aprender
"
Ohitsandrew,3.0,2016 12 October,"
It is a good piece of equipment for what you're paying for, I do have to say that I don't really like the keys on it. The keys are very cheap and thin, they tend to rub against eachother once in awhile when you press on them at angle if you're playing long scale notes or playing fast. This is not a bad buy for a beginner piano player like myself. The microphone is very cheap too along with the stand. Overrall good for a begining piano player.
"
IOHAN,4.0,2017 2 January,"
I bought this product electronic piano as a gift for my grandchildren. I can not say exactly for its quality because they are living in another state, but they are happy with the gift. I can only say I'm happy with that delivery was made just in time.
"
Erica Ratliff,4.0,2016 26 December,"
Got this as a gift for my teenage daughter & so far she loves it. Good value for the price. I like that it has a lot of features & came with a stand, mic, headphone jack (that's verryyy important lol) & was a pretty decent size.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 5 February,"
This keyboard is outstanding! Great sound, easy to use and to move around. It also works on 6 AA Batteries so if you dont have a power source, you are good to go. Lots of nice features on it,  mic and a sturdy light stand. Great value for the money!
"
John G.,4.0,2018 28 February,"
Inexpensive, but it works well.  You can feel how light and cheap it is in terms of hardware, but my son bought it with his money and loves it, sounds good and works reliably.
"
Godfrey,4.0,2017 22 July,"
Sounds great! but the Microphone doesn't work well as quality Mic, the set screws are missing from the package. It will be better if ther will be a free trial subscription for piano lessons at least for a couple of months.
"
Robert Johnson,5.0,2019 28 January,"
We gave this as a gift to my 13 year old nephew and he loves it. It has so many features for the size of the piano/organ. This is a great gift to give to someone looking to learn an instrument. Very reasonable price for the complexity of the item
"
Kate Fairley,4.0,2018 10 October,"
My son loves this. The only issue is that the minimum volume is still really loud. And the default volume when you switch it on is very loud.
"

I know nothing about keyboards but bought this one for my 5yr old granddaughter for Christmas. I have set it up and pushed the keys and play the added tunes and songs. Sounds perfect to me and I feel it is well built. I think I did very good selecting this keyboard, stand and microphone for the price.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2016 31 December,"
This is my first keyboard and it's excellent! It's very light so moving it from place to place, is a snap.  It also handles my little ""tornadoes"" as they think they are music prodigies. They are 1, 3, and 5.  The day that I received it, I immediately started messing with it and 30 minutes later, I could play ""house of gold"" by the 21 Pilots!!!!
"
Mitchell F,2.0,2017 8 November,"
I have to be honest, I was excited to get this piano.The product came in yesterday, I was overly excited.Updated:Now I turned on the keyboard, there are issues already. They keys have a delay, and when recording, it cannot record playing 2 keys at once. it counts a 3 key not as 3 notes. I have done everything possible to get in contact, This isn't anything like yhou'd image it would be for the price.old:Then the stand came in within the same box.The nob for changing its height was broken.I felt kind of robbed because I paid for the full product. Now I will need a new stand or just return this piano.The piano works. It works for what you paid for. nothing more.
"
Kelly,3.0,2017 24 April,"
Item arrived in great condition. The keyboard and all of the features work great, perfect for those wanting to learn. Wish the adapter to plug-in was longer as it doesn't leave much space. Also, the stand is crooked and the keyboard does not fit properly on it, so I am unable to use. Overall for the functionality of the keyboard, it would be a 4-5 star product. As for the adapter and stand, 3 stars.

cdo do,5.0,2019 28 January,"
i did not find anything wrong with this unit...it does what it suppose to. only the knob on the table was broken in a little piece....but that was the fault of the delivery company not the product...so i still gave it 5 stars.
"
Matthew Smith,2.0,2017 28 September,"
Really, just all around a disappointment. It was much smaller than I had anticipated; the keys were not ""standard size."" It felt very cheap. The stand was really flimsy. It didn't sound good either. It had sort of a weird, childish, ""electric ting"" sound that felt closer to a toddler's toy than a piano. It was easy to return, however. They refund was issued promptly shortly after I dropped it off at UPS. Hopefully I will get the money back in my account in the next couple days and buy the Casio instead. If you are on the fence, I suggest you do the same. Even if you are just trying to learn how to play, the extra $40 is worth it.
"
Mary Louise,4.0,2017 31 July,"
Will take me awhile to learn all it can do, but after not playing the piano for 30 years having fun learning again.  For the money seems to be a good deal.

I seldom write review，but this time I could not help writing this cuz this keyboard is really beyond my expectations. It plays very comfortable and I can plug headphone so that it could be played even midnight. Awesome! Hope it could be durable!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 18 January,"
For the price it does the job just fine, it is very reliable, the keys are really bad compared to a most sophisticated keyboard but for the price you can't complain, for a kid that is just starting this would fit perfect.

"
Beverly Coveleski,5.0,2016 22 December,"
I have not touched a keyboard since the early '70's so I was looking for an inexpensive one with a stand and this fit the bill.  It is perfect for my needs with a nice sound.  The keyboard arrived earlier than expected and now it is being put to good use.  I highly recommend this for the amateur player.

"
Ty Valentine,3.0,2017 8 July,"
It's great for beginners, but still have a more electronic synth sound, no matter the timbre, even on the Acoustic Piano setting, it doesnt sound as organic and classic as I'd like it to, like say a grand piano would. Also the microphone isn't that great, not even for kareoke, and my piano stand is durable slightly unbalanced (creating a minor wobble effect).
"

The price for this is amazing I was happy to be getting a keyboard piano for the price but I'm absolutely disappointed that the keyboard does not sound like a real piano it sounds like a child's toy. I kinda want to send it back but don't want to go through the hassle at the same time

It's a very good price, and sets up nicely & pretty solidly. But it does sound ""tinny"" (electronic) to us. We can't find a setting (among over 100+ options!) that sounds close to a real piano, as we have been able to do on other electronic keyboards.

Amazing instrument. Does too many things to recount here, but it plays in over a hundred ways, has drums, can record and playbac,, etc. Truly phenomenal instrument!!!! Amazing value, for everything it does, it should cost at least double. I love it!!!!

NaN da MaN,1.0,2019 27 November,"
To sum it up, here’s a rhyme:It clearly wasn’t worth my time,Worth actually only a dime,I regret my purchase,And think this thing should be sent below the surface.Although it claims to have 255 rhythms,It has a mere 15 (which are cataclysms)I do not think it’s worth it’s cost,And would rather just get lost.I know no piano as crappy as this,Which is why, I’m in fact, making this diss.For its quality, I give it a solid 2/10,For the piece of garbage I have is a good device for no men.

CHA221,1.0,2020 25 December,"
Don't ever buy this. We are extremely disappointed. We bought this for our daughter for the Christmas. She opened the present in the morning and tried to play but there is no sound coming other than a grrrr sound and some static noise. We even tried with batteries thinking it could be the power adapter But no luck. It was definitely a defective one. This was the worst thing I ever bought from Amazon. It just ruined my daughter's Christmas, she was so sad coz her Christmas gift was not working.

John,1.0,2018 26 December,"
Serves me right for buying a musical instrument from Amazon I guess.  Bought as a Christmas gift for my niece,  she was very excited about it until she opened the box and found 3 keys broken or jammed or something,  then she was very disappointed.  I should of checked it before I gave it to her I guess,  that’s my bad, but now I’m out money for repackaging because I through away all the boxes,  I should get a refund for that to and the time invested in sending it back my time is valuable.

Amazon Customer,2.0,2018 26 January,"
So it is a electric piano. But it does not sound like one at all. It has several sounds it can do but very few sound like what they are supposed to. The Keys are very small (playable) and sometimes plays other notes. The stand it came with is nice and easy to assemble. But that’s probably the only good thing about it.

Sandy,1.0,2020 30 December,"
There were 7 keys they were pushed up and not working. Looking through the reviews I see a lot of other people having this problem. I was able to fix it by taking the back off and pushing them into place, but it was way too much work for the amount of money I spent on this. I wouldn’t recommend this product at all.

"
Bob,2.0,2017 28 November,"
The keys were shorter than I expected, but I suppose that's standard for the price of such a keyboard. But the worst part is the return policy. I have to pay $15 to ship it back, which I was not anticipating because that's never happened on an amazon prime product. Don't buy if you're not sure you want to keep this!

Max,2.0,2017 28 July,"
Honestly wasn't expecting the keys to be quite as small as they were.. this was a piano made for little people. Sounds pretty ""meh"" to be honest.. Not bad for the price, but definitely not good. If you are looking to seriously get into piano, this is not for you.. This is a product for playing around/ tinkering with..
"
Giselle,1.0,2020 25 March,"
As someone who plays the piano, this ‘piano’ if you can even call it that is just straight up trash. The sound quality is just horrible and the microphone is really cheap too, I mean you do get what you pay for... I’d only recommend this piano for children but not for people who want to learn how to play, if you do want to learn how to play, save some cash up and buy something nicer than this garbage.

Jesse S.,1.0,2020 15 July,"
Lighter than a laptop. If you turn the volume down the sound only comes thru one speaker. Sounds blown. Microphone is trash, sounds like talking over a loud speaker in a walmart 10 years ago. In total its all worth maybe 10$ at a yard sale. 1$ microphone 7$ keyboard 2$ stand. Actually the stand is the only thing i dont have a problem with.

Josie,1.0,2019 31 May,"
I bought this for Christmas so my daughter could learn how to play piano.  Not sure if they keys worked originally but at least 5 keys don't make any sound at all.  Sort of makes it difficult when you are learning piano.  I rarely review things on Amazon but this feedback needed to be heard.  I would return or exchange but I'm past the window.

Mark Stapleton,1.0,2018 30 December,"
Very upset with this product, I gave it to my son as a Christmas present and the description said that it came with a keyboard stand. We search and double checked all the boxes to find no stand anywhere to be found. If this product says in the description that it has something that comes with it then it should be there upon opening the box.
"
Mom of 4 Son Team,1.0,2017 11 November,"
Purchased this for my college son to have in his dorm, but it is way too small for his hands and the sound quality is so poor that he doesn't even want to play it.  Wish I'd realized this prior to the close of the return window.  Makes me to want to buy from a vendor with a better return policy.  Disappointed in this item and disappointed that Amazon doesn't give a bit more time for returns.

"
W. Skye,1.0,2017 10 May,"
This keyboard does not have any sort of dynamic response; that is, whether you hit a key softly, or if you hit it hard, or with a hammer, the tone comes out at exactly the same volume.  Even absolute beginners need the ability to at least attempt to play at a piano or forte volume level.  Tone quality is poor - you really have to use your imagination to convince yourself it sounds anything like an acoustic piano.  Don't waste your money.
"
Amy Butler,3.0,2017 12 May,"
The stand is lopsided and the bars on the stand are uneven.
"
Steven Giacoma,1.0,2017 4 August,"
Would give it 0 stars of it would let me. I wanted a keyboard and this was a cheap option with mostly good reviews. It came. It sucked. I threw it away. If you actually want to play music, then find a different keyboard even if it's more expensive. This one resets to highest volume every 7 minutes.

Tiffany Jetton,1.0,2019 1 May,"
This product is just sad. I didn’t have high expectations at all when purchasing, after all it’s under $100. But at a minimum I expected it to sound slightly like a piano. Instead it sounds more like a kids toy. It has over 100 sound options...but half of them sound exactly the same and all are laughable. Very disappointed.

Lower keys didn't hold the note, sound quality was poor overall and microphone was very ""breathy"".  All this, and they didn't send screws for the flimsy stand.  This is just not worth the money for anyone interested in a decent piano sound.  We invested a bit more and got a Yamaha 235 and it is a significantly better sounding and performing piano!!

The keys are too sensitive and on occasion play the note 2 or three times when only struck once. I am also surprised that Hamzer or their distributor Mix-Wholesale don't  supply a customer service or technical support contact number. Not good! Looks as if they don't stand behind their produduct. A bad buy, bad product, no customer service!

it feels like a toy quality. static noise from speakers that is worse when microphone is pugged in. when turned on it defaults to the loudest volume and does not remember the last volume setting. ordered new, received open box and missing two out of four bars that supposed to hold the stand in place rendering the stand of no use.

Got this as a starter keyboard for my kid and didn’t expect much, but this thing is a disappointment. For starters the 255 timbers/ tones all sound about the same; from violin to grand piano, they sound about the same. Every time you power it on the volume starts at 10. I’m hard of hearing and can hear tones from the headphones in the other room. I am constantly telling my kid to turn it down as he just goes with the default. So not good for beginners. The stand and seat are the only decent items from the keyboard kit. Do yourself, and youngsters, a favor and keep shopping.
"
JSM,4.0,2017 28 November,"
Quality for the price! Bought this for our grandson who's 5 and learning to play the piano. He needed a key board to practice and this has worked out great. Sturdy and has straps that secure board to the stand. The mic that comes with it is all plastic, but other than that I'm very satisfied with it. Sound and tones are great too. Has my recommendation.

I am disappointed that the volume is so high.  I purchased this for my 6-year g-grandson for Christmas.  Because there are other children in the house, I also purchased separately some earphones so he could play the piano and not disturb anyone else in the house.  When I turn on the piano, and plug in the earphones, the volume is so high, I am concerned for his ears.  I won't be there to monitor his use of this piano.  I may have to give him my personal keyboard.
"

This piano was a Christmas gift 2018 for my 16yr old daughter who loves music and musical theater. We didnt get to put up the stand that came with the piano up yet but it was included. It arrived earlier then expected, great quality and perfect for lots of practicing for a beginner. I highly recommend.

I needed a lower priced keyboard. I am retired and now I finally have time to learn to play piano/ keyboard. This keyboard is great.

Hamzer  should market many more models and they would be in the top 5 ratings. Thank you Hamzer.

christine,2.0,2016 28 October,"
First, whoever amazon used for delivery... they dropped it off at the wrong apartment but the older lady came to my door to tell me a package was at her house for me. I am glad I have honest neighbors. That did not have any affect on my review.I understand it's electronic. (My mom bought this as a birthday present. She didn't know there was a difference) but this plays like a child's toy piano.The stand IS flimsy. If you are playing and find that you are into your music just be careful because it might fall over. It is easy to put together though. Like 5 minutes. The mic is garbage for an adult but I think children would love it.I would not recommend this product for an adult.

Cheaply made keys, interference with sound when phone is near by, and no matter what setting you choose on the keyboard it will never sound like a traditional piano or ""normal."" Good for beginners though.

"
Josiah M Traeger,1.0,2020 29 March,"
The keys are small, my fingers can't fit throught the black keys so my playing is limited. The sound quality is pretty bad, I had a cheap Yamaha keyboard given to me and it was a lot better than this. Especially the fact that this keyboard can't use a pedal which takes away from the availability in dynamics in your playing.I'd say it's not worth this price. If you can get a different one then do so.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2016 29 December,"
This was a Christmas present for my husband who is learning to play. He has a beautiful voice and wants to record in the near future. He was actually looking at the same one unbeknownst to me. He was SUPER SURPRISED AND HAPPY!
"
Rachel Rose,2.0,2018 30 May,"
It’d just be nicer if they said it only had 15 sound options. Whether you pick rhythm or timbre, there are only 15 options that cycle through. Also the keys are small and it does feel like a toy. It’s a fine product if you just want to learn keys without paying hundreds of dollars. However, I’m unsure if there are also cheap options with better keyboards.
"
Susan R.,5.0,2017 16 October,"

"
Annalisa Hiroyasu,1.0,2020 15 January,"
After about 1 month, the sound on the keyboard completely shut off. I wasn’t able to fix it. The keyboard itself would turn on but no sound could be heard, even with headphones plugged in. Right before the sound shut of. There was a spark noise from inside the keyboard and a weird smell coming from inside. Would not recommend for long term use.
"
Anonomys,2.0,2017 7 December,"
The price may be very tempting, but I would not buy this keyboard. The stand is not the best, the sound this product produce sounds very buzzy, and don't get me started on the keys. They all feel like loose teeth and are as light as a feather. The quality is quite poor, and I am just saying: It will save you money in the long run to get a different keyboard. This one is not good what so ever.

Haley,2.0,2018 18 March,"
It definitely does a lot of things but in my opinion should have spent more time focusing on sound quality than the 255 outdated rhythms and demo songs... but for a cheaper keyboard it gets the job done...

I didn't receive the screws. I paid extra for the stand, only to not be able to use it.
"
Amazon Customer,2.0,2017 25 March,"
Decent for the price we paid. Got it for my cousin (16 yrs) and she loved it upon opening. It did not come with the screws and Allen wrench. Keys are flimsy and the sound is sub par.

"
EliteReviewsUSA,4.0,2019 28 October,"
Generally cheap piano and the quality of it's build is not that great. It's pre-loaded with a lot of instruments, which is pretty nice actually. The mic is complete trash and feels like a $3 toy.Some of the settings for recording were too complicated and ended up not working a few times. I wish I bought something a bit more pricey and of quality.

"
Lisa,5.0,2022 16 September,"
It’s the cutest little bike. Comes with the tool needed to assemble. Super easy to assemble. Took my husband like 5 min. We got it for our grandbabys first birthday.

I bought this for my 1 year old nephew. It was easy to assemble and the quality felt great. We put him on it, he took one step and it fell over-- he cried. He wanted nothing to do with it after that. I think over time he will get it, but beware...a helmet is necessary especially in the beginning!

"
Myla,3.0,2022 4 October,"
Item was described as having a “damaged box” when in actuality the item had been completely opened to the point where screws were missing and I had to go to buy some to properly and SAFELY assemble and likely even used as the handles were discolored../ a complete rip off
"
pb909,5.0,2022 18 July,"
This was a birthday gift for my granddaughter, she's one.  She is just learning to take steps but is able to get on this and move it with her feet.  She also likes to stand in front of it and push it.  It's a little tippy so someone always walks with her.  Remember to adjust the height of the seat!
"
James Prive,5.0,2022 31 August,"

"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2022 26 August,"
Bought this when grand daugther was 14 months and she didn't play with it, but knew it was hers and just carried it around a little. Surprisingly she started to sit on it recently and push it along (22 months). She seen other toddlers a bit older ride this type of bike and she kind of took it upon herself to try it out. We'll see how she plays with this now, but she's almost outgrown it!
"
Dr. Kelsey,3.0,2022 7 August,"
I bought this for my daughter at the end of May for her first birthday. She didn’t figure it out well and wasn’t interested. I brought it back out 8 weeks later and she’s much more interested. But she’s taller and the seat needs to be adjusted. The screw to adjust the seat is basically impossible to remove. So this bike is honestly completely useless.I still gave 3 stars because it has potential to be awesome. I wish it was easier to contact sellers and get help. My daughter is ready to ride this but it can’t be adjusted.

"
Brian Schroeder,3.0,2022 29 August,"
I have a few models of these bikes and I will say, this is the kids least favorite. It’s not as easy to glide on as the bikes with 2 rear wheels close together. This one just collects dust, while the other style of these balance bikes at the house are used non stop.

"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2022 12 August,"
I wish this adjusted to bigger sizes, but it’s really just for brave 1 year-olds. My 2 year-old barely fits on it.
"
Allyson Small,4.0,2022 23 February,"
This balance bike says for 12 month olds. I would say it’s good for 18+ month olds due to height of the lowest setting and coordination. Other than that, the light pink is adorable and it glides smoothly across the floor.
"
JLN,5.0,2022 16 June,"
Purchased for my one year old niece’s birthday. She isn’t walking yet but got up on the bike and was pushing herself around. The balance wheel on the back will be great to gain stability. Highly recommend.
"
D. Leazer,3.0,2022 12 May,"
Bought this because it said like new.  When it arrived the box was faded which didn’t matter as long as the item was in good working condition. The box had also been taped and retapped numerous times. After opening and trying to assemble we found that there were multiple parts missing. This is the reason it has been taped and returned time and time again. This also tells me that someone isn’t reading why the item is being return.  I gave it a 2 star for assembling because of the missing parts. If they were all there it would have been very simple. As for sturdiness it would be better if it had two wheels in the back especially for a one year old.
"
Christina Marie Nichols,3.0,2022 15 August,"
Easy to assemble and adjust.  However a helmet should have been included at this price.
"
Kimberley,4.0,2021 21 December,"
Great bike and easy to assemble. He likes it, however he is a bit too big for it. He is tall for just turning two . It would be nice if handle bars raised as well! Will be better for the next grandchild. Parents are over six feet tall. He is not the average two year old height,so had I bought this around 18 months, he would have been shorter!
"
Gigi,4.0,2022 21 January,"
I bought this for when my baby granddaughter grows. So we will see. The seat seemed hard and narrow. I would think uncomfortable but we will see if she likes it. I will update later on. It was well made and sturdy though.
"
Mary,5.0,2022 20 March,"
Very sad how flimsy the bike it. It was finally warm enough this past week to take it out, rode it maybe 5 times and the wheel fell off. No way to get the bearing back on and make it sturdy again to use.
"
Jared M.,5.0,2022 12 February,"
My 18month old loves this bike! She is average in size and rode it on the first try. I like that the seat is adjustable, as some others are not, which is why we bought this one. Definitely worth the money for the 6months or so that she’ll use it and then pass on to the thrift store or a friend!
"
kim5875,3.0,2022 2 May,"
This is so cute and I was hoping my child could use it to scoot around but the single wheel in the back causes it to tip very easily. If you’re considering one of these, I would recommend going for one that has 2 wheels in the back
"
Michelle DeRicco,5.0,2022 13 February,"
My 15 month old has been trying to use her bike. We use it inside on carpets for now because she does tend to fall off but she’s getting the hang of it. I’m sure by the time she’s 18 months, she will be a pro. Great purchase.
"
Taylor,2.0,2022 15 October,"
My daughter had a hard time with this bike. The handle bars should be a bit higher for better balancing/stability. Design needs to be worked on a bit.
"
Caitlin,5.0,2022 26 March,"
This is my one year old’s favorite toy. He figured out how to use it himself after 3 tries. I do wish the seat was adjustable.
"
Amanda E,5.0,2020 10 August,"
My one year old daughter loves this bike. It took her a couple of days to figure out to sit down on the seat. She’s 31 inches tall and it’s a good height for her. Would work for a shorter or taller child too.  She rides it through the house and over to the front door and asks us to take her outside with it. It’s very low to the ground and lightweight, so when she has occasionally tipped over on it she doesn’t fall hard and nothing on the bike hurts her. She definitely doesn’t comprehend steering or turning, yet. She pushes it along until she bumps into something then waits for us to turn her in a different direction. I think it’s going to be great to teach her some basic bike skills like steering and balance before we actually get her a real bike.
"
Cynthia Light,5.0,2022 10 May,"
I like it !
"
Kyli Bedinghaus,4.0,2021 14 April,"
My daughter is 17 months old. She really seemed to like it at first but then it falls over when she tries to get off of it and so she's a little leery of it. It was easy to put together but my husband accidentally put the handlebars on backwards and we had to go through quite a bit to get them back on the right way. That was our fault though. Overall I'm hoping that she will like it when she gets a little older.
"
C-Bus,5.0,2020 28 January,"
I’m so happy with this purchase. I waffled between this 3 wheel bike or a 4 wheel. My 17m old is very speedy & comfortable on his current 4 wheel bike but it’s very light weight plastic & doesn’t have the ability to steer easily. I worried he’d struggle too much with this one & not be interested, but, also, didn’t want to not challenge him if he was ready. He’s GREAT on it! He got on & wobbled a little, fell once, and then was all over the place. He’s tumbling a few times but he gets on again & loves this bike so so much. I wouldn’t recommend it for a child who’s not already established on a 4 wheel bike but if you think your kid is ready for a challenge this is a great place to start. The handle bar turns a little, the wheels are smooth and it very simple to assemble.
"
Linda,5.0,2022 12 April,"
Bike is easy to assemble and very sturdy
"
Mike,4.0,2020 2 June,"
Bike was extremely easy to assemble. Just connect handles to the bike and tighten down with the provided allen wrench.Tried dropping the seat, but couldn't. The tube allowing seat adjustment is flared inwards at the end (to allow easier drop in), so it can be filed down while keeping the same max height.My friend's daughter could barely reach the ground with her toes. She is a year old, but she is short for her age. This will not be a problem for most. She will grow into it or she can wear shoes and be able to reach it better. My friend may grind down the seat tube to lower it more.
"
texasqueen,5.0,2021 25 August,"
This was a birthday gift for my 1 year old great granddaughter. It was very simple to assemble it took minutes. As soon as she saw it she was on it an scooting herself down the hall. One great feature is that the handle bars turn in a slightly restricted manner that helps avoid spills caused by abrupt turns. I ordered the pink and white the color was vibrant. All in all this was a well received gift.
"
JB,5.0,2021 30 December,"
We can’t separate little man from this thing. Our son is 16 months. Light enough for him to pick up and move it but sturdy enough for sister, who is almost 5. He loves it and is already zooming.

I had gotten a similar balance bike for my nephew (13m) which was really awesome. This one was a little different, which was ok cause my daughters (18m) a little older. Its pretty easy to assemble, but my nephews was so much easier. And its not as sturdy as my nephews, as this only as 3 wheels instead of 4, but my daughter really likes it and it helps her learn to balance better.

"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2021 11 December,"
The bike is exactly what I expected and seems to be pretty good quality. The only annoying issue is that the Allen wrench and socket to tighten the seat seems almost stripped and is very hard to turn without it popping out. It’s not worth the hassle of returning but is definitely annoying!

"
DFranck,4.0,2020 7 May,"
Really cute.  It assembled in minutes.  Good quality and perfect size for my tall 1 year old.  Only issue I found is that it does tip over easily if he’s not balancing properly.  I know it’s a balance bike and so therefore he needs to be balancing while using it but he’s still learning and so we had to be right there helping him for a while until he finally got it. Not a big deal. I still highly recommend this little bike
"
M.F.,5.0,2021 17 March,"
My nephew turned 1 and this has become his ultimate favorite toy. It was so simple to put together. Didn’t even need the instructions. There isn’t any annoying sound makers on it so the parents will thank you. My nephew even determined that the handle bars are perfect for teething babies... I have officially leveled up to best auntie ever status. Highly suggest this to all aunties/uncles, parents, and grandparents. You will not regret it.

OptimusPrime,5.0,2020 14 June,"
I somehow stumbled over this balance bike for my 14mths old. I am glad I did stick with the 2 front and 1 back wheel instead of 2 back wheels. Impressed with the quality of the bike.- Well designed. Well made.- Well constructed. Pretty sturdy.- Installation takes hardly 5mins. Easy install.- Amazing looking bike. Color choice is just awesome. It's a good looking bike. Loving my baby's Orange color. It's like the Orange cream color.- Rides smoothly.So far no cons. Good quality, seems durable and sturdy. Worth recommending and a good gift option.
"

The Toddler Bike is cute but it had practicality problem! Unfortunately, the handlebars cannot turn when the Toddler Bike was installed, I must ask to make exchange. If it still has same problem, I must ask return.
"
Vaughna Schooler,4.0,2021 5 January,"
My daughter loves this! We purchased it for her 2nd birthday and she can scoot around on it really well. I do wish the handle bars could go up higher though because she is on the small side as is and the bars are very low.
"
Nathan,5.0,2021 3 March,"
Bought for my 2 year old to scoot around the house with. He is shorter than average so it still works well for him. It is taller than some of the other balance bikes.  He enjoys it, and I like that the seat is adjustable. My 4 year old even tries to take a spin on it every so often, and it holds up to her too.

"
snowflake2312,3.0,2021 7 September,"
The only bike my 18 month old loved was the Chilafish green and white one (which my husband ran over with his truck on accident)…. This one and the other ones here are harder to turn for her because the handle bar and front wheels are larger so she won’t have fun on this until she’s 2

M,5.0,2020 29 October,"
This came assembled. Perfect bike for a 1 year old. She could handle the bike so easily even if they can’t walk yet. She felt like she could keep up with her older brother by riding bikes with him. I love this concept of no pedals. The kids love it! Bike is made well. We were extremely happy with this purchase, would buy it again. It’s a great gift, hit of the party!
"
Archis A,5.0,2021 23 January,"
This bike is good for a toddler and is relatively stable. Ours is for a 15 month old who is around 30 inches tall. He did not like it when younger so maybe that is something to consider. Our only gripe was that the handle bar is not height adjustable so it might get awkward once you start changing the height of the seat.
"
Vernell Carr,4.0,2021 12 July,"
love it
"
Helen,4.0,2021 11 January,"
It would of been easy to assemble but it was bent from shipping. We got it fixed enough to put together. My almost 2 year old would rather carry it around than ride it. :)
"
Lacey Blake,4.0,2020 28 June,"
Only gave 4 stars because the seat adjusts but the handlebars do not. As my toddler keeps growing, I can move the seat up but she has to hunch over to use the handlebars. Everything else is great but we would get so much more use from adjustable handle bars.
"
ARH,3.0,2020 5 May,"
So I have an obsession with yellow which my 1yo daughter has also picked up. So we were very excited for this. However she was slow to get into using this until her 2yo friend used his while she visited. Then she used it a few times always under a minute... I kept it outside in our covered patio area always.I noticed that the handle bars were grossly eroded and there was rust around all screws. This is unacceptable to me having only bought it a little Over a month ago and She barely noticed it until a couple weeks ago.So I’m returning it. I didn’t reach out to the seller first which i normally do so no clue if they're receptive or helpful.
"
A Martin,4.0,2019 13 November,"
We got this for our son on his first birthday. It was quick assembly unfortunately he is still a little short at 1 yo to maneuver it since his legs barely touch. With the two wheels in front they have to be able to use their legs more to keep them from falling over. He will grow into it and get better once he is a more stable walker I’m sure
"
rachel,5.0,2020 6 December,"
This light weight bike was easy to assemble. It’s sturdy and hasn’t caused any issues yet. It rolls well and came with the parts to adjust the height so she can use it as she grows. She just walks with it right now but it’s a good introductory at least to bike riding and gives a new activity to do

"
Marisa Toepfer,5.0,2021 25 January,"
Balance bike for my one year old. She is a little short for it. She has to be in her tippy toes but can easily push it forward! She will be able to use it for awhile especially since it has an adjustable seat.Great purchase, would definitely recommend to other parents!
"
Jaimie,3.0,2021 26 September,"
Good quality but a little difficult for our almost two year old to ride. It only has one back wheel so I feel like it tips over pretty easily.
"
 Angel,5.0,2021 29 March,"
My daughter started at 10 months. She loves it! She can't walk or crawl yet but she sure knows how to ride this bike!Please be careful and don't let your child ride unsupervised. They can fall and get injured in a split second!

Easy assembly, helps prepare toddler for balancing a big bicycle
"
joey,4.0,2019 9 November,"
I bought this for my little girl on her 1st birthday. A little young maybe but I wanted to introduce it early so she’d be comfortable on two wheels sooner than later. She hasn’t totally gotten the hang of it but shows interest. It seems to be durable and it light weight which makes packing it around great. Highly recommend.
"
Josh,3.0,2021 8 July,"
Very easy to put together, however it’s not very sturdy. The back wheel makes the bike tip over easily. If I were to buy this type of bike again I would definitely purchase one with a double back wheel and front wheel so that’s it’s more sturdy.

eric martinez,5.0,2020 20 May,"
My one yr old is kinda short but he very much wants to keep up with his sister and wants to ride a bike too. The first week he kept falling and I was even thinking about returning it but now he’s able to balance and he’s riding around everywhere on it! Definitely recommend this bike but make sure to give the littles ones time to adjust.
"
Bonnie VanDeVusse,4.0,2021 27 February,"
Solid, quality balance bike.  Made for little ones but tips easily with the 3 wheels.
"
Josue Rendon,4.0,2020 27 October,"
The bike is pretty, looks great. However, isn’t so much stable. On the other hand, the height of the sit isn’t so much ajustable, only a little bit.
"
Carolyn,4.0,2021 6 January,"
Daughter has balance issues and this helps her and she’s having fun too. Sturdy and not too heavy for her.

 For a 12 month old, she was a bit timid, but after a few days she loves it.  Her feet barely touches the ground, so we have to be with her 100% of the time, but we can imagine how much fun she will have once she is a bit older. Good quality bike for a toddler.

Georgia P. Yost,5.0,2021 1 August,"

"
Andrea,4.0,2019 22 July,"
My 1 year old can navigate this bike fairly well. She is slightly smaller than an average one year old, so she is still on top toes but it doesn't stop her from scooting around quickly. The handlebar doesn't allow for too sharp of turns (thank goodness for those of us whose toddlers have no fear). Incredibly simple to assemble.
"
Bilman,2.0,2022 13 February,"
The assembly looks to be easy.  Need to fix the handlebar with the front wheel.  Unfortunately that one screw is missing in the box.  I know how the bike performs, if I figure out a way to get that screw and assemble the bike.
"
Novelette,5.0,2020 28 September,"
This was much sturdier than I thought it was going to be.  Well made and was very easy to put together.  I just wish the seat could go a little lower. The wheels are very quite on all surfaces. I would buy again.
"
Mike  Chirveno,5.0,2021 4 September,"

"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2019 5 August,"
My granddaughter just started walking, about 2 weeks before her 1st birthday, she likes pushing it around, but cannot sit on it and balance just yet.  Seat needs to be adjustable.  But I like it, as easy assembly and wheels and seat are soft.
"
Sun Rae,5.0,2021 27 May,"
I bought this as a replacement & it’s great ! Excellent quality and my toddler loves it
"
Eliana,3.0,2020 20 August,"
Too good to be true, bought this for my nephew as a gift and feel embarrassed because I bragged about finding a great gift. Turns out my nephew or any of our kids can stay on it without waggling all over.DO  NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE. Go with the traditional car wagon instead.

"
Mallory,4.0,2019 29 July,"
Only disliked that the 1 year old I purchased this for was still too short for the lowest height we could set the bike at, which would've been unstable/unsafe should we still try to use it.

Shaun,3.0,2020 25 June,"
Very hard to keep my 1 year old balanced with this bike, even holding her up she feels as though she could tip to either side at any moment, at her birthday party when we brought it out some of the toddler kids tried to ride it and fell down themselves, guided use only

In general, it’s a good quality balance bike, but my daughter refused to ride on it. The problem was that that bicycle is short and you can not lift the seat up.

SaOlsen ,2.0,2021 12 September,"
This sweet little bike seemed perfect for our 1 yr old, however it has caused multiple falls/crashes because it is too easily tipped over by a 12 -14 month old. Also too small for a two and a half yr old.  Bad purchase.

"
CB,1.0,2022 1 June,"
It looked like it was going to be a great product but the screw to lower the seat was not aligned correctly so it could not be turned. I bought a second one and it had the same issue so I returned both of them.

I love this bike and so does my 18 month old.  She can easily scoot right along.  It does tip very easily but her balance is already improving.
"
Erin V. Gaetz,1.0,2022 11 April,"
Yikes. I had high hopes for this little bike, but the wheels were so wobbly — even after I tried to tighten the bolts — that there’s no way my 19-month-old can use it. The seat also doesn’t really adjust, and the wheels are super cheap plastic. Maybe I just got a particularly bad one off the assembly line, but oof.
"
Anacani Sanchez,5.0,2019 10 December,"
This is a very cute bike, my 1 1/2 year old loves it.  The only downside is that she has a hard time balancing herself but she manages it.

Lisa O'Brien,2.0,2021 17 March,"
This bike is really cute and my 1 year old granddaughter loved sitting on it. The reason for this poor review is it was poorly made. The screws were too short, and the whole for the main locking system on the handlebar portion was not in the right spot. My husband was very frustrated putting this item together
"
Jennifer,1.0,2022 14 May,"
Was excited with this bike until I went to put it together, good thing I did, as it was a gift. Handle bars would not fit all the way into the frame. Disappointed and returned for a refund.

Easy to assemble but the dimensions are very odd. I would recommend going with a different bike!! The seat is adjustable (height) but the handle bar isn’t which makes no sense to me!!! If you adjust the seat higher because you have a taller or growing child then the handle bar still stays low and it’s super awkward!!
"
jay o.,2.0,2021 3 April,"
It’s cute and all however, it’s very hard for babies to keep balance and it’s quite dangerous when they do fall to the side. Wish they could of put some sort of training wheels for stability. Don’t recommend this product, I don’t feel secure when my daughter gets on it.
"
SYNODA,1.0,2021 6 March,"
The toy Came used missing screw and screw key everything was just thrown in  the box . The instructions manual had been opened and folded and had a finger stain on it paid for new product and  received  a used one .usually not  a big deal to me i just clean it off instead on going through return hassle , this is a baby product and the times were in with corona i was just disgusted when i touched that manual everyone might not have this  experience and i can tell the bike is made of good material but i cant let my baby play with this after that

 Huge disappointment for my granddaughter
"
Laura,1.0,2020 22 September,"
I bought this online for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday.  She is a normal size 2 year old, but his bike was way too small for her.  The handlebar does not adjust at all even though the seat does.  For the price, I was expecting something much nicer.  I have already packed it up to return it.  I would not recommend buying this bike.
"
Elena DeCristino,1.0,2021 22 April,"
It was way smaller and super unsteady! Definitely not for a 1 year old or any child for that matter. The handle bar was so low it was almost impossible to really teach the little one to sit on it. I had to send it back.
"
Dan J,1.0,2020 15 May,"
We purchased the blue option and when it arrived the box looked like it was a returned item as the box was sealed in a way that looked rushed. Upon inspecting the parts we noticed some scrapes and areas where there were signs of use. The item page did not state that the option was refurbished so it was a bit of a let down to find these Knicks and bruises on the item.
"
Edwin Quinones,1.0,2021 25 July,"
I purchased this for my 18 months old niece, she looked at it, and picked up like a toy and carried it away. Even with the sit adjusted it did nothing for her.
"
PATTI BRADY,1.0,2021 5 May,"
Not for toddlers as advertised. Way too small for a 18 month old. Seat height does not adjust. I’m hoping it can be returned even if it has been assembled and used once outside.
"

birthday gift for my granddaughter
"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2021 18 April,"
Cute and appears to be sturdy. Should have been snap to assemble BUT - hole in fork and wheels do not line up! Poor quality control, has to go back!
"
IS,1.0,2021 10 September,"
It was too small for my 2 Yeats old niece and you cant adjust the height to fit
"
Yohanny cabrera,1.0,2021 5 December,"
It’s too little
"
kelly fisher,1.0,2021 9 June,"
The holw in the handlebars does not line up with the hole in the frame so we can't attach them properly! Boo!
"
christina,1.0,2020 31 March,"
I bought this for my 2 year old who is average in size and it's so small she cant even move on it. The handle bars are so short and so close to the seat it's impossible for her to ride. Such a disappointment!
"
Gina ,3.0,2022 17 September,"
Received ahead of a birthday party. Was excited to get, as I’ve already purchased this in the past and loved it. But this time, the box came clearly retaped and dented - it was obviously returned. I don’t feel comfortable gifting this…. And don’t have time to repurchase. Will return.
"
Theresa,1.0,2021 16 February,"
The holes didn’t line up and when we finally got the screws in, they popped out within a week. Not worth the money!
"
Chelsy Shore,1.0,2021 29 March,"
This is the second bike we have gotten. Both of them have broken at the front wheel axel.
"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2020 8 June,"
Very disappointing.  Don’t know why it’s called balance bike. Easily tips over. Not suitable at all for a early age walker. The three year old didn’t keep it upright either.  A pricey purchase.

 It’s a nice idea so the little ones can have a little bike like their siblings!
"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2020 7 August,"
Entirely too small for any toddler that can walk. Poorly designed, handles are too low for a child to maneuver. Front wheels are too close together it doesn’t prevent kids from tipping over.
"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2021 26 May,"
Didn't last 2 weeks, rear wheel kept falling off.
"

"
Harley,1.0,2021 25 March,"
Pieces was put on correct and the handle bar still doesn’t line up right
"
Rob,1.0,2020 6 December,"
This is NOT a safe product. As soon as the front wheel is turned in any direction the whole trike tips over.
"
Lisa L.,1.0,2020 25 February,"
I was so disappointed when I received this item. It was so small and looked like a cheap gift, that I returned it immediately. The seat appeared larger than the bike.
"
Dennis,1.0,2019 30 October,"
Returned this trike for a more sturdy because it tips over constantly and is dangerous. Only has one wheel in the back that contributes to this.
"
Shyniece McGennis,1.0,2020 11 February,"
The bike was not sturdy. My daughter didn’t even ride it for 5 minutes before falling off. I returned it.

Our LO only steps out the house on her balance bike, she's. 1.5yrs  rides it fast even maintaining balance while speeding through turns, has really helped with her development and confidence building. A minor malfuntion happened to the rear wheel, allobebe sent us a whole new balance bike the next day, customer service could not be better! 5 stars for the bike AND customer service.

Aec,1.0,2022 21 March,"
After reading the reviews we got this bike - it has great reviews! But my daughter is constantly tipping this thing over and falling! It’s not sturdy/stable at all. It doesn’t turn very well either. Definitely not what I was expecting based on all the good reviews.
"
Katrina Mooney,5.0,2021 28 April,"
Bought this for my granddaughter,  she absolutely loves it
"
KT - Six Eight Tall,1.0,2022 2 March,"
Was excited to receive as a gift from a relative whose kids loved this toy however the plastic molding does not allow the center handlebar to fit fully into the front wheel support which causes a huge safety hazard to my toddler. Customer support hasn’t responded to help address this situation. Please be careful that the parts fully connect before using and good luck seeing support if there is a problem.
"
Samantha Johnson,5.0,2021 27 February,"
My niece loved it for you birthday gift.
"
Dominique j,3.0,2021 14 May,"
I’m very confused with all the positive reviews. I received this bike as a gift so I can’t return. My child constantly falls off and gets hurt as soon as she turns the wheel. Not sturdy at all. Definitely needs two wheels on the back. It looks cute but not functional at all.
"
Elizabeth,1.0,2022 10 January,"
My daughter loves this bike so much. It was outside on the patio for a few months and the grips were destroyed. So we just bought some new grips to match a few weeks ago to replace them. But now the forks just broke and she’s so sad. There’s no fixing it. I didn’t expect it to make it through multiple kids, but also didn’t expect it to break after 6 months either and am really disappointed.Buyer beware that this won’t last.If the seller will please contact me and send me a new piece to replace the broken one (seems like just the fork piece) I would really appreciate it and I’ll update my review with the details.

I ordered them late and was surprised that they were still scheduled to arrive on the day of his birthday. Well they did not. They showed up a day early!!!! My daughter is thrilled with the training bike and all the new books to read to him while they stay home. Everyone's happy!!!!

Carrollable,3.0,2021 12 January,"
I won't describe how difficult it was to get this together only to realize it's too small. My Granddaughter is just over a year old. She is too big for it. The toddler on the front of the box is too big for it.  The parts don't fit together very well. I'm so upset that I put all the time, money and effort into this to end up not giving it to her. My son in law took one look and agreed that it was way too small. It's cute, but just too small for a toddler. Disappointed Grandma

"
Applesandpaint,1.0,2021 5 July,"
This balance bike was incredibly easy to put together and had all the required tools in the box. BUT the bike is really really small. I don’t know how the age range is up to 36 months. It is way too small for my 18 month old and she could not ride it.
"

"
Andrew,1.0,2020 14 July,"
This product was defective.  On the one I received, the collar on the handlebars was not properly aligned, making the entire front end unstable.  I removed the screws to see if it could be adjusted, but no luck (unless I wanted to drill and tap new holes).  I’m returning it.

Got this for my daughter for her 1st bday and the handle bars seem to not be sturdy at all, not sure if I got some defective or it’s just adult proof assembly. I screwed the handle bars into the front wheel like the instructions said and the handle bars rock back and forth not sturdy at all.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 10 September,"
So far we really like this little bike. We bought this for my daughter for her first birthday. She hasn't started walking yet, so her balance isn't the greatest, but she can stay on this bike pretty well by herself. She can't get into it herself yet, but when we put her on she has a great time pushing herself around the living room. I anticipate lots of use when she gets big enough to use it all by herself.
"
Kimlee,4.0,2021 20 September,"

We love this bike for our little grand niece--who we spoil a lot and still hope she grows up to make a positive difference in this world, even if she's spoiled rotten by us. She was thrilled on her 1st birthday because her older brothers both have their own bikes. Now she gets to ride hers too. It doesn't have any foot stirrups. She's just going to think she's riding while she walks along and steers the direction of the bike. It's helping her keep her balance while walking.
"

Becca,5.0,2021 15 December,"
I bought this for my granddaughter‘s first birthday. She really likes it, but she is pretty short. The seat does not move up or down, so there’s no adjustability to this. However, we would push her around on it even though her toes couldn’t touch the floor.

My daughter loves this bike. It is sturdy and seems less like a balance bike. She is 2, and she prefers this to the 2 wheel bikes. She is gaining a lot of confidence with this bike so much so that she is starting to feel more comfortable on the 2 wheeled bike.
"
Melissa Yunke,5.0,2021 19 April,"
This balance bike was an upgrade from another balance bike with wider tires for my 19 month old. She took to it immediately and uses it multiple times a day. It’s light enough that she can pick it up and carry it but also sturdy enough that this mama feels safe with her riding it. It really does feel more like a real bike than most of the balance bikes out there... we’ve tried a few. The metal frame and materials used for the handlebar grips and seat feel like they’re of good quality. With it’s adjustable seat, we should get a good deal of use out of it. We got ours for $37 as an open box, definitely worth checking out what they have available under the “new & used” section! Would recommend to others and plan on purchasing as a gift for friends that have kiddos of a similar age.

"
Danilo C.,3.0,2021 4 January,"
I’ve bought this bicycle for my son, but I had to return as it was too small for him, on the description and on the box it says it is recommended for children between 1 and 3 years old and my son is 15 months so we thought would be perfect for him. This bicycle is too small for him, if it wasn’t that I would have kept, has good quality.
"
PrettyPicky,5.0,2021 25 July,"
Wish these would have been around for my children. Can remember them always catching their little ankles on the back wheels, when they'd push themselves around. Overall better than expected. Easy to put together, durable material and stable. The grandbaby will get plenty of miles on it in no time lol
"
Laul,1.0,2021 1 June,"
Be careful! This isn't made well as part of the wheel came apart and i didn't know until I found my child with a screw in her mouth! The screw cap and screw came out of the wheel which is super dangerous! Please be very cautious if you have this bike! Not worth the worry in my opinion. It's worth spending more on a properly made bike than one that endangers a child's life.
"
jaymes loney,2.0,2020 23 October,"
I strongly dislike this product. The back wheel isn’t very sturdy so it constantly tips over. It’s not safe for the age group it’s marketed for. It’s super cute but not practical.

We have 2 Grandsons. The 14 month old got the 3 wheeler, while the 3 yr old got the 2 wheel version. Both enjoy them thoroughly.

We assembled this bike as per the instructions but the parts barely fit together and as a result the bike can barely steer. It's very hard to turn the handlebars. Our toddler cannot turn them to steer.  Would not recommend this product.

Natalia D'Angelo,5.0,2022 25 October,"
This ninja blender is great. Very easy to assemble and disassemble. it is safe if you have kids that like to help in the kitchen because it only turns it own if every piece is in place and the lid is locked, so you can press the buttons but nothing will happen unless it is locked. It has 3 speeds, but number 1 of good enough to blend frozen things. I love it!
"
Wyatt Agnew,5.0,2022 5 November,"
Struggled through our old blender for years because it “still worked” and we got it for free when we got married. I wish we would have upgraded years ago! Love everything about it
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2022 21 September,"
We upgraded from an old basic Oster to this model. The Oster seemed to be dying.Overall it’s nice, it just doesn’t always blend all larger chunks, especially frozen fruit. Maybe there’s a trick to how to load it, or to phase load the blender for smoothies. I’ve heard great things about Ninja products, and we also just bought an air fryer. This one has been a little disappointing.My other least favorite thing is it’s trickier to clean. There are many crevices things seem to rest and get stuck. So that’s slightly annoying.I love the capacity for a family of four. I love the lid design. I love how the blade comes out, and the bottom doesn’t have to come off. That way it’s always aligned and it locks easily on to the motor base.It’s nice, but could use some design improvements I guess.
"
Madeline Vega,5.0,2022 1 November,"

You get what you pay for and you will.not find a better blender at this price point. This blender is just as good as my $300 VitamiX!! Do yourself a favor, don't buy cheap Walmart blenders. Get yourself a Ninja, you'll be glad you did!

Herbert Otto Homolka,5.0,2022 25 October,"

"
Alexis Reel,5.0,2022 16 September,"
I love this blender! I’ve made smoothies, sauces, and cocktails in it. It blends really well, and sometimes my smoothies come out to airy, but it still tastes good. The blade comes out easily to clean, but cleaning the blade entirely can be a little difficult and somewhat hard since the blade is really really sharp. The only drawback. I would highly recommend!!
"
Kari Crump,5.0,2022 25 September,"
Blends very well.  I was looking for a blender that worked well without having to put in a lot of liquid.  This blender works well with limited liquid and doesn't leave chunks.
"
Sue Brown,5.0,2022 6 September,"
So happy with this blender! I can’t believe we waited so long to buy a blender; we’re now using this almost daily. The blender is super easy to use and very powerful. My only complaint is that it can be hard to clean down in the crevices of the blade and base if you don’t clean it out right away. But that’s my own fault! Would definitely recommend!
"
T.K.,4.0,2022 5 October,"
Great power, good for smoothies, but too big for small tasks like a cup of hollandaise.

"
M&M,5.0,2022 7 September,"
I went through THREE blenders before going with Ninja!  Has lasted for longer than three months and the ease of use and cleaning is a plus!  The only issue is I wish this model came with personal blender capability but otherwise would definitely recommend this blender.
"
kmk,5.0,2022 24 July,"
Pros:Easy to use—only three parts, guidelines on base help you see how to put the container on. Three easy buttons. Does not require tamping the food into the blade.Base is sleek and solid.Blades are VERY sharp. Be careful.Easy to clean. The blade comes out and rinses clean. The container is wide enough to reach into with a cloth. Beats the pricier Vitamix by a mile on cleaning ease.POWER— it ate up chunks of frozen fruit with no problems.Price—great price for the functionality.ConsIt’s large. Requires a lot of room on counter or in cabinet. Does not fit under kitchen top cabinets.Blades are dangerously sharp.It blends a lot of air into smoothies. They end up a bit foamy. I haven’t had it long, so there may be ways to avoid this.If you need a blender primarily for smoothies or frozen cocktails, you can’t go wrong here!
"
Kagrange,5.0,2022 26 September,"

"Catina Ryan,",5.0,2022 5 September,"
After my Breville died I needed another blender, but didn’t want to spend a lot as I’m saving for a Blendtec or vitamix. This is surprisingly good. It gets used at least twice a day for smoothies and does a great job. It handles ice and frozen berries like a champ.

It’s nice compact size doesn’t take a lot of counter space.
"
Bea,5.0,2022 22 August,"
I had an old Ninja and this is a huge step up. A great machine and so much more powerful. It is much easier to clean than the old one because for some reason there was an opening at the bottom of the old one that allowed whatever was being blended to get into a little opening in the base and it was very hard to clean. I highly recommend this one!
"
Fat Boy,5.0,2022 15 August,"
This is the best blender I've ever had.  We use it mostly for fruit smoothies and it blends very well.  But one time I accidentally left a spoon in the blender, put the top in and started to blend.  I had added ice so figured the loud sound was the ice.  Instead, the spoon I had overlooked quickly blew a hole in the side of the container, and could have caused serious injuries had someone shorter than my 5'4"" been the user.  We got a replacement container and have been happily blending ever since.
"

"
david kwok,4.0,2022 30 July,"
As a person that worked at a smoothie shop I could tell you that the smoothies that I have made with this blender, have the same results as the vitamin x blender that I used to work with. if you use all frozen fruits it will take a little more to blend but when using a combination of fresh and frozen is very quick and easy!My only complain is that it’s a little bit hard to wash but everything else is fine!

Phil in Phoenix,4.0,2022 12 August,"
I’ve purchased much more expensive blender and this is far superior as far as power, ease of use and easy to pop into the dishwasher. I use my blender a lot for hummus that is thick and hard on a blender, this does it with ease. Glad I believed the reviews I read on Amazon
"
Kaitlyn W,4.0,2022 8 August,"
We already have a Ninja blender and bought this for a vacation home. It is a more basic model than the blender we have at home. Wish all the models had more functions. With that said, it does the job and they are more powerful than other blenders we've used. Ninja is definitely my favorite for the power.

 The container measurement is off as to it being 72oz, I received a 64oz, just a bit deceiving. But, besides the container measurement difference, it's a pretty good blender. It did give a funny slite burning smell the first time I used it. It gets the job done
"
Erin B Gibb,5.0,2022 6 September,"
The ability to make crushed ice drinks, that are blended to perfection, with the right amount of juice and alcohol, was perfect.
"
S.C.,4.0,2022 18 May,"
So far, I’ve only used this once. I’ve turned it on to clean it a couple of times, though. It did a good job of blending everything. All the frozen strawberries were blended. Almost all of the frozen bananas were as well. It left one tiny piece of banana, but to be fair, my nutribullet does the same thing sometimes. I’ll post an update if I have any other issues with it in the near future. The only complaint I have today is the fact that it does not come with the same cup in the picture. It says 72oz, but it’s really 64oz. It’s not the worst thing ever, but it’s deceiving.  If you look through the pictures, there’s an * with an explanation of it only being able to hold 64oz. Mine doesn’t even say 72oz on the cup. It says 64oz.
"
Lana,5.0,2022 19 September,"
Love it. Blends wonderfully
"
Chelsey,4.0,2022 18 July,"
I love this blender, EXCEPT that it won’t blend chia seeds into my smoothie. They just get spun around and stay whole. It crushes ice, blends veggies and fruits, but just not the chia seeds. Maybe I’m using it wrong? My old Oster blender would pulverize the chia seeds, but it lacked the power to crush ice and frozen fruits well, so this turned out to be the complete opposite of my old one!
"
Ernie,5.0,2022 26 August,"
Get this blender, easy to clean, does what it’s suppose to do. Basically upgrade from a blender that’s been in the family for over 2 decades.
"
Kathey Fatica,5.0,2022 23 July,"
I have had the same Ninja 1000W model for probably 12 years and it's a work horse. But it’s old and I have to hold the lid down in one corner to get the motor to engage. It was time to replace it. I looked at replacing it with models with more bells and whistles and figured why pay extra for features that I already have on my food processor which works just fine. So I gladly chose the same Ninja model I've used for many years... and hope it lasts another 12!

Haven't used this blender all that often yet, but everything I've made in it has come out great.  I've made fruit smoothies, milk drinks, and potato pancakes so far.  I'm sure I'll be using it for more things because it is easier to clean than my food processor.

"
Juan Diaz de Lindo,5.0,2022 18 July,"
Ninja is a well known brand and it seems for good reason. This is one of their entry level models and despite this and it's low price, it is more than capable of doing what most folks require of it.There's a lemonade I make that requires I blend the entire lemon with rind and all and this thing sliced and diced half a dozen of them easily. Same thing with the ice added later.Just be careful when cleaning as those blades are SHARP. I speak from lacerated experience.
"
Sandra,5.0,2022 21 July,"
I wanted a blender so I could make smoothies. I ordered this Ninja blender during Prime Days. I love its power. The center blades are not just on bottom but also at middle and top so blending is complete. Lid locks on so no chance of it popping off, and there’s a corner of the lid that has an opening topour contents without removing lid. On scale of 1 - 10, this blender is a definite 10.

"
Soy La,4.0,2022 1 April,"
The blender works great so far but the first few uses it let off a smoky smell as if it was being overused and about to go out. I’m not sure why since I use more than enough liquid and I’ve only used fruits such as banana, mangoes and strawberries. I’m wondering how long this will actually work before it clocks out due to this . But as I said so far it’s blended with great power , so I have hope . Also the last two times, I didn’t notice the smell so maybe it was just a “breaking it in “ smell.Oh and I also didn’t like the fact that the blade doesn’t snap in. It just sits in there , which is fine overall, it was just off putting at first.
"
Dave Staats,5.0,2022 18 July,"
Wow! That already had an Osterizer Classic top of the line blender but it wasn't handy for making big or double smoothies. This thing with the ""blade tree"" is fantastic. The canister goes on and off easily ad does the lid. It only costs as much as 10 smoothies. 8 oz frozen fruit and 8 oz OJ makes a great smoothie in less than a minute. Great machine! I also love their cookware.

This blender is awesome! It’s easy to clean ! A warning about the blades, they are sharp! This thing could shred a tree trunk if it fit in there I think. If you’re looking for a powerful blender that’s a breeze to clean, get the ninja!
"
Amy,3.0,2022 12 October,"
I just got this item yesterday looks pretty new but little skeptical. I saw a small round glue like thing and touched it got smudged and was oily as seen on pic. Ninja tag was off.  Looks like it has been repaired. Not sure. Hopefully its not a refurbished product. Haven’t used it yet. Got this item earlier than needed. Will definitely be reviewing it later again.
"
Chipman,5.0,2022 22 August,"
Just be aware that the blades on this thing are not like typical blender blades. They are tiny samurai swords and they will cut you to ribbons if you are not careful. Treat the ninja with respect.

Brenda Harmon,5.0,2022 16 July,"

I was previously using an old blender to make smoothies until it died. It was the traditional four blades on the bottom and was quite noisy. I tried my new Ninja and the six blades that rotate throughout the picture make mixing far less noisy and efficient. The only thing I would advise is to use caution when cleaning the blades.

Anakronism,3.0,2022 15 August,"
I bought this blender for multiple daily use before and after gastric bypass surgery. I really loved it at first despite it being loud. It completely pulverized ice and made the smoothest shakes. However after only one month of use the blades have tiny little dings in them and the texture of my protein shakes has become crunchy from small chunks of ice that no longer blend to a smooth consistency. It's a good little blender but if you're planning on using it daily for things with ice in it, I wouldn't recommend it.

Amylou,5.0,2022 24 May,"
It has a safety feature that prevents you from blending without the lid. The triple blades makes slushies and smoothies quick and easy.
"
JenDiggity,2.0,2022 25 August,"
It doesn’t blend things entirely smooth even when you blend then let it sit for like half an hour in between three blend sessions to try and make sure everything is getting soft and absorbing fluid. Like BREAD will not blend. Wet bread is too tough for it. The controls are lousy (why no timed blend???). The blades are annoying to clean and don’t try and pour anything out with the blades still in because it’ll fall right out. I needed this for my son’s puréed food and it is wholly inadequate. And somehow I ordered TWO then proceeded to get Covid and be so sick I missed the return window so now I have two TERRIBLE blenders. What a waste of money. I’d buy the Instant Pot Ace blender again if they didn’t stop making it because of constant bearing issues. At least it could blend smoothly! I shouldn’t have to pay $400 for a decent blender! You manufacturers need to step up your game.

I received this blender on 5/20/2022 and it wouldn't blend my smoothie today (5/23/2022) regardless of how much liquid I put in.  I turned it on after taking all the ingredients out of the carafe and the blades spun perfectly.  I put just a small amount back in and they would barely turn.  I put more in with some MORE liquid and the blades wouldn't move at all.I'm returning it and looking for a different blender because there is no way I'm wasting $70 on something that works like this.
"
ET,2.0,2022 20 July,"
The blades are very dangerous..they go up so high I cut myself badly during first use. The blender itself did not puree ice like I thought it would in my smoothie it left big pieces so I had to return it unfortunately it just did not have the blending power I needed.

Blender seems very good the two times I’ve used it. Somehow already chipped the plastic bottom pretty significantly though with cracks extending pretty far. Not that sturdy on the plastic so protection plan may actually be worth it.
"
MossRose,1.0,2022 13 October,"
I never was able to use this blender because one leg on the base is crooked and shorter than the rest, meaning the blender rocks quite a bit. I was afraid to turn it on with only 3 legs touching the countertop.  Imagine the destruction! I am returning this blender (Thank you, Amazon, for making this a simple process!) and looking for a non-Ninja blender, since Ninja's quality control is less than dependable.

It has great power and works awesome! Blenderizes like I've never seen before. Unfortunately after 2 uses the bottom of the blender container itself cracked so now it leaks. Really disappointed about this. Having spent almost $100 I expected better quality.
"
Anne,1.0,2022 23 August,"
I loved the single-serve Ninja I’ve had for years, and recently bought this one because I figured I could use it for smoothies as well as cooking. Nope. So far I’ve only tried smoothies, and they come out a disgusting, gritty, grainy texture. I’m used to the Ninja single-serve blenders that do a great job of mixing everything up. This one will not give you the same result—expect ingredients to stick to the sides since it’s a square shape.
"
Molly B,1.0,2022 30 October,"

Everytime i have used this blender it leaves everything it blends completely filled with bubbles. So much that it ruins whatever you’re making, would return it but my window closed and now I’m stuck with it
"
Ulua.kayak,1.0,2022 30 July,"
After two uses, the plastic on the Jat turn really foggy. Looks like from mixing ice and frozen fruits. Yes, I add ebough liquids, but it turns like the pictures shown. I have to return it, because I don't want to eat plastic with my Smooties. Other than that, no complain for everything else. I wish it has a better plastic quality.
"
Michael Statchen,1.0,2022 11 October,"

yvonne medina,1.0,2022 17 July,"
The description on the website saids it’s a 72oz pitcher and I received a 64oz pitcher, I didn’t realize until I used it and had already threw the box away , I don’t want a refund I just want the correct pitcher but the only options on the website it’s to return item, otherwise the blender works great.
"
Montessahall,1.0,2022 14 August,"
The power is definitely there however, when blending for smoothness it misses the mark. The dates in my banana smoothies are left chunky rather than blended. The blades are sharp which requires care when cleaning to avoid cuts to hand or fingers. Horrible blender for anything you want blended smooth
"
Ashley Russell,1.0,2022 26 April,"
Do not buy this it’s horrible it makes noise and smoke to the very first time we used it. I tried to return it to Amazon but they would not take it because our return window had closed. We keep it in our second home so we didn’t have a chance to use it before a return window closed. This company does not stand behind its products!!!
"
Steven Knoll,1.0,2022 5 September,"
The plastic top is already broken after only about 4 times of using it. Would not buy again plus all the ingredients stick to the side and don’t get mixed in.

Two weeks after the return window had closed (so we’ve had it for only 6 weeks) it developed a long crack on the container which causes it to leak.

This Ninja NJ601AMZ Professional Blender is a large and powerful Blender.  It has a 1000 watt motor and a large capacity Pitcher.  The pitcher has a 64oz max liquid capacity.  The pitcher is plastic and is lightweight but feels pretty durable.  It blends really well, sometimes too well.  My son likes to makes smoothies and this blends them up quickly and really well too.  The blades can be removed to clean, but beware they are sharp, have to be careful when they are in the dishwasher.  This Ninja blender definitely packs a punch and blends really well.

Mad Max,4.0,2021 23 December,"
This is a great blender for the price. After testing several top brands here are my notes:Keep in mind this Ninja is only 1,000 watts. For most people and most applications that's more than adequate, I'm not sure why people are so fixated on wattage instead of the more important aspects of a good blender. But just be aware, the high end brands do offer more wattage. Vitamix ranges from1100-1400, Blendtec offers 1500 and 1800 options, and the larger Ninja is 1500.The most consistently highest rated blender in the world is the Vitamix. They are workhorses, last forever, and crush anything. The second highest rated blender is Blendtec, for the same reasons. And I agree, they are the best built with superior motors.However, I will say the Ninja beats them on versatility. Also keep in mind you can add the Ninja food processor attachment to this (it doesn't come with one, but our old one fits it just fine).Having said all of that, my personal favorite is the Dash Chef Series Deluxe 64 oz Blender. It does not have attachments like the Ninja, but I find it to be extremely versatile, 1400 watt motor, and the easiest to use with the most settings. It has presets for smoothies, chopping ice, soups, ice cream, nut butter, a self-cleaning option, and it will even charge your phone or tablet. It has a built-in tablet stand (for when you're cooking), and it was the quietest of all the blenders I tested.The sticker price on the Dash is $229, so more than twice as much as this basic Ninja. If I have just $100 to spend, I would get this Ninja (or wait for the Ninja blender/food processor to go on sale). If I had $200 to spend, I would save up and get the Dash.One final note - on modern blenders, the motor isn't usually the first thing to fail. The digital buttons and dials are usually the first thing to fail. That's another reason the Vitamix is so well rated, because the electronics are simpler, it uses old fashioned knobs that don't fail. Still, though, I prefer the Dash.
"
Julie,5.0,2022 7 June,"
This blender works as well as the Vitamix we own. It may mix a little better and faster even with the blade placement throughout. Personally, I prefer the blades at the bottom because I like to use a spatula to scrape out all of the smoothie, and there isn't room for a spatula between the blades and the sides of this mixer. But that's the only drawback I've found. Otherwise, this blender works great -- definitely upgrade from the typical blender.
"
Christie W.,4.0,2022 14 January,"
This blender is powerful. I can't say if it does the job better than my cheaper blender, though. It does seem a little quieter. And the pitcher holds 72 oz whereas my other blender holds 48oz. I'm not comfortable with using it with anything hot since it is a plastic pitcher... The blade only seems securely in place when the lid is on, when I poured out my drink the blade came too.
"
Yashahime,4.0,2022 5 January,"
I do gotta admit that the blades of this blender are razor sharp be careful and weary when you are cleaning and using this blender. At first sight this blender is pretty standard in size and really packs a punch.This blender has a standard open cap or a halfway open cap depending on how you want to use it. The blender has a twist and lock style so the actual blender does not shake off the machine. The machine is really powerful and is able to blend frozen fruits into a smoothly easily. It's also super easy to disassemble and also clean, you can put some detergent along with hot water and run the blender.If you are looking for something that packs a punch and works flawlessly this is a great option.
"
Jeffrey Van Wagoner,5.0,2022 10 February,"
We have had this blender for a couple of months and have made many smoothies, hummus, and puréed soup. Other reviewers have mentioned that the container has cracked, but so far, ours has held strong. I will update this review if that changes. I love that this blender is simple to use as there are only four buttons. It is a nice-looking blender and feels very sturdy. It came well packaged and in excellent condition. The smoothies are delicious and nice and smooth if you let it run for long enough- otherwise, there may be ice chunks. The square shape helps with the contents blending instead of just spinning like they sometimes do in a round blender. The lid is a little tricky, and my kids struggle with it when they are helping, as there is only one way you can put it on, and the handle has to be up and then locked down. It is nice that it locks. The pour spout is also good and is much less drippy than our last blender, so we don't end up with smoothies all over the table. My favorite feature about this blender is that it is easy to clean. There is no need to unscrew things - take the blade out, and you can easily hand wash the pitcher without slicing your fingers, or fill the whole thing with some soapy water, blend it on high, and rinse. The blade is a little scary to handle, as it is three blades that go all the way around. Overall we are pleased with this blender. I've always wanted a VitaMix, and although this blender is not quite as nice, it works great for us.

 Edit: I have been using this brander for close to a year now and I am really enjoying it now that I am used to it. I use it to blend my hot sauce and it does a pretty good job getting it really blended. If I quickly pulse it I can get it to coarsely chop my veggies too. I am really glad I have this blender.So far this blender works well for me. It is definitely a bit loud. As all blenders are.. It also seems a bit… much- the big lid that has to go on a certain way, the button you have to push to release it, the pour spout hole, the ginormous blades.. please note-apparently the blades are not attached and you need to remove them before pouring. I made a smoothie that ended up being thicker than I meant for, so I couldn’t pour it through that little pour hole. The blades came shooting out and just missed my hand. Thank goodness, because those blades are sharp I know they would have done damage.This blender has a large capacity which is nice when I need it. I find myself reaching for my old blender because it just seems smaller and less bulky.I was very excited for this blender. This blender does work good, it blends as a blender should, nothing special to me though. It still misses occasional chunks when blending, just like my old blender. This one is more work to clean though.

"
Shala Kerrigan,5.0,2022 25 March,"
My family LOVES Ninja kitchen appliances, so let's get that out of the way first. It definitely affects reviews because just seeing the name inspires trust in my family full of pretty decent cooks and they put them through their paces.This is a nice blender, it has done well with everything we've thrown into it. While I do have a combination Ninja food processor/blender, this is the blender we use for smoothies, etc. It handles nuts and other things like a dream.
"
Ian D.,5.0,2022 19 January,"
This blender is fairly large (definitely full-sized, and not personal-sized), and it makes fast work of most things you might wish to blend. It doesn't have the same power as some of the most powerful blenders on the market, but it provides a good balance of blending power and economical price. If you start getting up to the 1500 watt power rating, you'll be spending at least $150 or more, depending on the brand you go for. With this, you get a great amount of power (1000 watts) from a very well-known brand, and it's just $100. Some of the benefits of this:1. The blending blades go up the middle of blender rather than just sitting at the bottom. You have extra blades, which means that it blends evenly top to bottom, without much chance of things getting stuck to the sides and not blending.2. It's large, but it looks pretty nice and professional, similar to what you might see in smoothie places.3. The power is enough to get through most anything. It crushes ice in smoothies, resulting in a very uniform result. It works to blend soups, sauces, purees, etc. I haven't found something it can't get through effectively and quickly.Overall, for the price, it's great. Unless you know you'll need to really blend some tough stuff, this should be enough for most home uses.
"
Two kids mom,4.0,2021 15 December,"
The best thing about these Ninja blenders is that the blades go all the way up the stem. These means they circulate the ingredients much better than a blender with just bottom blades and you spend less time scraping stuff back down to get it to blend.This one has enough power to really chop ice to the size you can use for drinks.You can only put 64 ounces in it, it needs room at the top.It is straightforward with just 3 buttons and a pulse button. That is really all you need. The fact that they are flat makes them easier to clean.I will say, look around. The prices on these Ninjas vary a lot, and you can get one with more power at the some price, with maybe a few less buttons. Some even come with the smoothie cups, which this one does not.  So think about what you want before buying and look at all the available models.I am taking a star because at the current 100 price this should come with some smoothie cups, a more powerful but older version of this comes with two and costs 10 bucks less.

This Ninja NJ601AMZ blender is powerful (1000 watts) and not too loud.  It's easy to use and also easy to clean; the pitcher is even dishwasher safe.  The only thing I don't like is that the pitcher is plastic.  I prefer the all-metal pitchers of vintage Vitamix blenders, but blenders these days don't seem to offer that.  It comes with a booklet of 10 recipes to get you started.

 I was intrigued and impresssed by this nice-appearing blender until I realized that the same basic blender is available in a higher-powered version with more features for $10 less than the price being charged for this model here on Amazon. You can find the better, less expensive, blender here: https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-BN701-Professional-capacity-Crushing/dp/B0855B5Z6F/.So I can see no real reason to recommend this blender at $99, despite the fact that it's a capable blender. But the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus Bender has 1400 watts of power to this blender's 1000 watts, and three programmed functions for making smoothies, frozen drinks and blending ice cream that this blender lacks. And it costs $89.If you get this blender, be careful of the blade. Like other Ninja blender blades, it's exceedingly sharp.Otherwise, this is a capable basic blender from Ninja.
"
Baazumi,5.0,2022 12 February,"
Powerful blender that handles ice really well and makes great smoothies.  It also purees vegetables and soups that come out nice and creamy.  The jar holds 72 ounce which is quite a lot and is easy to clean. A biton the noisy side as all blenders are these days.  Great price for what you get.
"
I love Stuff,5.0,2021 14 December,"
This is a really nice blender. Build quality is plastic, but quality plastic. Nothing feels flimsy or fragile. Everything works well from the buttons to the lid. That isn't what makes this blender stand out though. Its the blades. Every other blender with just one set of bottom blades makes crushing ice annoying. You have constant move the ice or add tons of liquid. Since these blades go all the way up the stem, ice or pretty much anything blends easily without stirring or with minimal stirring. Why don't other blenders do this? It is like every company out there releases the same blender over and over again. This style of blade is by far the best I have ever used. The price on this unit is also stellar for the wonderful blending this unit does. There is no other blender in the same price range that blends as well as this does.
"
Dusty Trails,5.0,2022 3 January,"
This blender is what to expect from a Ninja product. The pitcher is a nice size, and the blades are super sharp. I pureed some oranges quickly and effortlessly with this beast. Time will tell how it holds up. I will say I feel like the blender is too powerful for the materials it is built with, which may shorten its life, but way too early to tell. For now I have no complaints though and highly recommend for a powerful blender.
"
Lycanroc,5.0,2022 9 January,"
The blades are super sharp, which is great for the slicing. It worked really great for smoothies. I'm excited to try this out with other things.One thing I have to note is that there was a somewhat discernible smell when running the blender, but it was nothing too concerning. I'll update this review if anything happens to it.

 Pros:-The main thing I use a blender for is to make frozen cocktails. The ninja blender is the only one I have ever used that gives a thick consistency like you would get when going to a restaurant.-This can make snow out of ice cubes, I love using this for making certain cocktails like mint juleps.-Blender works great for all other needs. When making smoothies, it really liquifies most of the pulp, but there is still a very small trace of pulp that will be noticed when drinking.-Overall the blender is easy to use. Just keep in mind the blender has safety mechanisms so the lid must be on correctly, as well as the base, otherwise it won’t operate.Considerations:-The blade on this blender is very sharp. I am always nervous washing. However, as long as you are careful, it isn’t an issue.-This blender is a little taller than my past blenders and can’t fit below my cabinets on my counter.-This blender isn’t as strong as some of the other ninja blenders at only 1000 watts. My other blender is 1200 watts. However, I noticed that it still makes snow just as well.
"
Tom,5.0,2021 19 December,"
A nice sized, all purpose blender. Simple push button operation without the fancy program modes. The Ninja blenders do a great job with ice and are perfect for frozen drinks. Generous 72 ounce capacity, but you'll not want to fill it up that much unless you want a big mess on your hands. Easy to clean and dishwasher safe to boot.

I have a much more expensive blender that I've had for years and decided to give this a try. I make green shake smoothies every morning for my family and I am blown away at the power of this machine. It crushes ice incredibly well and puree's everything into a nice smooth consistency. This is really important for me because my daughter can't have ANY chunks even the tiniest chunk in any of her smoothies and this pulverizes everything so well! What a great price for such a powerful blender. Love it
"
Christopher Wells,5.0,2021 14 December,"
Absolutely love this blender. I also have the 3pc blender with the motor that hops to each size,  but this is less pieces to keep track of. Love that the lid locks on as well!

Ninja usually makes top-of-the-line stuff. And I am obsessed for a reason. So I thought this blender would be an excellent addition to my growing collection of Ninja kitchen goodies. Wrong.At first? The blender worked GREAT. Not too noisy. Nice balance of power for the price, and I do mean that! It's awesome for smoothies, gravies and soups, which is ALL I have used it for. One day I heard a little crack sound and there's a little crack forming at one corner of the jar. Not even any ice cubes or anything in there heavy.It hasn't full on cracked open but I am watching it closely. I don't like having to use an appliance wondering about another shoe potentially dropping in the form of a blender jar cracking open mid-cycle.Will it crack all the way? I don't know. I think it's the vibrations of the unit that cause that. I've never had a blender jar crack on me before, even the esteemed old blender my mother has been using for 30 years.I will update if it cracks all the way. In the meantime, I also noticed it's starting to have a hard time blending my spinach for smoothies. This makes me sad, I prefer to blend my greens for the added fiber benefit. Not sure I want chunks like this in my smoothies. I have to run it a little longer just to get it all, and increasingly finding bits in my smoothies.

Wade N,3.0,2022 10 February,"
I really liked the strength and the power of this Ninja NJ601 blender in blending and mixing a variety of food and ingredients. It does not produce a very annoying noise. The blades are very sharp and are very successful in crushing and mixing a wide range of compounds. The cleaning of the pitcher and the blades is easy and the pitcher has a fairly large size which makes it suitable for soup blending, making large amounts of frozen drinks and shakes.There are also some issues that I noticed with this model. Firstly, the pitcher material (BPA-free plastic) does not seem to be very durable and is not very resistant to some scratches that might happen during the ice crushing. I also noticed that there are some other models available from Ninja with more powerful motors (1400 or 1100 Watts) at the same price. For instance, Ninja BN701 and Ninja BL660  are equipped with stronger motors with exactly the same price (at the moment) and as I know, the motor power is directly related to the crushing and mixing power of the blender! Another issue that I noticed is the relatively weak front panel design. I see that on some other models, Ninja has done a much better job to give a variety of options to users to choose the type of mixture that they want. Here, we only see 3 power settings and this may not be so easy for some beginner users to choose the right power for their blending.Overall, the blender does a great job of doing the main functions of blending and crushing and the blades seem to be durable (based on the time that I've been using the blender!). However, I personally expected a better design and some more features from the Ninja and its current blender (Ninja NJ601AMZ).

Works really well. Easy to clean. I just wish this model either included the single serve options or that my older ones worked on it.
"
Walker Henley,2.0,2022 23 May,"
I make a lot of smoothies, and my cheap $30 Oster did a better job than this thing. Square pitcher with circular blades = can't blend the little bits. I end up with bits of oats and flax in my not-so-smooth smoothie. Seems powerful and i like the little single-serve options, but overall i wouldn't recommend this product.
"
Daniel,1.0,2022 8 May,"
Bought this ninja for 69.99 and it didn’t even made it a year and the pitcher broke, it first started shattering then finally broke. The replacement pitcher is 64.95… so now I have a $5.04 blender with no pitcher GREAT.
"
Beachat,1.0,2022 12 July,"
Add ingredients like blueberries kale water ice etc. it doesn’t blend well and the result is gritty and foamy. I do not recommend.

"
CoCo's Mom,5.0,2021 13 December,"
But, there have been times where I would like to blend up something other than a smoothie. This is powerful and works great. You can crush ice in this and have the ease to make frozen drinks. Much better than many blenders.

Ash,5.0,2022 10 September,"
Honest review incoming--I've had KP my entire life & have tried literally every product available (all the scrubs, exfoliating creams/body washes, special razors, etc) & nothing worked. Since I began using this around 2 yrs ago my legs are completely smooth and moisturized. I apply this lotion to my entire body after my evening shower & that's it! And if I skip using this lotion for a few days...the bumps & itchiness are creeping back. It really works & has given me so much confidence in my skin.

EileenMCastro,5.0,2022 28 April,"
Bought this because I couldn't find the usual brand I get and I was not disappointed. I just got this 3 pack today and suffer from super dry elbows and knees. I've used it 3 times today and I can already tell there's a huge difference in my elbows. With the previous brand I used I loved the smell and used it daily when I was at work but often forgot it and by the time I got back to work my elbows were like alligator elbows again. For being gone for two days the product I'm used to didn't seem to do too much if 2 days later I'm dry again. Not to mention it was soooo greasy which can make working a bit of a pain as we use an iPad for our system. This stuff is non-greasy though and is awesome.I see a lot of people complaining about the new smart pump but I personally haven't had any issues with it. It takes two seconds to just look at which end the lotion will come out of. It's not like it's super inconvenient. There's an arrow that points in the direction of which end it will come out of, and if you just look at the end of the pump you can see which one is the lotion end as there's some left over lotion from pumping. I just think people aren't really paying attention and find the smart pump a lot better than the old pump.As for there being a bunch of lotion left over at the bottom I couldn't say as I just bought this lotion so I'll update this when I get to that point. But to be honest with every lotion there's always been a bunch of lotion left over so I don't really see the problem. I guess the issue is the fact that the top is extremely difficult to take off if not impossible.

Katherine A. Morgan,5.0,2022 2 August,"
This is the best dry skin remedy that I have found. Most dry skin products are totally absorbed - gone in a couple hours and my skin is dry itchy and flakey. Vaseline with cocoa butter gives relief for my skin up to a couple of days! It's never greasy feeling and smoothes out further than some of the sticky thick feeling lotions. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering. They make Vaseline with cocoa butter as well but it's greasy and attracts my dogs fur that tends to be everywhere no matter how often I sweep, mop, dust etc. I resend this to anyone with dry flakey skin.

I used it after a shower, it’s a nice moisturizer, smells like classic cocoa butter, and it’s not super thick, nor is it greasy.I see a lot of people complaining about the smart pump as well, but im having 0 issues with any of my three bottles. you turn the smart pump to lock and unlock it, and it comes off of the top of the bottle with a simple twist. Idk what everyone else is talking about honestly.However, the expiration date (i think???) on this bottle is concerning. I didn’t realize till after i used it the first time after my shower, but there’s a small “02/02” on the bottom of my bottle (all the bottles have different dates on the bottom of them, but they’re all super past the date). im not even sure if that’s an expiration date, or if you can use “expired” lotion, but it didn’t cause any irritation to my skin and it seems like it did it’s job, so im not sure what that’s about.
"
LittleItaly,5.0,2022 9 June,"
I have been using this product for quite some time. Have it on auto-ship.  It's always consistent.  The one thing I do not like - you cannot open the bottle.  It only has a pump so when it gets low you have to throw it away... to me feels like wasting some of the product.  This is a new design from before.  I'm not a fan.

With the repeated washing of hands the natural moisture also washes away leaving sandpaper like feel of  hands. I have used several different brands of moisturizing lotions only to leave a greasy feel and repeated applications.  Until NOW!  VASELINE INTENSIVE CARE is what DOCTORS should prescribed!  Moisturizing that penetrates and NOT sit on the skin, that takes care of the crocodile cracked skin leaving a soft touchable  feel..  The scent is subdued!  No loud perfume smell. Men to baby's can wear on  face to toes.  The PRICE is right.  PERFECT lotion.  JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED! 👌  🥰

Saiida M,4.0,2020 20 April,"
I love this lotion and like others have been using it for years. It is a great go to after shower before bed all around feel good for the skin. It has made my skin smoother than ever.  I was getting compliments. Which is why I may have to write to the company Unilever and tell them this new smart pump was a dumb idea. I Soo agree with the below comments and everyone that said you have to cut through the bottle with a sharp knife to get that last 1/3 or 1/4 or whatever and this lotion being about $8 in CVS or Meijer I thought it would be cheaper to buy from Amazon. The first time before Covid 19 (About August 2019). I got the three pack big bottles 24.5oz  for $23 no smart pump(that's one with extra 20%). This time because of a relisting I got three 20oz smart pump bottles and was going to return but will keep because this stuff is becoming rare in the stores. Next time, I will try Walmart because it's about $6 and then I will stock up. Hope this really helps someone that's new to Amazon or this product.

Okay so I just received mine today and the smart pump it was okay. They all say that the close and open are confusing well they are not. Horizontal is closed and vertical is open. The smell is okay, not very potent but it smell like artificial chocolate which not too bad and it is not oily but it kinda leaves a sticky feeling but not much and it disappears for few minutes. I will update more for month or so to see my skin condition.

I love this lotion, I've used it for the last 17 years and have never had any problems with it. I even used it on all of my children as newborns.... But recently they've made a new bottle with a new ""smart pump"" , the one to the right. With this new ""smart pump"" you can NO LONGER TAKE THE CAP OFF OF THE BOTTLE. I am not happy about this. There is about an inch of lotion in the bottom of the bottle that the new ""smart pump"" is not pumping out of the bottle!!! I now have to resort to cutting the bottle open to get ALL of the lotion out of the bottle. Please take the new ""smart pump"" back and give original bottle back, to the left.

The basic product is fine.  The new ""Smart Pump"" is not.  First of all, when you turn the top, as you must to get it to pump out the lotion, both sides of the top look the same.  So you can't tell which side the opening is on.  After two times of accidentally squirting lotion all over my table, I finally resorted to using a light colored nail polish to paint the half of the top that contains the openings.Today when I went to use some lotion after not using any from one particular bottle (I bought three bottles) fir a few days, nothing would come out.  I examined the opening and saw that these tiny  little holes were clogged.  So I had to use a pin to clear them out.  I have never has a pump type of lotion clog up like this before.Also, it does not appear that the pumping mechanism can be unscrewed from the bottle!  It appears to be fused onto the bottle as opposed to being a threaded screw top.Sometimes in life it is good to just stick with time-tested methods!  New is not always better.

I’ve been using Vaseline for sometime now I love it I’m not really happy with Vaseline for bringing out the new smart pump but that’s not the person who selling it’s fault it’s the company’s fault so I gave it a five out of five love the lotion great price for them because they are  three big bottles of lotion I will most definitely continue to Buy my lotion from you

I like the lotion and have been using it on my legs after shaving for a couple years now. I usually just buy at the grocery but with quarantine going on, I looked into other options. I was excited to see this product pictured with the old style pump. But when it arrived, it was the new style pump which leaves a lot in the bottle and can't be removed. I literally cut off the top with a razor blade to get at the leftovers - which lasted me another week. I'll use up what I have but will not buy again.

"
Catherine,4.0,2021 18 January,"
This lotion is absolutely amazing. Love love love this scent and the way it makes me and my children skin feel. The one downside is that the pump part of the lotion was extremely difficult for me to use. Took about 10 minutes of moving and playing with it in order for the lotion to start pumping out. Other than that, I have no complaints. Please fix the pump
"
SayaMenuki,5.0,2021 12 February,"
Vaseline lotion is an excellent moisturizer for dry skin and many people are surprised when they ask me where I got wonderful scent I use.I live in a very dry climate especially in the winter. So I do have to apply it a few times a day to my dry skin areas.It’s light and not oily.The 3 pack for this price is a great deal as well.

For the price, this lotion does the job.  Not greasy.  I am not a fan of the cocoa scent, but that is just personal preference.
"
Cathy Diviney,5.0,2021 18 August,"
I love Vaseline cocoa butter lotion ! I use it everyday after my shower and I even have a bottle on my table in the tv room and one in our second bathroom.I highly recommend !
"
LeStarra,4.0,2021 25 April,"
Great lotion, but the new bottle head is annoying - it's identical on each side, so I've accidentally squirted lotion onto sheets/floors/my nightstand because I put my hand under the wrong side.
"
Stephanie Garnenez,5.0,2021 17 February,"
I had an exceedingly challenging time getting this lotion locally. Having to wash our hands more often now than before, we needed something that would moisturize but not leave us feeling greasy. This product does just that. I don't have to keep reapplying or wash my hands again to get the greasy feeling off. Excellent product and a genuinely nice price.

"
royal taylor,4.0,2021 18 January,"
Vaseline products are products you can rely on, and this lotion is no different. It goes on smooth and with the added cocoa butter, the lotion heals and moisturizes. I have rough dry skin. Try it for yourself and see if it doesn't do wonders on your skin too
"
Ginny,5.0,2021 20 December,"
Love this product. Very moisturizing
"
Mary Snyder,5.0,2021 25 April,"
Doesn't look like the bottle but still the same and works really nice, I use it on my whole body after a shower and definitely makes my skin soft and keeps the itchiness away, gets rid of ashy skin and heals all while wearing it so really worth the money everytime.
"
Am&Am,3.0,2021 8 October,"
This lotion would be so much better if the pump didn’t look the same on both sides. I’m a person that likes to put lotion on in the middle of the night, and since I can’t identify the pump by feeling it my entire nightstand is covered in lotion! Not cool… not cool…
"
Steve C Robbins,5.0,2021 8 July,"
Definitely my favorite lotion BY FAR. Leaves my skin feeling moisturized and not greasy in the slightest. Only time I stop using it is if I wanna give something else a try but I always come back to this one.

"
Lightning Maximus,4.0,2020 1 April,"
If you skin is tender, dries out quickly, and is prone to cracking/peeling, then Vaseline Intensive Care Body Lotion, Cocoa Radiant is the product for you. This lotion is especially helpful if you shave regularly, spend a lot of time outdoors, or take a beating from dry climates. Personally, I'd prefer a squeeze bottle to a pump dispenser, but it's workable for all intents and purposes. Try it out, and see for yourself!

Tonya Miller,4.0,2020 12 September,"
Sadly I thought they were regular cocoa butter but they have an extra fragrance added to them.  I can't use fragrance due to sensitive skin and allergies so I cant use them.  Be aware that the smell isn't just a cocoa butter smell with this brand
"
Lori,5.0,2020 17 January,"
I love everything that has cocoa butter! I was searching for a moisturizer for several weeks and when I came across Vaseline brand, I didn’t think twice to try this out cause I’ve always loved their products and I’m glad I bought. You get 3 of the same sized bottles and a little lotion goes a long way! Makes your skin feels soft and smooth without that greasy feeling.Will be buying more for sure

This lotion not only smells nice but it's non greasy and very moisturizing. My only issue is that the price went up a whole $4 from the last time I ordered the same product, same amount about three months ago. That's not good
"
Jacquelyn Crumpler,1.0,2022 29 September,"
I’ve bought this lotion from a grocery store in the past and enjoyed the scent, but when I first put this on it smelled a little funny, so much that I checked to see if it expired. All three are well past their expiration dates, and it’s noticeable. After checking reviews, it seems like a common issue. Don’t chance it!
"
LaKrysta Haley,5.0,2021 15 June,"

Sonnet,5.0,2019 24 June,"
I’ve always bought the cheap Walmart lotion, but I got to thinking that Vaseline (petroleum jelly) is the best moisturizer i’ve Ever used, it’s just not practical. So I bought a few different Vaseline brand lotions (this body lotion and a lotion for hands and nails). They cost more, but do not disappoint. The times where I still grab the Walmart lotion I feel dry shortly after. With this my skin doesn’t feel dry for awhile. I will buy again, although this is certainly plenty.
"
Vanessa,5.0,2021 28 May,"

APT,1.0,2022 26 February,"
I love this brand but the distributor sent very expired products dated 1/2004, 1/2009 and 1/2014 (see pictures).  The product is very thin, runny and the odor is overbearing.  Normally there is a thickness to it letting you know there is petroleum in it.  Instead of cocoa butter, this seems “perfumey”.  Not happy.  Want a refund without having to go all the way to the post office and to buy a new shipping package (through out the box it came in because I did not expect lotion to be expired! 😡).  Would be happy with a refund and to throw this crap out.  Not worth the effort to return wasting time, gas and effort!  (Otherwise the brand is excellent as I’ve used for years).  March 2022 UPDATE: refund was received from Amazon.

I've been using this for years on my face now, apparently it works because I am in my mid 30's and continually get complimented for looking like I am in my late 20's. Vaseline, please don't ever change or do away with this product, or if you do, at least a heads up so I can stock up. Also, smells great, like warm vanilla.
"
Pat,5.0,2018 6 July,"
I love this lotion! I first tried it at my friends house during vacation in the hot AZ sun and kept using it daily. It kept me moisturized all day long, brought out a nice tan, and wasn't greasy or slimy feeling on my legs. The smell is nice and light, and doesn't have that gross DHA self tanning scent. As soon as I got back home to IL from vacation, I ordered this 3 pack right away and it will always be a staple in my home,
"
C.A. Gray @ChiBabyMine,5.0,2018 25 August,"
This 3 pack of Vaseline brand cocoa butter body lotion is a great deal, and my go-to body lotion. Apply after showering and feel baby soft for days! It has a mildly sweet scent I love, typical to cocoa or shea butter. And I'm paying much less for it here than I was at the drug or grocery store. I go through this stuff pretty quickly and will buy again. 20.3 fl oz per bottle for a total of 60.9 fl oz.

I use this lotion daily and have done so for years. I usually purchase it directly from Walgreens, but thought it would be more convenient to buy on Amazon. The lotion was watery and had no smell.  It was either different lotion put into the bottles or the product was not stored properly and the attributes changed DRAMATICALLY. I threw them away and am back to purchasing from Walgreens.  Good luck

Super moisturizing and smells good. It even makes my stubbly legs smoother to the touch a week or so after a shave. I'm a brand junkie when it comes to my skin, and I love this stuff. No other lotion for me

I have used this Cocoa lotion for years, I have loved it and it is has been my only lotion until now. The new smell is awful, and the pump is ridiculous; it leaves about 2 weeks worth of lotion at the bottom and there is no way to remove it - what a waste.  The photo shows the old style of pump, but I received the new style of pump. With the new pump, you can't tell which side the lotion comes out of, so I often end up with lotion on the counter.  Plus at times the pump pinches my hand - unbelievable!  Did Vaseline do any product/packaging testing at all???

It doesn't work for my skin, but it does for my son. He loves it. I mix mine with Vaseline petroleum jelly.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2017 9 June,"
This has been my go-to lotion since adolescence. Makes my skin look and feel healthy and radiant. I have fairly sensitive skin, and a few other cocoa butter lotions have given me rashes in the past, but Vaseline never lets me down.

MoG,2.0,2018 4 December,"
Pros: price, packaging, amount you get for priceCons: I bought the regular bottle from the store and definitely feels different. The one on amazon feels like it doesn’t have as much moisture so I have to use more to get the same feeling as the store one.Update: I tried it again and it’s DEFINITELY a thinner consistency then what I get at the store; so I have to use more and for some reason this formula feels like it doesn’t even sink into the skin...not a fan really
"
Danni,2.0,2020 1 January,"
This used to be such a great lotion a few years ago with an amazing scent. It was not heavy but moisturized well.Obviously, Vaseline changed everything about it.The pump is crazy, it smells horrible like alcohol and it never seems to sink into my skin. It just sits on top and is sticky.It still cheap but not worth it.Really sad day for Vaseline lotion. Definitely not purchasing again.

The lotion is pretty good, but the “new and improved” is a deal breaker (pun intended);  dispenser broke after only a couple of uses. I’m not the first one who got screwed by the new dispenser - I saw several complaints on Amazon. Needless say, I won’t buy it anymore.

"
Attitude498,1.0,2022 17 January,"
I've purchased the Coco Radiant before and even as a gift (which I now am embarrassed to say), but the scent has been changed.  It smells moldy, unnatural, and toxic.  Viewing other reviews (Walmart) I can see that I am not the only one who noticed this.  Very disappointed because I LOVED this lotion.

I’ve been buying this product for about 10 years from grocery and drug stores. I use it every night and have always liked the product and never had a problem with it. The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle is that it smelled slightly different from what it usually smells like. I applied it as usual and about 20 minutes later my skin got very irritated and hives started breaking out in some places. I’ve never had problems with this lotion before which leads me to believe it’s not from a reputable source.

It’s really good moisturizer for whole body. It has good consistency and smell is very light. I still feel that consistency of moisture is not long lasting.

Recently I purchased the 3-pack online and when I got it I was completely surprised by the scent - it's horrible.  I can't explain the scent but all three bottles have the same scent so they must have changed the formula. Definitely finding a new lotion.

I love this product but zero ratings for the smart pump design. It is very brittle and broke easily with little pressure. Although I was able to unlock the smart pump, it never worked and was jammed. This bottle is useless to me as I can't pump the vaseline cream.Pump should be simple to use and NOT oversmart to cause trouble.

I’ve been using Vaseline products, specifically the lotion, for probably 20 years...this lotion burns my hands now and has a weird chemical smell to it.  I don’t know if Vaseline changed their formula or what but this is not the same thing I’ve been using.
"
Nic,2.0,2022 5 October,"
Not sure of anyone else notices but the new bottles with the big “V” on them, they changed the formula from the original. They added the ingredient Coumarin which is also used in rat poison. I will buy as much of the older bottles I can find because I love that one and the scent, but not these new bottles. They did the same with the Vaseline Petroleum Jelly with cocoa butter. The “Limited Edition” tubs now have coumarin. But do what you want. Also when I asked about this change on the actual Vaseline website they erased my comment.

"
Catch22,1.0,2022 28 October,"
The new ""Smart Pump"" has an unremovable top. The tube down to the lotion is too short, leaving about a quarter bottle unused before the pump can't reach it. You can't remove the pump easily or at all, so if you want to be economical you have to either cut the bottle open to reach the remaining lotion, or perhaps get channel lock pliers to break the pump off (haven't tried yet, and I suspect it will break the pump mechanism). Also the pump is symmetrical with a hole on only one side. Each time you pump you have to feel for the hole or else you will spray lotion on the floor instead of on your hand.Overall this ""Smart Pump"" bottle is a scumbag move by this company. I will deliberately avoid buying this product in the future, even if I find the lotion to be just okay.Edit: with a flathead screwdriver I was able to remove the lid...it kind of unscrews with coarse threads. There is a barrier that prevents rotation...a screwdriver can bypass the rotation lock. It is still a cynical design based on the fact that a percentage of consumers won't be able to do this
"
Sharon Robertson,1.0,2020 13 July,"
Something was wrong with the order I've got it smelt like bug spray and didn't moisturize my hands. I'm pretty sure I received a fake product because I've ordered this before and it was fine then.

Horrible new scent!  Do NOT buy this unless you like lotion with an overpowering chemical smell.  YUCK!  The old formulation had a rich, warm, fabulous cocoa butter scent.  The new smell is positively ANNOYING.  Power plant with a hint of faux flora note.  What were you thinking, Unilever?  Ugh.

The lotion itself is great I love it.  The new pump is awful.  Both sides look the same, can’t tell you how many times I’ve squeezed it from the wrong end and got the lotion all over.  Finally painted half the top white so I know which end is which.  Don’t let’s kids anywhere around this pump unless you don’t mind it being everywhere.  Seriously how did this even make it out of product design let alone testing.  Idiots need to be fired.  Won’t buy this product again till they fix the design.

I have used this product for years, and I love it.  It keeps my skin moist and prevents itching due to dryness.  I do have one complaint, though, and I am posting it here in hopes that the manufacturer sees and responds.  Recently the manufacturer has changed the pump bottle so that you can no longer unscrew the pump top when the lotion level gets low.  I have, in the past, taken the top off and tipped the bottle over to get the remaining lotion out of the bottom of the bottle.  There is almost always quite a bit of lotion that will not come up through the pump when the level gets low.  Now that I can no longer unscrew the top, I have had to resort to using a box cutter to cut the top of the bottle off.  I refuse to let the last bit go to waste.  Please, manufacturer, give us back a screw-off top.

I have super dry skin year round but when fall hits wow it gets bad.  I hate when my cuticles start to crack and ruin my manicure.  This stuff Is nice and thick, goes on smooth, has a nice scent and really lasts.  I am an OCD hand washer at the office so this will go fast, lotions on last me about a month before I have to Re Up. Every Vaseline product I have tried has been great.  Keep up the good work!  You got a customer for life 
"
David morales lee,3.0,2021 10 September,"
Other reviewers are correct. When using a serated knife to cut the bottom of the bottle to get the lotion, you will wonder why you bought it.

Eric H. Pangman,5.0,2019 24 May,"
I've been using this product for years. I apply all over after my shower while still wet. I have a big TIP...when the plunger no longer sucks up lotion for application, just cut the bottle in half about 3 inches from the bottom. I guarantee there will be 2-3 ounces left that would otherwise get thrown out. I suggest a rebuild on the bottle to make it good to the last drop.

What imbecile conceived of this dispenser idea?It’s absolutely idiotic! All I can say is; some product designer on another continent (most likely far eastern) is either hanging his head in shame or having a jolly good laugh.I positively canNOT imagine what the point is of a double headed identical nozzle that only squirts from one side (and half of time you don’t get the right side until you have put some sort of a marker on the top of it so you KNOW which side is going to dispense the lotion.  And if you’re using it in a subdued lighting situation, that does not always work. Half of it ends up on the floor, on the table top, or somewhere else! Every time it happened, I became SO angry, and that is not my nature!But seriously, HELLO?!!!I eventually put the contents into another ‘normal’ dispenser I found at a general store.First and last time for this PETROLEUM BASED PRODUCT.
"
V. Kneifl,1.0,2022 24 January,"
I've used Vaseline intensive care for years. I love the product, but hate the new dispenser that turns. When I'm in a hurry, I might have it turned the wrong way and it dispenses all over the wall, the vanity, you name it. The thing eventually plugs up and even if I have it turned in the right direction, it sprays straight up, to the side, everywhere but in my hand. I'm considering changing to a different product just to avoid the hassle of getting it out of the container. I finally poured it into a Mason jar and dip out what I need with my fingers!

"
Elga Suarez,1.0,2021 30 August,"
Whoever had the idea to change the pump on the bottle obviously does not use the product. I have used this lotion for over 30 years and will never buy another bottle with this new pump. If you need a video to learn how to open a pump on a bottle, then there is a serious issue with the product.  I also agree with the reviews that you can no longer open and remove the top, leaving a lot of lotion in the bottle !
"
Amber Fulford,2.0,2021 4 April,"
I'm not really sure how to feel about this lotion. I love the feel of it on my skin, but the smell is not the same. It doesn't smell like cocoa butter anymore, not really sure what it smells like but it isn't a good smell

Good overall and tend to like this brand better than others..I liked it so much as I always buy 1 at a time,,this 1 time I bought the 3 pack and the 2nd bottle top to unlock and work,, does nothing but go around in circles. Maybe broke in shipping process or the inspector missed this defect  none the less I bought this with good faith and wasted my time and money..I will switch brands soon that actually work.

You can’t go wrong with Vaseline Shea cocoa butter lotion. It takes the ash away leaving your skin smooth and soft. It is also reasonable price and gets the job done by hydrating your skin. Amazon had buy $30 worth of products and get 10 dollars off, so I 6 bottles for $21.00 and some changes. You can’t beat that deal. I highly recommend this lotion.

This is great lotion, but their new ""smart"" pump is a pain. It would be smart if it were at least a half inch longer. As it is, it's too close to the bottle and makes it easy to splooge lotion down the front. Grr.

Vaseline is a good product for the price. Shop around and compare prices to your local stores if you only want 1 bottle. I bought the 3 pack and it didn't save me much money but it was convenient to buy it online. It's the right amount of thickness to put on your whole body (not a thin watery lotion or a super heavy cream), smooth and smells good.

This is not the same lotion that I’ve used for the last ten years. I thought that they were just changing the shape of the bottle, but they also changed the fragrance.

I have lotion every where so it keeps my hand moisturized. I have one by the sink, bedroom, and living room just because how dry my hands get from washing them all the time. Doesn’t have that super water texture or oily feeling. It’s not too thick. I definitely love it, it’s a light scent of cocoa butter so it isn’t overwhelming. I also like the pump, it’s easy to push down and not to much of struggle to keep pushing. Recommend!

J. J. Moses,4.0,2022 28 September,"
I like the fact that these don't have any harsh chemicals in them but make sure you follow the directions for use okay you're going to have to surround your deck or whatever are you're sitting in exactly as it describes and that involves sticking these things in the ground and lighting them standing straight up in sort of a triangle fashion every 12 feet or so around the area you're going to be in 10 to 20 minutes before you're going to be occupying the area you want these to have time to get going. If you do it right, they actually work. And I think they're better than bug zappers because bug zappers get mostly moths and about 10% top mosquitoes. I only took one star off because you know set up is a little a bit of a pain but you know it's worth it. Because it first you're thinking hey it's an incense stick let me just put it in this incense holder here on the porch and light it that's not how it goes. Follow the instructions to a t and you have yourself a barrier shield from the mosquito but I don't really care for the smell too much which you don't have to deal with a lot if you follow the directions. I will continue to use them.
"
Nathalie,4.0,2022 31 October,"
I suppose using just 1 might not be as efficient in the hot south, but I place 3-4 in flower pots around the decks and have not had mosquito problems. Love that they last about 1 hr (I also have long coils for extended period of time). Love that I can turn it off to finish later by pressing the hot end on a stone.
"
Wendy,4.0,2022 10 October,"
We had a bad mosquito problem this year. I tried everything, the electric zappers did nothing . Repellant for skin was so so. Lit one of these up in the house. Very soft pleasing scent that fills the room fast. Don’t even have to burn the whole stick. The mosquitos seemed to have disappeared! Burned one on our patio, never saw one while it was burning. This is definitely my go too next season. You get enough incense to last for a long time because you only have to burn a couple to see them go away. Great find
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 2 November,"
We sit outside to give out Halloween candy and are always swatting mosquitoes and other flies away as it gets dark. I lit a few of these and put them in holders around our sitting area, and it kept all the bugs away. Each lasts about 45 minutes, but the package has a huge supply that we have enough for the next 2 Halloweens. Totally recommend these!
"
Surmai Lee,5.0,2022 16 October,"
Usually something will bite me as long as I stepped out site for a few minutes. I tried essential  oil spread, mosquito bracelet. They help but I have to keep adding more spread, sometimes I still got bitten. I brought this for me for working in the garage. I seems worked, nothing bit me for a good 10 minutes, then I put it in my bag walk around the property, It keeps the bugs away from me. So far I only used twice, but it seems to work.

This is the mosquitoe insense to buy! This is the only one that smells like my grandmother used to use back in the 90s. It works too! No mosquitoes anywhere around after a few of these are lit; even when they were just there! Highly recommend buying this brand even if they cost a little more. They actually for reals work!!!
"
Luis,5.0,2022 29 October,"
I spend a lot of time outside in the yard in the summer evenings.  Mosquitos attack!  You know, this works well and each stick lasts about 1/2 hour.  So, it's perfect!
"
Cara A.,4.0,2022 23 September,"
They were great! …for two weekday evenings with friends for a few hours. We went through the entire package (burning one at a time) in two evenings. :( they smell great and they work well. Just a bit overpriced given the burnout time.
"
T. Thompson,5.0,2022 15 October,"
So far has worked well to keep away the small pesky mosquitoes. We light and place in raisedPlanter near our “California room” and seems to work in that 10-15 foot area.  Might need more for larger areas. Smell is tolerable.
"
Victoria ,5.0,2022 10 October,"

A_diva,3.0,2022 4 October,"
Didn’t get bit by mosquitoes but it seems you need to use a ton of these to get effective coverage. I was using a pod tent , so only for 1 person.  I thought 1 is sufficient. What I noticed is it made a barrier somewhat but in a limited way. So the mosquitoes were all piling up at the ceiling of my tent which was a very odd situation. None came near me but they seemed trapped in my tent to avoid fumes. I had it at front of tent so I expected they wouldn’t come in at all. Instead they came in but tried to avoid the smell as best as possible. So I guess it works I’m just thinking if I tried to use this at a picnic outside it be best to have multiple around the perimeter versus at the table for instance . Seems to act like a small barrier

"
katiejomcd,4.0,2022 23 June,"
There's probably no bug repellant that works 100% but we do notice a nice difference when these are lit. We put them in a wide circle around us, or in the corners of where we are and within a few minutes we are swatting less at our arms and legs. The smell is distinct, but it's a lot like a campfire and it doesn't bother our family. They last about 45 minutes each; wish it were longer, but it's not a big deal to light another round. We use them camping and when we're sitting around in our backyard at home. I ordered another pack!

"
Kathy,4.0,2022 9 July,"
Like the repellent sticks. They are effective in keeping bigs away from the picnic area but leaves a heavy ash below the area they are burning . I have to move the sticks further away so the ash does not get on tables or clothing, or pool. I think burning two at a time further away will be effective.
"
John F. Jamele,5.0,2022 17 September,"
I put about a dozen of these around a large yard and driveway during an all-day summer party last month and they really seemed to keep the flies away despite copious use of alcohol, sodas, barbecue, cake, chips, fruit....they work!

L F,5.0,2022 5 September,"
I've used other sticks like this before and their effectiveness is questionable. These 100% work in all my experience over this recent summer. If you have one lit and you carry it with you, zero bites. Easy to put out and stick in a potted place to re-light the next time you go out. 10/10
"
Fredy Garcia,3.0,2022 17 October,"
Great to pair these with something else like a hanging zapper. The smoke wasn’t as thick as I thought to deter all of the mosquitoes. Scent was alright, but not pleasant to smell for an hour. Although it probably did have some effect, it unfortunately was not enough to stop the bites entirely
"
Tim,5.0,2022 27 September,"

Nikki CS,5.0,2022 12 August,"
I received these and couldn’t wait to try after reading reviews. I have many different things I use to fight those little enemies outside BUT these are nice and easy to deal with! My husband gets bit up more than the rest of us but I lit one of these last night and he didn’t complain once! The smell isn’t bad and is similar the regular incense. I would consider lighting a few and I thought it came with a holder but it does not. Overall, I would order again and recommend these!

Was skeptical at first but wow these worked the first few minutes I was outside!! I read the reviews and they all sounded too good to be true. Will definitely be ordering more because we still have a long way to go for mosquito season where I live. I’m so glad I can sit outside and not get attacked by dozens of mosquitos. I wanna try them indoors cuz I have some that go in from my back door but I haven’t just yet.

Matt,5.0,2022 25 July,"
They actually work and last a decent time. I have a medium size pool and spaced about 8 around, didn't see a single mosquito. One night had a few people over and saw quite a few mosquitoes, after lighting some they were gone in a few minutes. If you need something every single night you might need something else but for weekends/occasions I'd recommend.

It seems to be working so far. I used three of the incense at one time. I have only done this once but seemed to work. I think it has a nice fragrance if your used to incense burning . I’ve tried a number of things to be rid of getting bitten by mosquitoes and I think I found the method and product.

Happy Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 6 July,"
I sit outside all the time for hours and have noticed I never get bit when I light these incense. The minute one goes out or if I decide to not light one at all, I see mosquitoes hovering and usually go in with at least 3 bites
"
On-lineShopper,5.0,2022 24 July,"
These are nicely scented and easy to use. We lit a bunch and stuck them in flower pots around the perimeter of out seating area outside, and only the brave mosquitos entered the perimeter.
"
Char,5.0,2022 13 July,"
I love these. I keep old Oui yogurt jars with a little sand in them around our outdoor living space and justStand these in them, light them up and let them go. Pleasant smell and keeps the bugs away!! The best!

Matthew Dao,2.0,2022 21 October,"
Lit 4 of them around me while building a shed.  Mosquitoes still treated me like a buffet. I used the coils in the past with the same results. Not sure if it works for anyone else but it doesn’t work for me. Only the sprays have worked for me.

G80L,5.0,2021 30 June,"
So I bought these for my not so outdoorsy husband in an effect to bring him outside… turns out these won’t change a man but he will light them to keep me from getting eating up by the beautiful Texas state bird aka the mosquito! He made a Great Barrier Reef around my lovely sitting spot which is also known as the great mosquito breeding grounds for the angriest of all the mosquitoes here is Deep South Texas! Needles to say I had one MF try to bite my shoulder so we repositioned these not so lovely smelling incense &  Wala I have been saved! Not a bug has come near me! I sat outside gossiping with the gals & gaygals for an hour before we had to set up another insect barricade! So if you like to be outside for a few hours plan on burning 6-9 of them! We already ordered more!
"
JAU,5.0,2022 23 July,"
Used three on a small patio and was not bitten - which is a big improvement.

SomeGUY,5.0,2022 10 June,"
So far, happy because they stay lit.The cone ones did not stay lit so back they go.Outside at dusk in shorts and no shirt, no mosquitoes tonight.I also spray, but these NC skeeters are obnoxious.

I had high hopes, I’m not sure what other people are doing to get these to work but I have several lit around me and I’m holding two of them and I still have mosquitoes coming at me. Basically I am making myself smell like this smoke but it’s not helping keep the mosquitoes away, I’m disappointed.

Ana,4.0,2021 8 October,"
I live in Texas , so it’s fair to say I know how a few things about mosquito repellent!They run out too quickly , compared to GOUSO , the ones I used to buy here on Amazon , that’s why I only gave 4 stars .But they are as efficient, if they could just last longer …
"
Nana ,5.0,2022 19 June,"
Dispersed mosquitoes outside front door. Love the smell! That may just be me, but prefer this over some chemical solutions to the same problem, which even smell toxic.
"
Reviewer,5.0,2022 6 April,"
I can't believe these things work, but they do! After about 5 minutes of them being lit, no mosquitoes at all! As soon as they went out, back came the mosquitoes. They last for about 45 minutes, which is nice and they don't smell bad, in fact they sort of smelt pleasant.
"
griffin,5.0,2022 28 July,"
Works well
"
Crystal Mason,5.0,2021 27 June,"
These incense repellent really work! Not too strong and easy to light. After they burn out the bugs stay away for at least another hour or so. I gave 4 stars for value for money because you will need at least 3 or 4 packs to last the summer if you spend a lot of time outdoors on your patio or deck. You will need to burn at least 2 or three sticks at a time, I was on my deck for 5 hours and used 6 sticks.Also you will need a holder yo fit these incense sticks they are long and will leave ash on you patio or deck so be aware of that.Please sell a coffin box or holders to accommodate the size of the sticks and provide safety.
"
Armen,5.0,2022 13 April,"
I was skeptical at first because of the scented candles don’t work at all. These scented sticks are very affective. They have a burn time of 45 min and does not create an outstanding amount of smoke. I would recommend special for the price.
"
LMEA,4.0,2021 1 June,"
I have enjoyed using these and feel they are effective in keeping the mosquitoes away. I like that they are natural and the scent is not overwhelming. The reason I did not give them five stars is that they burn down super fast. We were doing some yard work this weekend and I kept having to light more. I suppose using the thicker sticks that have a longer burn time would be better. It’s difficult to imagine what you would use these for because the burn time is so short; I would estimate less than 30 minutes.
"

Used it to keep mosquitoes at bay, but when a breeze blew the smoke the other way, it didn’t work.  Still prefer using it over repellent.
"

Took these with me on vacation. It was awesome. Lit 3 of them before sundown around our cabana porch. My husband was shocked that he didn’t  get bit. Great for home too!!
"
Anna,4.0,2021 27 July,"
These work like a charm (I usually light 3 at a time, placed on the ground in incense holders) but I don’t like the smell. They are supposed to be natural but they smell of chemicals to me. I use another brand I much prefer as well.
"
Jay,4.0,2021 24 September,"
The only con is that each stick lasts for 15-20 mins. They burn fast. It it worked well and kept mosquitoes away. The smell wasn’t harsh like most products.

"
OhioMom,3.0,2022 4 January,"
Bought these for our back patio in Florida, but even with the incense burning 2 feet away from us there were still mosquitoes biting us. We had better luck keeping the bugs away when using regular incense that has more smoke when it’s burning.
"
Rebecca L Dudla,4.0,2021 26 July,"
Mosquitos are bad this year. I like to sit outside with the dog.  I light a few of these and do not get eaten up while I am outside!  Great natural alternative to bug spray!

Love4shopping,5.0,2021 2 November,"
These work great! At first I didn’t think they worked that well but it was because I didn’t follow the directions. You must put these all around where you will be sitting outside, I put them all around the patio behind the couches and they were great! No one was eating during our Halloween party :)

Sora,5.0,2021 23 September,"
Summertime is bug season and the mosquitoes and flies (yes, they bite to) are plentysome.  I use it in my inclosed garage at night and during the day, the bugs keep away. No stray bug coming in. Just light it up, let the smoke come out and it will do the rest. I recommend this product to all my friends.
"
Tanya,2.0,2022 13 August,"
Scent is good, easy to use but they didn't help with the mosquitos at all.

crissyr,2.0,2022 6 August,"

"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2021 14 August,"
Have used now for a couple of weeks now and it’s ok but still get some bites. I put three around the small porch we sit in but still get a few bites. It’s better than not having any at all. If we put these repellents down AND spray our ankles and arms we almost never get bitten by those pesky mosquitoes!  I will continue to use and see if anything improves. Maybe will use more to see if that helps…
"
Amber,5.0,2022 16 May,"

Miss Mary,5.0,2021 24 September,"
They work as they say the will. I'm not a big citronella fan, but when it comes to mosquitoes, I will do just about anything to keep them at bay. The price was a little high, but like I said, just about anything. And I was glad I bought these,  because they worked great.
"
Trasse,5.0,2021 18 October,"
This works great as I have a neighbor with a swimming pool they never use which is basically a mosquito farm now. Life is like it says and let burn for about 10 minutes and then you go out and there will be no mosquitoes to bother you
"
R&A B.,5.0,2021 4 December,"
We will put 3-4 of these upwind from where we sit when camping.  They last awhile, and work very well, even against the mosquitoes in N Michigan.  Up there they are so big they come with landing lights.

Ray,4.0,2021 14 August,"
It isn’t 100% effective….still got a couple bites, but better than usual.
"
The Forestgirl,5.0,2021 2 November,"
These really work repelling all insects including mosquitoes. They are long burning and deliver a nice drift of smoke that lingers in calm conditions, keeping bugs away.Update: these also drive away wasps, and they will not make nests on any surface exposed to the smoke.

"
Lava,3.0,2021 31 July,"
Indoor:  eliminated houseflies, reduced fruitflies, no effect on roaches.Outdoor:  No effect.  On the right, flies attack your left.  Left, flies go right.  Under the chair, flies go up your head.  A breeze blows them away better.I'm picky on how much smell is ""pleasant"".  The smell is certainly potent, but flies don't apparently notice.Value, though...$15 / 50 equals 30 cents a stick, no loss.

Justin Perez,4.0,2021 5 July,"

MB shops ,5.0,2021 1 August,"
These incenses are wonderful.  The aroma is very pleasant and they keep a large area protected from insects.  They come in a very practical packaging to store and thus keep them protected from moisture.  I highly recommend them for this summer season. it is a wonderful product for the price and value
"
Face,1.0,2022 19 October,"
Mosquitoes weren’t remotely deterred by these. I’ve found the 3 wick candles work best when working in the driveway at night. I only tried these because they’re cheaper and I assumed I could put one in multiple places having more affect but I was wrong

S.K.,1.0,2022 18 August,"
We lit the sticks went back in & waited 10-15 min (per the directions) before going out and they did not work for us at all. We were right beside the sticks and mosquitoes were still landing on us. I do not know if the don't work at all or if we just received a bad batch. We returned them and are looking for something different that is more effective.
"
David Freyer,1.0,2022 17 September,"
I must have got some bad ones.  I was watching the mosquitos fly right through the smoke and bite me.  The only way that I could keep bugs away was to hit them with the box!

"
Yani,5.0,2021 18 July,"
These work! Using them nearby entry to keep flies and mosquito from flying inside. They last about as long as a regular incense stick would, 30-40min. I looooove the fresh scent it gives off too! Only wish I had more!
"

Each stick lasts for about 45 minutes and the scent is pleasing.  Did a great job keeping our patio mosquito free!

D. Sapphire,1.0,2022 21 August,"
unfortunately there is not much to. say other than it does not work. lit 5 of these things in a circle around a very small sitting area, no wind to blow the smoke away. yet the mosquitoes were still all over me. can not recommend this product. the effectiveness reflects the cheap price.
"
Sharon O'Farrell,5.0,2021 1 June,"
Al of a sudden there are roaches all over my apartment.  I burn one stick in every room and the roaches do not like it.  Also, back door always open for my guide dog and flies and other bugs stay outside now.

Donna Propeck,1.0,2022 16 August,"
Took them to the Bahamas with us and we had them spread out all around the patio (underneath so we could be safe outside) and they were extremely hard to light and keep lit. Plus the bugs didn’t care about them. It was my wedding day/night and we all got bit up.

William A.,1.0,2022 9 August,"
I lit a bunch of these after days of burning only a few at a time. This honestly felt like it made the mosquitoes hungry. I watch mosquitoes hover in the smoke inhaling it like a joint. These are an absolute joke and the mosquitoes love them. Buy a citronella candle instead.

It burnt really fast, while it was burning the flying critters hovered above the smoke loving every minute of it. When I requested a refund Amazon gave me less than 24hrs to bring it back, like that all that I had on my schedule so I guess I’m screwed thanks Amazon but feels like you’re going down hill with these policy changes. Buyer beware!

christina,1.0,2022 19 April,"
We have mutant mosquitos that are active all day, come into our house, and bite multiple times.I wanted something non-toxic but this just doesn't work. It was a waste of money. I burned this while hosting an outdoor dinner with guests and everyone got completely eaten up. The rest of the package is sitting in a cabinet, waiting to be thrown away.We've moved on to a $40 bug zapper that works on mosquitos and flies. My father in law uses the same one in Florida and swears by it.

I was expecting better. Mosquitos did not seem at all deleted.

Alison Harris,5.0,2021 18 August,"
Easy to stick in grass or flower pots in the areas that you want to repel mosquitos.  So far it works well!
"
Gabriela,5.0,2021 16 September,"
Make sure to have it burning a litte bit before you actually are around it.

This product did not keep the flies away. The literally flew and landed on the stick and stayed on it till I flashed it away. Save your money, dont buy.

"
Daniel Johnson,1.0,2021 18 August,"
Had them lit up all around me about 24 inches apart in my back yard and the flying vampires literally flew right between the smoke from both sticks and made a safe and successful landing  on my thigh which was full of blood that I tried so hard to keep inside of my body. It casually drove its evil syringe into my blood filled thigh and I had so resort to the old tried and true method of the tricep powered palm of death that I summoned to come down upon it before it could realize it screwed up. Right after this unfortunate event for it, I quickly threw the ones I lit and the entire pack I had just received that day into the bonfire.
"
TammyB,2.0,2021 22 August,"
I can hardly smell anything, and that's because the sticks are very difficult to keep lit.  You have to keep lighting it, and when it is lit, it does nothing for flying insects.  Maybe I got a bad batch, too dry, too old - not sure.  It was promising, but did not work for me.
"
Sarabia Johnson,5.0,2021 30 July,"

After setting several of these through the yard with or without high winds, I could see all the mosquitoes flying, almost seemed, towards the inscents, like they were attracted to the heat and we still had to put on spray (the one sure fire way to not be bit).

I'm not sure how anyone wrote a 4 star review or higher on the efficacy of this product, but it certainly does NOT repel mosquitos.... or anything for that matter.It actually seemed to attract more bugs, including flies, which I never have on my porch.The only positive thing I can say regarding this product is the scent; it's pleasant and not overpowering.Otherwise, I would stick to good old citronella candles.
"
alex,1.0,2021 24 September,"
Easy to light up but the smell is not pleasant at all and mosquitos did not care at all, I did light 6 of them but mosquito kept coming and biting non stop,  I have couple of coils I light them up and mosquitos gone away, so product doesn't work, don't buy it.

These only last 45 minutes, the scent is overwhelming and makes my throat hurt. The mosquitoes still manage to bite my legs.The picture is of my right calf, after the sticks had been burning for 15 minutes. I have to burn at least 6 of them before they have any effect.
"
user,1.0,2021 26 July,"
The product does not repel bugs at all. I lit one on my porch, on a night with little to no wind. It lasted about 30 minutes and the bugs still swarmed the light on my porch just as much as without the incense. Waste of money for sure.
"
Hannah,1.0,2021 13 October,"
Save your money and burn some 4th of July punks, because that's exactly what they smell like. Expensive punks. They didn't repel anything and they stink. Not even a trace of citronella, or anything that resembles it. Just buy bug spray.
"
Jonathan Goodell,1.0,2021 13 July,"
After 3 days of use my throat is killing me.  I like to sit on my porch as the sun goes down.  Bought these for the mosquitos, but I guess it works better on hurting humans.No point in having them if you can't be near them.

"
Glen A,1.0,2021 5 August,"
Read the reviews. It’s BS. They don’t work at all. The flies, mosquitos, dragonflies literally landed right on the sticks while they were burning. Seemed to be attracting bugs more than keeping them away.

ChubbyMako,5.0,2021 30 May,"
These lasted over an hour at my house! The product claims only last 40/45 minutes, but I timed these for an hour, and the stick still had some life left. I love a product that exceeds it’s “life  expectancy”! This product works well at our house, We follow the recommendations and make sure we have them every 10 feet in the area that we are in. Now to be fair we are very aggressive treating mosquitos  on our property. We have our property sprayed monthly to control mosquitoes populations around our home, we use mosquito deterrents, candles, and we have mosquito deterring plants around our patio. So by no means are we only using these incense sticks to ward off mosquitoes. As someone who is a mosquito magnet, the combination of these products makes it so I can enjoy being outside, without being swarmed by mosquitoes. These sticks are effective, smell “good”, And are inexpensive. I’ll have one burning by our back door when my kids are running in and out of the backyard just to discourage mosquitos from sneaking in our home. When my dogs are sunbathing I’ll even go in light one for them so that they can enjoy themselves outside. These are a staple in our home during spring and summer, I would definitely recommend if you’re someone who loves being outdoors, but doesn’t love being covered in bug bites!Thanks for reading, hope this review is helpful!
"
Honey Bunz,4.0,2021 7 June,"
These works great for small areas or where the wind is non-existent. They have helped but they dont completely solve the problem either. But for what they are they do work better than expected and smell great.
"
BackyardGardener,5.0,2021 16 June,"
We've been using this out under our covered patio.  I filled a couple of clay pots with sand, and sat them at either end of the patio.  When we are outside, I will stick these in the sand and light them - sometimes one, sometimes both depending on the weather and how many flies or bugs we see.  I decided to measure the burn time on one today...it's not windy, and it's in the shade.  It's been going for one hour now, and has about 3/4"" left.  The scent is lemon/citrus/smoke and is very pleasant.  We don't see any mosquitoes, flies, bees, etc. when we have them burning.  I will definitely order these again.
"
NonnaDonna,5.0,2021 22 July,"
Each lighted stick lasts about an hour.  Three lighted sticks kept the flying insects away from our backyard deck.  Scent is more pleasant than a citronella candle.
"
Angie M.,5.0,2021 1 June,"
This smelled like regular incense. I was able to eat outside without getting bit by mosquitos and without flies getting onto my food so I’ll take it!  It worked for me!Easy to light and lasted a decent amount of time - it stayed burning the entire time we ate.Exactly as described and serves it purpose.
"
Nuk,5.0,2021 25 May,"
I do love this.  I started with citronella cones, those tiny pyramids but just burn around 20 to 25 minutes.  This is a much better deal.  You get a stick that burns much longer but not less in smoke.  It is also a great value.  It comes with a wooden stand, but honestly, it is better to just use a masking tape and you can stick it anywhere.  It is great that it also stops burning once it reach the bare stick.  It also works great for repelling insects and mosquitos.
"
Albert Fortner,5.0,2021 19 June,"
I took these when I went fishing, and I didn’t have a single bug on me. Highly recommend!
"
D'harans,1.0,2021 3 July,"
I have lit about 8 of these little incense sticks, 4 of them lit within 10 seconds of holding them within a constant flame, while 3 of them needed 20 seconds to begin to burn. The last one did not light. The plume (wisp of smoke) is tiny and takes awhile to saturate the area you will be sitting in. After sitting in the 'treated area' you can prepare yourself to be bitten. I have counted 6 mosquitos that I have seen in the last 15 minutes, and I am itching, likely from unseen mosquitos, on my thighs and ankles. I literally placed 4 sticks next to my foot. The same leg has been bitten, making me feel the repellent is actually an appetizer and I am the main course.
"
hj,2.0,2021 10 August,"
These just don’t work as well as the ones I usually get that are a little more expensive (Murphy’s). They also don’t smell as pleasant. I’ll be going back to the others.
"
Adam Machanic,2.0,2021 25 July,"
Very pleasant smelling incense. I looked down at one point and watched a mosquito literally fly right through the smoke -- just before it landed on my leg and bit me.Two stars, because it smells nice. Doesn't work at all.
"
J,5.0,2021 29 September,"
If you have ""The Blood"", you know. Dozens of giant swells in minutes, DEET is your favorite flavor of ice cream, you have bought every spray, fogger, fan, on the market and if someone leaves an upturned bowl in the yard you expel them from your family.Tonight I sprayed myself in my backyard liberally with 20% Deet after getting about 6 bites in 5 minutes. I lit 4 of these in an occult circle around myself and... not a bite for 30 minutes, after a bit I notice 3 new bites on my elbow and see them swarming... The circle of protection has extinguished!I relight 4 new ones and am back to enjoying the outdoors.I just bought 4 more packs, I have never owned a product that actually works before! Amazing.
"
energy101,5.0,2021 16 September,"
I burn these stink sticks when I'm sitting next to my pond in the backyard. The mosquitoes come out of the bamboo and harass me. I'd rather not wear insect repellent, so these are awesome. I think they actually smell really good.
"
Ree,1.0,2021 3 October,"

It didn’t work to keep the mosquitos away.  The smell is awful & makes me sick to my stomach.  Had to go inside to get away from the smell.  So maybe that’s how it works, gets you to leave the mosquito area & go inside.  The flies & mosquitos didn’t seem bothered by the smell, only the humans.

Tamika Jones,5.0,2021 25 August,"
I love to sit outside but lately the mosquitos have been so bad. I got this about 2 weeks ago and I use 2 a day and place them under my chair outside. I also bought the wooden incense holder for sticks and I must admit, no more mosquito bites while sitting outside. They last about 30 minutes. I love them so much until I went back and ordered 4 more packs.
"
Brittany,3.0,2021 8 August,"
The product dose work.  When I light the sticks up I normally do two or three.  They don’t cover very much space.  And don’t last as long as I had hoped for.  There must be a better alternative.
"
Amy S.,1.0,2022 30 June,"
I have bought product of this nature in the past that worked super well. This is nothing more then incense and provides the bugs with a nice ambience as they feast on you. This is your warning stay away from these they don't work.
"
L. Diaz,5.0,2022 17 July,"
I was skeptical at first, but these actually work. I get huge, swollen reactions to mosquito bites so I tried to avoid them at all costs. I light these up in my back yard so I can enjoy being outside and they actually keep the mosquitoes away. I’m not sure exactly how long it lasts after the incense goes out but these give me at least a few hours mosquito free at a time during each use.

Erica ,5.0,2022 26 August,"
They were easy to stick up out of the ground around our camp site. Wish they lasted a little longer. But I believe they did the trick I used about 7 around our campsite each time they ran out I set up more.

Tonia P,5.0,2022 16 June,"
The scent is better than expected. Smell great! And keeps mosquitoes away! Love it.
"
Nicky Nicole Gets It Sold,5.0,2022 8 June,"
These incense work as advertised. I like them.
"
Melanie Howie,5.0,2022 31 May,"
I didn't think these would work but figured it couldn't hurt to try. All I know is that I get bit like crazy without them and I don't get bit at all with them. There's a mosquito nest in my neighbor's yard (I still have bite scars all over from last summer) so I'm convinced these are actual magic in a stick. I've tried so many things but these actually work, I've reordered them several times now, they're officially a necessity.
"
SEMTsensei,5.0,2022 21 July,"
Love the scent, easy to stick into the ground, unobtrusive and subtle.
"
Taylor,5.0,2022 19 April,"
They work great, I plan to buy more, the only downfall is you have to use 3-4 at a time AND they only last around 45mins to an hour. So for my active family, I will be making an alternative in addition to this.

Keeps the mosquitoes away

My daughter had gotten some, they worked so well I ordered for my house.
"
Princess Kauzlarich,4.0,2021 4 October,"
Not an over powering smell like regular mosquito repellents and they work!!
"
Jennifer Buffa,5.0,2021 16 September,"
they have a pleasant scent and seem to work for Me....my husband did get 1 bite but who know when he got itbut I like them
"
db,5.0,2022 20 October,"
I’m glad I didn’t listen to the bad reviews . Needed to try something so I bought them and these things work !!! I use them in my workshop and on the porch no more bites .
"
DBTA,5.0,2021 12 August,"
I was happily surprised by the efficacy of this product. I absolutely hate wearing bug spray so i went on the hunt to find an alternative. And boy did i hit the jackpot! Just light it and stick it in a flower pot or anywhere you want. In thrilled. I highly recommend this to everyone I know.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 27 November,"
Nothing really burned faster then stated but did the job

Easy to light and use, helps with our skeeter problem
"
Meri,5.0,2022 17 August,"
I didn’t know citronella incense sticks even existed, until I went down some Amazon rabbit hole! Not only, are they right up my alley, but they truly work! I just bought my second box! I typically get eaten alive, but love sitting outside. It’s really buggy, especially when it’s muggy here, despite that I live in Brooklyn! The scent isn’t too irritating either!
"
Herons,5.0,2022 16 July,"
It may not kill insects, but approx 12 hours after burning a stick in the garage I found a nasty palmetto bug lying on his back waiting for an exterminator!
"
Pinklady,5.0,2021 31 May,"
Easy to use.  Very pleased.  The scent is amazing.  They burn well too.
"
Lisa Carmody,5.0,2021 7 July,"
Work great for keeping mosquitos off the deck. Smells fantastic. I like that the stems are skinny so they fit in an incense holder, unlike some other brands that are too thick.
"
Inger,5.0,2021 3 October,"
Works well, and you don’t have to worry about a flame blowing out.

Hammad,5.0,2022 27 July,"
i tried alot of things, no more mosquitoes. i took this to Pakistan since there were a lot of flys. just to check if it will work on flys and omg! no flies no mosquitoes this is amazing. and i only put on one and the entire radius was mosquito and fly free. amazing product will buy forever
"
JOSE MANUEL ORTIZ,5.0,2021 13 September,"
It is excellent to repel mosquitoes at night
"
John R. Boyett,5.0,2021 7 October,"
They work great. I use them in a warehouse setting with a big mosquito population. These sticks keep them at bay. They burn long and smell great. I'm on my fourth box.  They'd be great for backpacking and camping also.
"
Deedrah,1.0,2021 26 July,"
They don’t work, at all

Runs a little faster than usual. Scent is too strong.
"
Cynthia ,5.0,2022 15 June,"
Life savers when camping.. the mosquitos and bugs were everywhere, and they all disappeared within a couple minutes of using the incense… we lit up 3 around the area and they lasted about 45 minutes..  the scent was not bad, it definitely smelled like bug repellent but it wasn’t unbearable.. 10/10 recommend
"
Fermin,5.0,2021 28 October,"
Work's great
"
Kristen Green,4.0,2021 16 July,"
Smells great, burns for about 30-45 min, depending on wind.Now, does it keep the bugs away? Not really. But it definitely helps. My friend is a mosquito magnet, and she said she noticed a difference as she ""only got bit 2 times VS the 8+ infinity, she is used to"" when we hang on the back porch.
"
Daisy,5.0,2021 18 August,"
Easy to lite
"
Cher56,5.0,2021 5 September,"
I hang them by my front door. I use two at a time during bad mosquito season. It keeps them away from my door. Good smell.
"
HANDLE LESS ,5.0,2022 20 June,"
Incense are thin hoping they were bigger and longer like ones I got from $tree
"
Amazon Customer,2.0,2022 21 June,"
I've had these for over a month. I cannot swear by these because there is no proof that they work indoor or outdoor. I have tried both and I still get bit by mosquitos. I have to light regular citronella and these for the best effect. These Florida insects don't care about these chemicals! To seem effective you'd need at least 20 burning at one time and that just doesn't make sense to do unless it's for a one day event.
"
Juan M. Hernandez,5.0,2021 10 October,"
Great scent, works too.
"

it really works and the smell its good but i can be qualm for a long time for me, but the mosquitos go away

These actually work when you place them in several locations around the patio or where you are visiting.

Justina,5.0,2022 16 July,"
Seems to work best with couple at a time surrounding the area, I definitely see a difference in how much I’m bitten by mosquitos and scent is not too strong or unpleasant.

Thank you - always looking for something that is not as strong and almost toxic than the citronella candles - this is great incense
"
"mwgilbert, az",5.0,2021 8 November,"
These are WONDERFUL!  Have had so much trouble with mosquitos on our front porch and in our yard. Used these on Halloween for the first time and they worked perfectly. The smell is really soft and pleasant and not a mosquito in sight!  Such a simple solution. I’ll definitely be buying more.
"
Hedieh,5.0,2021 18 July,"
I will get more, real lemongrass

"
Pat O,5.0,2021 22 October,"
We have a very heavy mini mosquito problem here. These seem to do the trick when I use them next to my night stand. I haven't woken up with more than two bites in the last several nights. Usually I will have six or seven.
"
Lay S.,5.0,2022 7 July,"
So far so good...kept mosquitoes away from me!  Will buy again.
"
Shannon D,4.0,2022 3 August,"
These sandals are everything you expect from Reef. Really comfortable, no ridged edges, superior arch support. But maybe they really are meant to be worn just in the sand.... They have zero traction. Wood, vinyl, tile floors etc are an adventure. The flip flops are nice enough looking to wear to my office on Fridays, but let's just say I wore them there once and won't again. Welp!!
"
Gertrude Nichols,5.0,2022 6 October,"

Clearly high quality but very uncomfortable between my toes. Returned.
"
Stone Pony,5.0,2022 27 August,"
I like these because they’re very comfortable and can go with many type of outfits. The woven Gibson a little bit dressier Feil and then the Reef label lends a more casual flair They are very comfortable! I also got them on sale so another big plus.
"
Madelyn Wray,5.0,2022 25 August,"
These Reef flip-flops are super comfortable and will mold to your feet. Nice quality and very durable for the beach or just a lot of walking. I have plantar fasciitis, and I find that these particular thongs don’t irritate my feet. They’re worth every penny.
"
Sue McCue,4.0,2022 20 July,"
Pretty, but no good support, I can only where for a few hours.
"
JAMES FRIERSON,4.0,2022 16 June,"
I like the flip flops. I like the support. After reading the reviews I ordered one size larger and they fit perfectly. I ordered white but they are more of a natural color. They are not stretchy at all.  I hope they stretch out a little.
"
Diana Frye ,4.0,2022 12 April,"
I read a lot of complaints and I read between the lines. I’ve had Reef flip flops before and I had to order one size up. Same with this pair. They are very comfortable and the arch hits me in the right spot. One person complained that these are slippery and that is the case. I don’t wear these in the house, so it’s not an issue for me but even after wearing them outside for a couple of months, they are still slippery on the rare occasions that I wore them in the house. Which is why I gave these 4 stars
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 26 August,"
These are my favorite flip flop and they are so comfortable. My last pair last me 3 years so they are definitely worth the money!
"
Travelingrn,5.0,2022 31 July,"
I wear these shoes basically every day. I have been exceedingly pleased with their durability and continued comfort. The foot bed has molded to my feet (I have very high arches), and the straps have remained sturdy without unraveling. I have worn these around the house, yard while gardening, walking outside in water, streams, while 4 wheeling, while fishing, while jet skiing, etc etc. they. Are. Awesome.
"
S. Hobson,4.0,2022 19 May,"
I was sad to have to return these. They were well cushioned and had great arch support but run really small. I'm usually between a 9.5-10 so I sized up and ordered a 10. My heels were hanging over the sandal... Disappointing.
"
Lisa M,4.0,2022 24 May,"
I wear a size 10 and have a regular width. These could’ve been a half size larger and a tad wider. Other than that they’re comfy like all other Reef flip flops I’ve owned.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2022 8 June,"
Shoe runs small, I’m a true 9 and had to reorder a size 10. Shoe feels great, very comfy

Comfy, and easy to walk around in. My feet normally hate me because I walk until they hurt, but these REEF flip flops are awesome.

Monica W.,3.0,2022 31 August,"
Ordered size 9 and were too small. I gave them to my daughter instead, she wears size 8 and they fit her perfectly. She loves them, they're very comfy and light.
"
E. Sliwinski,5.0,2022 18 July,"
These are my go to summer flip flops. Cushioned sole is very comfortable, starts to mold to your foot after a few wearings. Wider band keeps your foot in place and doesn’t irritate my skin. I wear them a lot and they lose their cushion after a season so I replace the next year
"
alexis,5.0,2022 6 August,"
My husband was always telling me that Reef flip flops are great so I had to try them. For $20 they are great. Comfortable and not slippery to walk in.

"
Savana Byrne,3.0,2022 4 May,"
I'm 7 months pregnant and have naturally wide and flat feet. I usually wear a 7.5-8 wide. My last 3 pregnancies, I purchased size 8.5 wide or 9 regular shoes to help with swelling in the summer, so I purchased these in a 9.For one, they're the perfect length, so definitely go up 1-1.5 sized when purchasing these.For two, they're very narrow, and my pinki toes sit on the very edge, almost falling over. So if you have wide feet, maybe go up 1.5-2 sizes.For three, the straps are rough, and very tight. I included a picture of what my foot looked like after 1 hour on my feet. I could feel them scratching with evert step.BUT the support is super nice, and I'm going to try to wear them a few hours a day for the next week to see if they losen up. If not, I'll put them away till after baby.
"
Kandice Henry,4.0,2022 5 May,"
Narrow and run a little small. I think they may stretch out so I’m going to keep them…but probably wouldn’t buy again

They fit true to size. Are extremely comfortable and stylish. These are my favorite brand of flip flops and the price was excellent! Definitely a great buy!
"
Diane F.,3.0,2022 23 July,"
I was extremely disappointed. According to the description these flip flops had arch support. If it’s there, I can’t feel it. Not worth the money I paid for them. They feel like I’m walking on a cheap piece of rubber when they’re on. And they’re extremely difficult to put on. Sorry I didn’t return them.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2022 19 May,"
very comfortable
"
Andrea Beltran,5.0,2022 24 June,"
I have these in white and I’ve had them for 4 plus years! Ordered in black and they’re still the same! Reef…don’t change a thing on these!!! Comfy, Cushiony & Supportive! If they had them in more colors, I’d buy them too! ❤️
"
Scifichic,3.0,2022 27 July,"
I nearly fall pretty much every time I wear these.. inside, outside.. doesn’t matter. The bottom of these flip flops are so smooth it’s such a hazard!!
"
Denean,3.0,2022 28 July,"
I buy reef flipFlops all the time and this pair I received seems cut really small the strap cut into my arch of foot
"
Kristin K.,3.0,2022 18 July,"
Great flip flop and super comfy.  But I ordered a size five, and while packaging said size 5 one shoe is a 6 and one shoe is a 7.  Not happy.
"
Tiffany,3.0,2022 20 March,"
I ordered these because the ones I bought brand new from a yard sale 2 years ago were wearing down. I wear them nonstop so they have been put through the ringer including getting wet multiple times. When I received these the label on the package said it was from the returns dept. But I thought no biggie because they were brand new looking. They are just as comfortable as my old ones but the sole on the bottom Is so slick that I've almost fell several times.  My other ones never had that problem and they are so worn you can't even see the imprint anymore. I wish I knew why this was a problem because I love these shoes.
"
TGarcia,3.0,2022 1 July,"
Love the shoe itself... comfortable right out of the box... problem is on right foot the front end keeps flipping under my foot while walking... has caused me to stumble several times and now has a split in the footbed...
"
Amanda Greif,5.0,2022 17 May,"
These give great arch support for a flip flop! If I don't have proper support, my back hurts when walking or standing. My back does not hurt in these! After reading reviews, I sized up one and I'm glad I did. There is no way my normal size would have fit!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 15 June,"
I have been dealing with foot problems for months and only been able to wear Brooks running shoes.  I needed a soft and supportive flip flop and these are great!
"
RaeAnn Calce,5.0,2022 30 April,"
I get myself a new pair every season because I wear them literally all the time. Plus my lab and wolf are fond of them as well. Love the support super comfy and they stay like that for a long time. I always have to order a size up but other than that they're perfect.
"
M Hill,5.0,2022 26 June,"
Really like the comfort of these!  I did size up from an 8 to a 9 and was glad I did.

"
Amanda S. ,2.0,2022 29 July,"
I absolutely fell in love with these. The look, support, comfort. They are my favorite flip flops. They were exactly what I was looking for. Have never made my feet sore. I've had a pair of Reefs flip flops for about 4/5 years and they are still in pretty good condition. These unfortunately are breaking down SO fast. I only wear them 2 or 3 days out of the week. I got them about a month ago. The strap has loosened more than I expected too. And I'm only 110 lbs. I had high hopes. I don't review items until I actually know what the product is like. I really hope these last the rest of the summer.
"
Lisa S.,5.0,2022 26 April,"
I have been wearing these sandals for over 10 years.  I buy 2 pair at a time (especially when they are at a good price!)  I certainly hope they don't stop making this particular style.  LOVE THEM!  LOVE REEF!
"
Meg,3.0,2022 19 March,"
These are comfortable shoes but unfortunately run small. I usually wear a 6-6 1/2 so I originally ordered a 6. They were a little tight. But no big deal I’ll exchange them. I had to order a 7 because they don’t have 1/2 sizes and they’re too tight as well. Not so much that I can’t wear them but still… I have really small feet and if these weren’t labeled as a size 7 I’d honestly swear they were the same size 6 I ordered the first time.
"
Dustin King,5.0,2022 8 June,"
I love these but definitely upsize x2. I wear a seven. I ordered an eight. Now wishing I would have ordered a nine.
"
SGard,5.0,2022 19 June,"
Perfect fit with a little support.  Super comfortable and holding up well to daily wear.
"
dimples,3.0,2022 10 May,"
The bottoms are like nylon on outer sole and I slip all the time. Quit wearing them. Paid a lot, didn't notice since I am usually on carpet or cement. Forget wood or tile floors.
"
Suzanne,5.0,2022 27 June,"
Comfortable and lightweight.
"
DENA MARIA,5.0,2022 12 March,"
Super cute, super comfortable. Walked 2+ miles the first day in them. Not sure how stretchy they are, as they are new. Honestly I do not want them to stretch at all. I am a size 9, bought the 9. They are a true fit.
"
Bee,3.0,2022 26 May,"
They are comfy.  Just wish they wouldn’t leave my feet black. None of my others do that.
"
Jon Purple,2.0,2022 10 September,"
Bought these for my wife, she loved them! But with normal wear the sole began separating from the sandal!! Very disappointing, at the price I expected so much more. Have loved other reef flip flops for me and my wife, but avoid these!!
"
Angela M. Ash,5.0,2022 27 April,"
I love these sandals but WARNING do not wear in the sand! The sand got caught in the mesh and chewed up my feet. 😟
"
Jeanie Stewart,3.0,2022 14 April,"
I usually wear a 7 1/2 in most shoes. But I bought in a nine just because I have never bought this brand before. Glad I did because they are almost too small.
"
NIkNik,3.0,2022 10 March,"
Well.. The footbed of them are comfortable, but one sandal is not braided right, it’s extremely tight and it digs in between my toe.. I’ve tried to stretch it, but no luck. I’m bummed cause I was going to order a second pair if they were comfy..
"
kerr,2.0,2022 19 September,"
The item was too small for me. I had to return it. However, the item seemed comfortable and it came as discretion. Unfortunately it was a bit too small for me.
"
Sam,3.0,2022 7 June,"
Too small
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2022 8 April,"
The fit is tighter than reefs I’ve had before, but once on they’re comfortable. They’re dangerously slick on hardwoods though. If I hadn’t worn them already they’d be going back.
"
nicole olivelli,3.0,2022 28 May,"
Runs small
"
Whitney Rahfeldt Schneider ,4.0,2021 6 September,"
I’ve ordered these a few times, but this time they came in smaller then normal. (I usually just click re order, hence knowing it’s not an order issue) however, they still mostly fit.
"
Kelly Byrne,5.0,2018 2 August,"
These have to be the softest, most comfortable flip flops I've ever owned. I had their Reef Zen Wonder sandal and LOVED them, but I think they discontinued them because you can't find them in any size other than 6 anywhere on the interwebs. So I did some research and came up with these as a substitute hoping they would be as comfortable as the Zen Wonders. WOW. It's like walking on pillows. They're fantastic. The only complaint I have is that they seem a little bit tight in the mesh strap area, but I'm sure that will loosen up over time wearing them. They're not uncomfortable tight, just tighter than I would have expected. I don't know if they make a wide in this shoe, but if your feet run wide, I would look into that. My feet are not wide, and they felt super snug. But other than that, these are heavenly to walk in. And while I have another pair of Reef sandals, the Sandy Sandal, that are very slippery inside on our slate floors, the Cushion Threads are just fine and do not slip at all. I saw another review noting how slippery they are and I haven't found that to be the case with these (as it is the case with the Sandy Sandals). Get them. You won't regret it!

"
Leslie,5.0,2022 15 May,"
Love them
"
E. Myers,4.0,2020 18 May,"
The o my flip flops I’ll buy are Reefs because of the arch support they give, but also because every pair I’ve owned has lasted for years at a time. I have a some what wide foot so I always have to go up a size when purchasing a pair. I typically wear an 8, but a 9 fits better. I do find though that these run small, so even if I didn’t have a slightly wide foot, I would still need to go up a size.Once you wear them a couple times and break them in, they’re very comfortable.
"
Lacey S.,2.0,2022 27 July,"
I have almost fallen several times! Had I not worn them outside already, I would have returned them. The rubber on the bottom is covered with some kind of fabric, making it very slick on some surfaces.
"
Sara G,3.0,2022 23 April,"
Runs very narrow
"
Lindsay B,4.0,2020 21 July,"
These sandals have received a lot of wear and tear from me, but they are still holding strong. I took down one star because they are not great when wet and get water logged and then take a long time to dry. I don't know about you, but when I'm wearing flip flops they are more than likely going to get wet at some point. They are still comfy and great for wearing around the house, but forget it if you want to water plants or go to the pool.
"
Nikki Breland,5.0,2020 24 July,"
I would add a picture, but my adorable puppy ate them already.. and I’m going to have to order another pair! I loved these flip flops. They were so comfy. I have 9.5 feet. The 9’s fit great. I always get 9’s in Reef and have never had an issue. They have just the right amount of room around the foot for support and my very long toes don’t go over the edge. 10’s leave too much room in the back! I have narrow feet, but also bunions. These felt very secure, not too tight. I thought the material would be stiff or loose, but it was perfect and very soft. Reef never disappoints!
"
Amy O,4.0,2020 2 May,"
These sandals are super cute but are a bit more narrow than other similar sandals I own. Typically I wear a size 9 but the size nine in this sandal has my toes barely fitting. I have normal size toes. 🤣 My only real concern is that there is no grip on the bottom. They are super slippery on my hard wood floors and at a grocery store it was difficult to keep my footing. I’m hoping after wearing them on sand and concrete they will work better.
"
Oceangrrrl,5.0,2020 16 July,"
I am a huge fan of the Reef Butters, but this is the second time I have been made aware that they aren’t available.  So I decided to give two different Reefs a try, and these are not only super cute, but they are extremely comfortable as well, especially compared to that other pair I had ordered.  The bands are very comfortable and securely hold my feet to the sole of the sandal.  I want these in another color!  They’re cute, nice enough to wear casual or out, and just surprisingly great overall!  Still not my Butters though.  ☹️Update.  I bought them in black too!!!
"
Jeri C.,5.0,2021 11 March,"
These sandals were just what I was looking for - they look like sandals from a few years back, which is exactly what I wanted.  The footbed is supportive, and the knit straps with the soft ribbon for in between the toes is perfect.  I think I am going to want other colors.  They definitely do not run large.  I always wear a size 6, but these could be just a bit larger than they are, though I'm sure they will stretch.

I think it runs a little small so as I got my granddaughter one size up. She loves it. The color is beautiful.
"
Lee,5.0,2021 10 February,"
Attention: reef changed their logo. People need to do research. These are not fake. Goodness. That being said, if you are between sizes, size up to the next whole size. I am anywhere between a size 7-8 in sandals and I ordered a size 8. They fit great. They are very comfortable. I love the wide straps. They are cute basic flip flops and well made.

Love Love Love .... Good buy

Lori Reinhardt,5.0,2022 8 March,"
The fit and comfort are perfect.
"
Wendy Bauman,2.0,2022 5 June,"
I love Reefs.  Ive had the Gingers for years repeatedly.  BUT If you are looking for something with great traction, these are NOT it.  They are fine outside, but I slide all over my tile floors.
"
Cammy,4.0,2020 8 May,"
I have always loved Reed flip flops and I have always wore a size 9 in any reefs and that has always fit perfectly but these run a 1/2 size smaller, the sole fits like a size 9 but the straps fit like a size 8 1/2, very snug and does not lessen after wearing at all,but they still are a very nice well built flop.
"
Rashel ,4.0,2021 9 February,"
The white is not really white. More like a dingy off white. My flops look like they are dirty when they are clean and new. Otherwise they are great but I wouldn’t buy them again
"
MAS,1.0,2022 23 October,"
These flip flops have no tread - they slide. You will slip and fall. No question. They have a sole that immediately fails: on wood floors, stairs, grass, stone wall ways. A very poor design. Be ready.
"
Mindi,4.0,2020 11 August,"
I love Reef sandals and thought these were so cute! They’re pretty comfortable however the tread on the bottom is weird. It looks like good traction but it’s actually kinda slick. I slip when walking in my house all the time. Hoping with wear outside and on concrete they’ll get better....
"
Blaire,4.0,2020 20 May,"
The reviews are true that these are narrow sandals with a high arch. If u don’t have high arches, it will be painful. But they are thick and squishy and amazing, which is why I took a pair of scissors to the squish and shaved them down so the arch wasn’t killing my feet. Totally worth it. LOL!
"
Melissa Nicol,5.0,2020 15 September,"
Definitely different than previous reefs I have owned but still very comfortable and stylish. Reefs are my absolute favorite flip flops hands down. The footbed is smoother and softer and the reef logo changed so it seems like they may be fakes at first but after doing some research it looks like Reef changed their logo? Still not sure but they have been great so far! Do run a little small and need to stretch a little
"
Elizabeth Norris,4.0,2020 17 June,"
Ordered these for my best friends birthday.  Disappointed that i ordered them on a Friday and recovered them the following Wednesday with prime.  Women’s reefs run a tad bit small so i sized up and they fit her perfectly. She wears an 8 and i got her a 9.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2020 19 June,"
I was very pleased with these discounted Reefs.  Yes, I believe they really are legit Reefs, but I suggest ordering a 1/2 to a whole size up. I always wear a size 8 and the are almost too short for comfort, but I will keep them for the price.
"
KMharford,4.0,2020 22 May,"
The length was okay, but they were a bit tight across the strap. The strap rubs right under my arches. Kept them hoping they will break in.  However, they are slippery.  I've been using sandpaper on the sole to try to get a grip. Not worth the $42 price range.
"
Genn,4.0,2020 9 June,"
These are extremely comfortable.  Not the support I was looking for.  My biggest issue is they are slippery on floors.  I have tried everything to scratch up the bottom of the shoe.  Having problem with my platner fastest makes walking around the house a little uneasy.
"
Sonnet Chase,4.0,2020 8 July,"
Cute sandals and the fit and comfort are good, the only reason I gave them a 4 instead of 5 star is because they are a bit slippery on some surfaces.  A few times I have almost fell on my booty when walking on certain surfaces.
"
ELF,3.0,2020 12 May,"
I have worn reef flip flops for years and love them.  These look really nice but there are two small issues with them.  They run VERY narrow. Luckily I have pretty narrow feet but the blue yarn hits the bottom of my feet not to the side which makes them a little less comfortable.  Second issue is that the bottom of the shoes are very slippery on most surfaces (none of my other Reefs are.)  I have tried to scuff them to make them less so, but have almost slipped a few times when they didn't catch on the floor.  I'll keep them but wouldn't likely choose them had I known these issues.
"
Briggs,5.0,2020 20 May,"
Every year I get a new pair of Reef sandals.  I’ve never had a pair wear out, I just like to get a new style each summer.  These are by far my favorite Reef’s!  The style caught my eye immediately...they are clean looking, cute and will match many different outfits.  What I was not expecting, however, was how comfortable they are.  The cushioning on bottom is wonderful.  I can’t wait to wear them...after I get a long overdue pedicure!
"
Sound traveller,5.0,2021 21 October,"
Love these they don’t show dirt on the foot pad and super soft great fit! Had a pair that I needed to replace.
"
HollyA,4.0,2020 13 August,"
Comfortable and nice looking. Not for wide feet but good fit otherwise. The bottom is slippery which i found surprising. I was even slipping on a dry, wooden boardwalk in NJ. This is the reason for 4 not 5 stars.
"
jas7273,5.0,2021 3 November,"
So much better than thin strap flip-flops.  I now have 2 pair - black and tan weave
"
Janie,5.0,2021 15 June,"
Love these, they are so comfortable. Sole is so soft. There is arch support also.  I wear a 6.5 so I ordered the 7.  It fits perfectly.  You may want to size up and it may run slightly narrow.
"
Joseph,5.0,2020 28 November,"
Very comfortable, cushiony flips.  Runs small so order up! Look at size chart and measure your feet.  A word of caution to those who are accident prone, they are strangely slippery on smooth floor surfaces.  They've held up well through one summer so far.  When they do wear out I'll definitely buy them again.
"
L H.,4.0,2020 29 July,"
Nice looking and very comfortable, but narrow.  I wear a medium width and these fit my feet exactly., no room to spare. So if you like your fit a little loose, be prepared for a narrow fit.
"
KTH,5.0,2021 10 October,"
So comfortable and affordable this time. Reef are my favorite flip flops and I am really happy with this purchase.
"
Hannah,5.0,2020 9 June,"
So these shoes are very narrow which I have size 11 narrow feet so they fit me perfectly. These shoes definitely need a break in period, but afterwards they are so comfy. The part where the fabric for the strap goes in the shoe has a little hump and that hurt my footFor a while but after wearing them none stop for about a week they are great.
"
Ann,4.0,2017 18 July,"
The reef cushion threads are nice sandals . I am keeping them for looks . I prefer the sandy sandal the best. I found the tape in these sandals to be a bit more tight in the fit in both pair that I bought. However that said .., it is a good sandal to wear anywhere with a more sleek look. For all day hard wearing I'd still choose the sandy sandal. I am keeping the two pair I bought. I bought six pair of reefs and will be collecting more of the sandy sandals as they are my absolute favorite .
"
jennifer l gasner,4.0,2020 3 August,"
Like walking on a cloud. I love the thickness of the straps, they cover the areas of my foot like my baby toe - the dreaded not so picturesque toe. I bought the cream color.
"
C. E. Parah,2.0,2022 13 April,"
These reef flip flops are not like any of my other reefs, I could barely get my foot in them they are so narrow. If you have a narrow foot they will probably work for you.
"
omi,5.0,2021 23 April,"
This is my second pair of this exact kind of shoes although my first ones for pot in my second ones with what I have found that the black pair seem to rub black off on math feet
"
Nicole Putnam,3.0,2021 26 June,"
Has great support but the top is very small. Makes it hard to wear. I’m sure if i wore them more they would have stretched but i didn’t have the patience after lightly wearing them for half a day.
"
Jaypaps,3.0,2020 16 October,"
The sole of this sandal needs to be re-engineered.  You can slip and slide on almost any surface very easily, I almost fell a few times.  When I wear these indoors I have to shuffle instead of step, that's how slippery they are.  Also the sole is too mushy, and not firm enough.  Other than that they are comfortable and fit well, true to size.
"
Audra Salisbury ,5.0,2021 1 June,"
Sadly we had to return them. They are too small to go over my step daughters feet. She is only 10 and the size 5 we a little long but still too tight.
"
Mair K,4.0,2020 8 June,"
Cannot give a great review because they did not fit my feet. Fortunately, I’m able to give them to my daughter.Ordered a size larger for myself Hopefully they will fit.
"
Ryan Murphy,2.0,2022 23 May,"
Not true to size. I am not impressed with these and I like Reefs.
"
Wendy One,5.0,2020 3 June,"
My foot runs a little wide so it's hard to find shoes in general. I have been loyal to the nike cushioned flip flops but they got expensive and I heard they downgraded the quality. I'm so happy with these. They are comfortable and I like how they look! I hope they hold up for a few summers.
"
B Jett,2.0,2022 3 June,"
Great shoe, but leaving a blister weeks later.
"
Tia,1.0,2019 5 October,"
I’m so bummed out. For the last 5 years, Reefs are the only flip flops I’ve worn. I love how comfy they are and how long they last. I recently spent 1 month traveling Southeast Asia and spent the majority of my time wearing a year-old pair of Reef flip flops. I was so impressed with how well they traveled.I got back to the US and ordered this pair of flip flops in size 7, the same size that I’ve worn for YEARS from this brand. When it arrived, I was surprised that my heel was hanging off the end of the flip flop and that my very narrow feet seemed to be spilling over the sides of the flip flops. I read some reviews which mentioned that Reef sizing had gotten jacked up so I returned the flip flops and ordered a size 8. Now the size 8 have come in and there is about an inch of flip flop off the back of my heel. Or course they don’t make half sizes or I would have obviously ordered a 7.5.I’m just really bummed out that they have changed the sizing. I love this brand and sincerely hope that they go back to the sizing they used before or at least offer half sizing as well. I want to continue to wear Reefs but unfortunately will be returning this pair and won’t be trying to buy any flip flops from them anytime soon.
"
steph,5.0,2020 15 April,"
I love these flip flops. They are super comfy and cute as well.  My dog ate my first pair that I only had for two weeks, so I ordered another one. I was still wearing the first pair as it was still wearable but I wanted another one. As far as I can see, they are very durable as well.
"
Katherine Accomando,5.0,2017 1 July,"
Got 7 years out of my last reefs - looking for another 7 with these bad larrys.Wicked cute flip flops!! I had my last pair of reefs for 7 years and they finally wore out right before a week at the beach- thank goodness for prime shipping! These new reefs have a very comfy, sturdy sandal strap and supportive soles. I love them and the size 9 fits my 8.5/9 feet great. We'll worth spending a little extra bling bling for the quality!!!PS the photo is my bf's janky feet next to my flip flops. Swear I don't got hobbit feet!
"
jeanne,4.0,2020 12 September,"
Good foam bottom,  slippery when wet. And also runs a bit longer then normal on toe and heel.
"
caroline furtado,2.0,2022 27 May,"
Size up and the quality is cheep... very disappointed
"
Sonia Mohammed,4.0,2021 21 January,"
The straps are a bit snug
"
Gail Fox,5.0,2021 8 May,"
I live in my Reefs, summer and winter. Some pairs lose the strap from the sole of the shoe but on this one so far so good.
"
PB in SB,5.0,2020 16 May,"
Love these! They truly *fit* my foot. No falling off between steps. Love how the wide strap sits back farther on my instep, which holds the cushy sole in place much better than a typical flip flop. I can see how this style is better suited to a narrower, lower volume foot like mine.
"
signangel,3.0,2021 27 May,"
I have wide feet right below the base of my pinky toe and these sandals looked ridiculous because they're too narrow for me (my foot hangs off the side). However;  they are comfortable.
"
Mark Barilla,2.0,2021 1 April,"
After looking at so many options, I decided to get these. My old pair was Reef brand and I loved them. They finally broke (after wearing them nearly daily for several years). Naturally, I wanted to get another pair. When they arrived, I found them way too narrow. I could not even get my foot halfway into the flip. I don't think that I have ""fat feet"" so I let my daughters try and they couldn't get them on either. I finally shoved my feet in.  Also, they're so slippery--no grip on the bottom at all.  So disappointing. I'll need to return these and try another style.
"
jcbaxter,5.0,2021 26 April,"
I have a narrow foot.  Hard to find flip flops that stay on and aren’t too wide.  These fit me perfectly.  Snug fit and comfortable!
"
Tesla,5.0,2021 22 September,"
These are my favorite sandals. They are so comfortable.
"
LW,3.0,2020 18 June,"
Though cute and comfy, these suckers run really small. Normally I wear a 9, so I ordered a 10 and they were so small I don’t think an 11 would be big enough. I don’t have a skinny foot, but not fat either and I’ve never in my life have worn a wide size, but this is designed for a very thin foot as well.
"
AmyW,5.0,2021 1 April,"
Perfect fit, excellent quality. The arches are perfect and this is a true Reef sandal. Fast shipping, hassle free! Will be doing business with this seller again.
"
jrowan13,5.0,2020 29 June,"
Love these they’re so cute and comfy, if you are in between sizes order the size up (I’m an 8-8.5 and the 9 is what fits). They are a bit slippery on the bottom but I think when they get worn more they’ll build up some traction.
"
Akire,4.0,2019 28 July,"
They are beautiful and feel comfortable, BUT they are narrow and they are not true size. They feel too tight and I forgave wide feet. Also, the back of my feet’s are out a little bit. I returned them to get a bigger size.
"
SkyeAlysa,3.0,2017 2 December,"
This sandal is not appropriate for people with wide feet and it badly proportioned in this way.  The sole and straps are very narrow, and once you order a size large enough to accommodate a wider foot, you end up with an awkward extra length in the toe that become cumbersome.  I am always catching the toe of the sandal on the floor wrong and it causes me to trip frequently.However it is a very comfortable shoe, and i am very pleased with its sturdy construction.  The sole is especially springy.i initially bought this shoe in a size 10 and exchanged it for an 11.
"

Tracy Goforth,5.0,2020 18 August,"
These sandals will fit super tight but once they are stretched out, they are super comfy.  They are my to go to sandals for everyday wear.  I got them for a great deal as well.  Worth the money!
"
mcr,5.0,2020 2 July,"
I LOVE the comfort of these flip flops!!! They are so soft and super comfortable. I am usually a size ten and ordered a size 11 and fit perfect. If you are ordering I would order a size larger then what you usually get.
"
Erin Heider,5.0,2021 26 August,"
Soft, yet supportive. My favorite flip flop of summer 2021!

Valerie Haack,4.0,2020 24 June,"
The shoe is very comfortable but seems narrow and they don't offer this in a wide.
"
home6,5.0,2021 19 January,"
Great flips!  Like walking on memory foam.  The straps are nice adding a little extra detail to a simple flip flop. Bought more in yellow and cream.
"
Deb B,5.0,2020 4 August,"
I saw these sandals on a friend and had to have them.  They are beautiful and fit well too.  I love how comfortable the sole is and the macrame look of the top is just the right touch.
"
Carolyn judge,5.0,2017 29 September,"
I LOVE Reef flip flops. I have a pair I purchased 12 years ago. I have worn them EVERYDAY of the summer for the past 12 years. The only reason I purchased another pair was to finally have 2 pairs. The first pair that I purchased 12 years ago are still in great shape. They mold to your feet and are the most comfortable thing in the world. Everyone should have at least one pair in their collection and I promise you the will be the only pair you grab and wear!!
"
MJB,5.0,2021 5 June,"
They are sandals. Not much support but I didn't buy them for support. I love ""REEF"" sandals.
"
J. Royal,1.0,2022 17 February,"
Was looking for a pair of flip flops to throw on and wear around our pool.  I'm glad I only paid $9 for these b/c they are terrible.  Firstly, they fit really tightly and almost squeeze the top of my foot.  I don't have this problem with other sandals.  Secondly, they are very slippery.  Even walking on wood and tile floors, my feet slip.  Lastly, the arch sits too far back for my foot.  I can't wear Nikes for the same reason - the arch hits my foot too far back so if you have the same problem with Nikes, don't buy these flip flops.
"
Joylenn,1.0,2022 15 August,"
I love the fit of my Reef flip flops but the are so slick to walk on nearly any surface.  This makes them difficult to wear.
"
jennifer,5.0,2020 24 February,"
Stylish and comfortable. I highly recommend these flip flops.  Reef normally runs a bit small so I am usually a size 8 and I wear a 9 in all of their shoes.  Wide band is very comfortable and supportive.  I will be ordering more in other colors now.
"
Audrey Rogers,5.0,2020 15 June,"
I like everything about these flip flops..they look exactly like the photograph. They are very comfortable..however I do feel $40 is a bit pricey for flip flops..I had a gift card and wanted casual shoes in that color so I bought them.
"
AmazinMom4,3.0,2020 24 April,"
So the foam is soft but where the strap hits the foam part it is really narrow and the strap is glued in weird, causing the foam to bump up and cut into the foot. I am hoping with some normal wear it will flatten out. They also have a very obnoxious chemical smell to them.
"
G. Holt,5.0,2020 18 May,"
Have only worn them once and they feel snug but not tight.  I have a wide foot so this is probably not the case for everyone.  I’m sure once they break in they will relax and feel looser(which I like).
"
Hillary,3.0,2021 15 April,"
These fit tight, and do not seem to be breaking in with wear. Hoping the strap becomes softer and more pliable with continued wear
"
A. Barrineau,5.0,2019 22 June,"
I love these!!!  I read the reviews and ordered a size up.  I kinda wish I hadn’t I think the 8 would be fine. The 9 is ok just they are getting looser in the straps as I wear them every day!!  So anyway super soft bottom. I’ve had the cushion before and I am a huge fan.  Very supportive.  Recommend 100%!
"
Michelle,5.0,2017 12 December,"
Reef flip flops with the cloth toe separator are the only flip flops I’ll wear. I always find I have to go down a full size for flip flops and up half a size for boots. So I am a consistent 9 and I always order an 8 in Reef. Also, they stretch out with wear and the sole gets a bit wider and longer as you wear them in, so I always go a size smaller for these reasons.
"
Moskwaka,3.0,2019 26 September,"
I love Reef sandals and have been wearing them for close to 20 years.  This is one of the first pairs that I've ever had that have been significantly too narrow.  Usually they fit like they were made for me but I wore these once and never put them back on.  The aqua color is adorable, just wouldn't recommend if you're used to wearing wider flip flops.
"
MomAmazon Customer,5.0,2021 9 September,"
Very comfortable and cute.
"
cherie,4.0,2019 4 September,"
I love the shoe but you may want to buy a half size bigger than you normally wear. They fit very tight. I still love them but next pair I’ll buy larger
"
Ann Marie Proud,1.0,2022 14 July,"
I Have a closet full of Reefs and have never experienced this before. The bottoms of these sandals were out after about a month of usage. They are very slippery now and won’t be wearing them.

Slippery but very cute. Wish they change the bottoms to grip better
"
Tara Bullock,4.0,2018 15 April,"
I have a narrow foot & wear a size 8. I originally ordered a different style (same brand) in a size 8 and they were way too small. I returned them & ordered these a size up (size 9) and they fit perfectly! Super comfy! I'm so relieved & I love them!
"
LaEspaniola,5.0,2020 15 July,"
I used to buy REEF flip flops when attending the university because here in Puerto Rico is always hot. I forgot how comfortable they are and the support. I love my new summer flip flops!
"
Melanie Mullins,5.0,2020 6 June,"
So comfortable.  I could see how they might be a little narrow for some but they fit me well.  I usually wear a 7 and the 7 fits perfect.  I love the thick, soft, straps.

LibertyBelle,5.0,2020 16 June,"
Great flip flops! Comfy and tons of support. However they do not fit true to size!! I am normally a 9, but these were more like an 8. I had to reorder them at the next size.

"
Tiffani,5.0,2020 17 March,"
OK I’m a little biased because I love Reefs. But, these have the cushion foam stuff, so they are really comfortable and soft to walk on. Just keep in mind that they’re not really white —they’re light khaki colored. I love them.
"
MandyHas,5.0,2020 7 July,"
I love these reef sandals, I was lucky to be able to get them while they were on sale. They are very supportive especially since I have plantar fasciitis. They are cute and comfortable.
"
 Maria A.,4.0,2019 21 March,"
I had to return them and purchased one size up.( Normally I am size 6, returned them, and got 7). Size 7 works great, they are super comfortable , but they stain your feet black. what a shame.
"
Tiffany Davis,4.0,2020 7 July,"
just sad I lost one. :(
"
Gia,3.0,2020 21 August,"
These are super comfy, but there is absolutely no grip on them. Very very slippery. I don't understand why there isn't some sort of gripping. If you walk on hard floors or in a restaurant with tile, you'll slip.
"
GirlMomma,1.0,2022 15 August,"
I have small narrow feet, I tried to put these on and couldn’t even get my feet into them.
"
WildTurkey,3.0,2020 21 April,"
The fit is a bit smaller than expected but will most likely stretch after wear. The bottom of the shoe provides NO grip whatsoever! I've slipped walking across my floors several times, be careful!!! Very slick, will be dangerous if wet surface or if you walk too fast!

Golf_Girl,5.0,2019 3 September,"
You can never go wrong with reef.  Solid flip flop - nice arch support, thick sole but very forgiving and they retain their shape.  These were a little tighter across the top of my foot but super cute and comfortable!  Reef flip flops are more expensive than others, but they're worth every penny!

"
Maggie,3.0,2020 18 June,"
I thought these sandals we’re SO cute and anxiously awaited their arrival! What a let down!! They are way too snug! The length was fine, it was the straps! I could barely get my foot into them! I sadly sent them back.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2020 14 July,"
Comfy and lightweight
"
Jamie,3.0,2020 6 July,"
I love these BUT they are super slippery. They have absolutely no traction. Being a new mom often walking around the house and on the deck with the baby in hand, I can’t risk wearing these. I slip every time.
"
Sara's Place,3.0,2020 16 May,"
Runs way too small. Order larger. I wear a size 9 and have narrow feet. I ordered a 9 but they were too narrow and ran short. I was SO disappointed! Very comfortable. Cute. Good support. Next time will order size 10 or 11.
"
Amber callicoatte,5.0,2020 4 May,"
My feet swell and I've just had a baby so the size was my fault. The material is great though. Wish they had it in size 9 right now. Gifting it to my small footed mother.
"
MLG,4.0,2018 1 May,"
I want to like these, but they do get squeaky and hot if you're wearing them over a long day or for a lot of walking. They are cute and otherwise pretty comfortable. But flip flops are noisy enough as it is without the squeak!
"
Beth,5.0,2020 18 June,"
I've bought these every year for the last 3 years. They fit great and are so comfortable for all day wear. I have issues with my arches, and they are VERY supportive!

Ordered size 5. Got them and tried on left shoe and it fit. It's finally warm enough to wear so I got them out and right shoe was very large. Turns out left she is a 5 and right shoe is a 7. Now return window is gone Would like an option to exchange for correct size.
"
Brittany Beshero,5.0,2021 14 July,"

"
Adriana Gomez,2.0,2020 9 May,"
The straps on these sandals are NOT the same size! I know that many people have one foot larger than the other, but I feel my feet are pretty much the same. I’ve never had an issue with other shoes. The Reef sandals are definitely tighter on the right sandal. I even tried the left sandal on my right foot (just in case my foot may have been swollen, for whatever reason) and the left strap doesn’t feel tight at all. I thought I’d wear these for a day- to see if the right strap would loosen, but they were so uncomfortable. I couldn’t take it. They’re going back.
"
svlorelei,3.0,2020 9 May,"
Not the usual Reef flops I’m used to but attractive. Bottoms are a strange material which is slick as in no traction. The straps are a bit loose but I have narrow feet. Good value for the money but not a fav.
"

Sandra K,3.0,2020 13 July,"
I purchased reef flip flops in past and they were fine.  This pair is very slippery on many smooth surfaces.  Not happy at all about this.  Hopefully, I won't slip and break something!
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2019 30 May,"
I had a pair of the reef cushion breeze which fit my feet perfectly and I wore until they wore out. I ordered the cushion threads to replace them. They were much more narrow and the straps were a tighter fit than the breezes (though I’m sure in time would have worn in fine). Returning because of the width and going back to purchase what I know.
"
Antoinette ,2.0,2021 17 July,"
Definitely not the real thing. I had a pair of the real reefs and they had great arch support and last probably about 2 yrs and I wear them all the time. This pair is already starting to show wear and tear. The arch support is not even close to the same. Don’t waste your money on these.
"
Delilah,5.0,2020 6 August,"
I love these, they are so comfortable. I am not normally one to buy flip flops with wider straps, but I got these and love them
"
Laura Ferrell,3.0,2020 30 May,"
I would like to love this flip flops, but I can’t. They are very comfortable, but the tread on the bottom is almost nonexistent. I will have to buy something to put in the bottom of these shoes.
"
beth,5.0,2020 22 June,"
I love reefs! My favorite brand of flip flops! This pair is no exception. Very comfortable. I love the support they provide in the arch. The fit is perfect.
"
Lisa Dupuis,5.0,2020 21 June,"
Love the color, the perfect fit, not tight, not loose. Love the arch support. I buy a new pair every year. Love these the best so far.
"
JT,2.0,2020 23 April,"
These are quite narrow and very slippery on the bottom. True to size as far as length. I wear an 8 and the 8 fit. My biggest complaint is the high arch. It feels like a ball under my foot and actually hurts. I would say my foot arch is normal. Not flat or high and I usually don’t have issues, but these are not at all comfortable for me. I do love the squishy feel of the shoe itself. I’m disappointed I will need to return these, but that’s the risk of buying online without being able to try on first.
"
Sarahizzle,4.0,2017 18 July,"
I wear an 8 1/2 so I had to get the size 9 and they fit like a size 9 would on an 8 1/2 foot. They are very cute and comfortable and have gotten a lot of compliments but the crochet straps are a lol loose.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 1 July,"
Recently took a trip to Florida. Perfect fit and hold their shape well. Adorable on the beach or with shorts.  Very comfortable to walk in.
"
joshua shae hatfield,5.0,2021 27 June,"
Fit great, comfy and super cute
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 27 February,"
Fits a little small so I would go 1/2 size up. Incredibly comfortable. Can’t wait to wear them on my cruise. I bought the off white but will be ordering the black pair soon.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 21 May,"
Love them even a year later
"
Robert Neely,5.0,2020 9 August,"
I bought these for my girlfriend. She loves them. They don't slip off your foot. She says they are ""cushion-y"". Very comfortable.
"
David Chavez,5.0,2020 24 August,"
My wife loved the sandals in the off white and brown, so I decided to get her the black ones too.
"
cynthia beam,3.0,2020 12 May,"
If you have wide feet, this shoe is not for you. I even ordered a size bigger and it still snug. The straps feel great and the shoe is soft and nice to walk in.
"
Heather L Griffin,5.0,2020 1 May,"
Ordered these for my Mom due to being home during Covid 19.......she loves them. Says the fit perfectly and have a nice cushion on the bottom. Made Mom smile!!!
"
Charly Perkins,5.0,2020 1 July,"
These are very pretty and very well made. They came in super fast and I am so excited to take them to the beach!
"
Molly32,5.0,2019 24 August,"
Very Cute and comfortable.  I have feet problems by I can were these for short amounts of time with no pain.  I were an 8 in everything but had to size up in these so my heel would not stick out from the sole.
"
SwellGuy,5.0,2020 23 June,"
These flip flops are the perfect summer footwear.  They go with all of my summer outfits, but also are fine in the sand.
"
Paige N.,4.0,2017 11 May,"
So comfortable! I love Reef and plan to wear these all summer.  My feet get swollen easily and these still fit even on a swollen foot day.  They were not too snug and on a normal foot they probably feel perfect.
"
Orenda friend,5.0,2020 18 May,"
Amazing flip flop tha get noticed every time I wear them. Comfortable, great fit, and easy to get in and out of. Just ordered the black
"
nvj3wlv,5.0,2019 26 June,"
Have been wearing Reefs for many years, way many.  Quality remains, price has increased as with everything else, considerably but ordered two pair, two colors.  Last thing I need is more shoes, BUT, so pretty, very nice.  Last forever.
"
CambMA,5.0,2020 7 July,"
Most comfortable pair of reefs I’ve ever owned, and I’ve had a lot! Love the wide soft strap and pretty coral color.
"
cassarl,4.0,2019 29 December,"
I love the comfort and look of these.
"

Una compra que valió la pena. Muy cómodas,  importante para el dolor que sentía con las comunes.
"
Phoebe,5.0,2020 25 September,"
Love this pair of sandals so much. Perfect for the beach or a day on the boat
"
Jackie,3.0,2018 3 April,"
I have had over 5 pairs of Reefs in the past and these are not one of my favorites due to the sole which is curved up in the front and back vs flat. My other cushion soles are not like this.  The strap is so soft and I needed them for a trip so I kept them and hopefully they flatten out with wear.
"
Huichun,1.0,2022 3 August,"
It's comfy until you start to notice it's very slippery.
"
Megan,5.0,2018 10 August,"
Reef cushion flip flops are the comfiest flip flops ever invented. I wore these all through out my pregnancy and they were the only thing i could get through the day wearing. The top on these is super soft. They break in to form to your feet and have great arch support.
"
R. D. Mackenzie,5.0,2019 7 May,"
This was a lot of money for me to spend on flip flops but they are SO comfortable. Padded, I feel like I am walking on a cloud. Soft material between my toes instead of rough leather or plastic. Heaven. Bought 2 pairs.
"
Judy ,5.0,2018 16 August,"
Oh my! The most comfortable flip flops I have ever worn. The arch support is wonderful. The cushion when you walk is so nice. The piece that hose between toes is nice and doesn't irritate. I haven't had them very long so time will tell if they will continue to be as cushioned.
"
Nanner,5.0,2020 3 August,"
Everything about these are great. I’ve eorb reefs for years !  Can also be altered by my orthodics.
"
Angela,4.0,2020 7 January,"

Tania Schellhorn,5.0,2021 9 May,"
Soo comfortable! Love these!
"
ChristinaD,3.0,2020 20 July,"
Love reefs but these didn't fit based on size chart. Ran very small. I like the strap but sizing needs adjusted.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 26 May,"
They are perfect
"
True Blue,5.0,2020 3 April,"
Happy with purchase. The coral straps are thicker than expected so it takes a little wiggling of the feet to slide foot completely forward
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 20 February,"
Comfortable & cloth braid helps the air flow. I usually wear 7 1/2 and got these in 7 and they're fine. Thought they might give some being braided
"
Briana Rischitelli,5.0,2020 14 July,"
Love this sandal! I have really bad feet and I can wear these all day! Wicked comfy and supportive.
"
Cynthia C,5.0,2021 11 April,"
Super comfy and cute
"
Cassie t,3.0,2020 2 June,"
These are SO narrow. I can usually put on any sandal and go but these are so much narrower than expected and make it uncomfortable.
"
I H,1.0,2022 19 August,
jeni,5.0,2017 9 August,"
Really comfortable and solid sandals, as expected from Reef. I buy a new pair of Reefs every year and put hundreds of miles on each one. These ones should also stand up well to this test. The straps are a bit thicker than some of the other models, but they're as equally comfortable and well-made as any other pair I've owned.
"
kirsten fitzgerald,1.0,2022 2 August,"
Such cute sandals but broke on first wearing
"
Sydnie Woolcock,5.0,2020 30 May,"
I normally do not like wearing flip flops, but these are so comfortable and soft I wear them all the time!
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2021 13 February,"
Not wide enough toes hang off
"
Jessica Green,2.0,2020 20 June,"
I love Reef flip flops, I have been wearing them for years. These just didn't pass through a decent quality control. They look lovely, and are very comfortable. However, each flip flop strap is very different. One strap fits loosely, the other fits very tight. Either would be fine, I know they eventually stretch out so the tight isn't a bother. But they are so different, that it just feels weird when I walk. It's quite annoying and frustrating.
"
Dani Oates,4.0,2017 7 August,"
These sandals are cute and comfy, but they are incredibly slippery as there seems to be no grip on the sole. I'm contemplating adding something to the bottom to avoid busting my butt.
"
Kristine B.,5.0,2020 1 December,"
My second pair of these, so comfy...even for fat feet ha!
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2020 16 February,"
Very comfortable,
"
Tricia Atkins,1.0,2022 9 March,"
I wear a size 7,5 normally in shoes sometimes even a 7 but I like a little room on sandals so always order an 8. This 8 feels like a 6 they are super tight, and my foot is hanging off the back. Will be requesting a return. They are comfortable though and good quality like with all reef products.
"
Bobbie Legare,5.0,2020 14 July,"
Love these sandals,  except they are a little tight. I'm hoping the straps will loosen a little.
"
Scott Gray,5.0,2020 22 June,"
I was very pleased on how comfortable they are , and are my go to flip flop now !
"
Jennifer,5.0,2018 17 July,"
Bought these to replace another older pair of Reefs that my dog chewed through. They're so comfortable and fit well. The difference in cushioning and comfort between these and other pairs of sandals is astounding. It's not even close. I'll buy Reefs for the rest of my life!
"
prime shopper man,5.0,2019 17 December,"
These are very comfy. All reef have support in there shoes. That is why i keep going back to them. I don't think there is a bad reef flip flip
"
Gracie Rivera,5.0,2020 16 June,"
I got these as a birthday present and I love them.  They are so comfortable, considering buying another.
"
Ashley Brown,5.0,2018 24 September,"
The last pair of these I had lasted me 13 years of almost daily wear. I tried a different brand after my original reef flip flops finally wore down. The other brand lasted 18months. So I'm back to my favorite and excited to have another pair!
"
Clorissa Tejeda,5.0,2019 8 July,"
Very comfortable!!! I'm normally a size 9 but I ordered a10 after trying on a pair of Reefs at sporting goods store. So I recommend ordering a size up from your normal shoe size. These are super cute sandals!
"
Ashley Dempsey,3.0,2020 18 June,"
The bottoms of these are very comfortable. Unfortunately they run small and are entirely way to narrow for my feet.
"
Kevin Nelson,5.0,2020 12 July,"
My wife loves them. She wears them all day at home. It's helping her flat feet pain.
"
Sveta Alenina,5.0,2019 20 December,"
i was wearing those many month everyt day. On the cold days, as slippers at home. They fell apart on me, but only from my abundant love for them.
"
Debie K.,3.0,2020 29 June,"
the material has stretched already after a couple of wearings, so not they slip off my feet. Disappointing.
"
Martha Cordell,3.0,2021 11 March,"
Perfect support
"
Angela,5.0,2020 5 June,"
I thought these were super cute.. but..I've only wore them 4 times and the whole bottom came off
"
Justin J.,2.0,2020 23 December,"
I've only had these for a year and they haven't held up (not even a daily use). The bottom has separated so I would have to glue the tread back on. I've had other pairs of Reefs for over 20 years and they've stood the test of time so they definitely don't make them like they used to.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2020 17 June,"
Runs a bit small. The bottoms are very slick. I probably will not purchase them again.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 22 September,"
Cute, comfy, neutral flip flop can pass as dressier or casual.
"
Sarah,3.0,2020 13 June,"
These flip flops are very narrow. They don’t fit well in width and the strap area.
"
Lisa,5.0,2020 7 July,"
Flip flops with arch support. It’s hard to find shoes anymore with good arch support
"
KELLY,2.0,2018 27 June,"
I am so  disappointed in this pair of reefs.  I have owned multiple pairs of reefs and absolutely loved them. The strap is pulling / fraying after two months with minimal use - worn about half a dozen times.  Amazon return period is up and upon contacting Reef directly I have to pay to return to see if they will even replace.  I have raved about how much I love my Reefs and how comfortable they are - but now I'm afraid to buy another pair.  Be warned these are not what I've come to expect as Reef quality.
"
M Hill,1.0,2022 26 January,"
These seem to only work for people with LONG toes.  The front is quite long while the back is short.  I wear a size 8 and my heal was too close to the back edge but could have gone a size smaller for the front to fit.  This is not the first time I've come across this issue with this brand.  Returning  :(
"
Christine M.,5.0,2018 9 March,"
I have alway loved everything Reef put out for their sandals.  They fit so perfectly and have amazing support for a sandal.  I will never buy any other flip flop from anyone other than Reef.  Amazing Product, always well worth the money.
"
Ann K Darling,3.0,2020 2 May,"
Have to return them. Really cute, but too small, like a whole size too small. Might re-order

Rachel L.,5.0,2020 1 April,"
These are amazing.  The price is perfect and they last forever. Soft cushioning under the feet. Breathable.
"
Laura,5.0,2017 30 July,"
I love these flip flops. I got a size 10 even though I usually wear size 8.5-9. I had tried on a 9!in the store and it was too small so I knew to order a 10  it fits like a 9 normally would for me.
"
Jason,5.0,2020 23 November,"
Love these flip flops. Very comfortable
"
Erin B,5.0,2019 12 May,"
Right out of the box these flip flops were very comfortable, and I love the color.  I haven’t done any heavy walking with them, but so far they are working out great
"
Robin G.,5.0,2020 10 July,"
I love my Reef flip flops, super comfortable, perfect fit.  Highly recommend!
"
CAnne,5.0,2018 12 July,"
I love the way these fit and feel on my feet. I wore my last pair out from using everyday last summer so happy to see that Reef still sells this style. I love the “cushion” Reefs.
"
Brinda Griffin,5.0,2020 3 December,"
Super supportive. Fits snug
"
Pen Name,5.0,2020 20 May,"

Holly T.,5.0,2019 10 April,"
Have had a pair of these in the past and they lasted so long and have been so comfortable I was really glad that you were offering this product!
"
Teresa Patrick,5.0,2018 8 June,"
These are the most comfortable shoes ever. They do run very small. I wear a 8.5 to 9 normally but I ordered a 10 and they fit perfect. So order a size and a half larger.
"
Michelle Regnier,5.0,2019 14 September,"
These are so comfortable and have great arch support! I love the pink color and wear these every day! I will definitely buy another pair!
"
Tammy,5.0,2018 8 May,"
These are awesome! Price was incredible. Fit was perfect.  IMO, the only flip flops I have found that do not aggravate  plantar fasciitis.  Would love to find other colors at the same price.
"
frequent customer,3.0,2018 14 May,"
Love the look and feel of these flip flops but they are pretty snug where the strap connects in the arch.  Luckily the material is soft enough so it shouldn't chafe but I think I paid too much for them.
"
Jessie,5.0,2020 26 June,"
I have narrow feet and this sandal runs more true medium.
"
Justina McCafferty,3.0,2019 21 November,"
Love them, but definitely not true to size. I wear a 7.5-8. I ordered an 8 and they are way too small. 😪

"
Susan G,5.0,2017 15 December,"
Wear them daily. Will need a new pair by next summer, but that’s ok because one can never have too many flops. Love Reef. Out of the many brands I’ve tried, Reef is now my go to brand.
"
Nikki Bloom,5.0,2020 23 April,"
Very comfortable and very light.I wished they would come in white !
"
Melba,5.0,2020 7 July,"
They're a great product but they have good traction.
"
MommaJ,5.0,2018 8 August,"
These are my favorite, I bought two different Reef sandles, these are by far my fav. Light weight, flexible, yet durable. Love the braided top, very classy, nice with a dress
"
Alex Swann,1.0,2022 25 March,"
Ordered these shoes every summer for several years and this year the shoes was too narrow to wear comfortably. Returned, looking for a new brand of flip flops
"
Amber callicoatte,3.0,2020 31 May,"
Not for wide feet but are comfortable and cushioned
"
Michael Richards.,5.0,2020 16 July,"
Very nice sandals, will definitely buy another pair
"
Corie Isaacson,3.0,2017 17 September,"
Love the fit.  Love the design.  Love the cushion of the footbed.  But they are horribly slippery.  Zero traction on the bottom, and I've almost injured myself a few times on tile or small patches of wet surface.
"
Cinderkelly,5.0,2019 24 September,"
These are my absolute favorite. They look nice and fit perfectly. The braided too just looks better with wear in my opinion.
"
Camille Barrett,5.0,2020 8 May,"
Love! Super cute, comfortable and durable. Also has great arch support
"
Nicole ready,4.0,2017 24 March,"
This style is more narrow than my other Reef flips flops.  They are not my favorite, but they will work.
"
Jojo,2.0,2021 19 May,"
The flip flops squeeked until I wore them in and after they were worn in and then the black rubber started bleeding onto the bottoms of my feet.
"
Teresa S,5.0,2020 29 October,"

"
Kelly Davidson,3.0,2020 13 June,"

"
Mary L.,4.0,2018 17 May,"
Very comfortable!  My daughter has stolen them from me twice!
"
Stephanie Bergquist,5.0,2019 18 July,"
These are by far my favorite reefs ever.  I’ve been wearing them every day since I got them last week! Highly recommend them
"
Susan N,2.0,2020 15 July,"
I rated these a 2 because the bottoms are dangerously slick.  I purchased this brand because I spend a lot of time on wet docks and boats.  No way!  I almost slipped down in the grocery store the other day on dry floors.  Will not be wearing them again.
"
scooby,5.0,2020 24 July,"
So comfortable, Reefs are the best!
"
Megan Lynn Lyons,5.0,2018 8 May,"
Comfortable and very cute but they run small! I normally wear a size 7.5 and because they don't have it I got an 8. They're snug. When in doubt size up ladies!
"
Jewels,3.0,2017 9 October,"
It would get 5 stars EXCEPT that the sandals are narrow and dangerous to walk in as soon as they get wet. You will slide and fall if they get wet, but other than that they are really comfortable.
"
natava,5.0,2018 19 September,"
I pretty much live in these & am buying my 2nd pair now, since 1st purchase January 2018.  I just wanted and sort of needed a new pair.

Runs small.  Originally purchased a size 8 for my daughter.  Returned those and got a size 9.  She usually wears a size 8.Very comfortable though!!!
"
Klarsen,3.0,2017 17 October,"
I did not like the width of the straps, wider than I like. Also the material of the straps after wearing only once got fuzzy and picked up (reminded me of a sweater like material).
"
Debra,2.0,2021 20 October,"

"
Lauri Moore,5.0,2019 30 July,"
Great flip flops! Super comfy and the coral color is perfect. As mentioned in other reviews, it is a bit narrow.
"
E. Johnson,2.0,2020 6 July,"
These flip flops are cute; however, they are more narrow than anticipated so the strap kinda hugs your foot.ALSO, the bottoms are SUPER flat so they are SLICK.  I've fallen while walking on wet grass while wearing these shoes due to the lack of traction.
"
Alisha,5.0,2020 15 July,"

"
K Rae,2.0,2020 30 July,"
These were tighter then I expected. I had tried on a pair of my sisters and they were so comfortable that I had to get myself some. I am trying to stretch them out a bit, but in the meantime, it’s not been pleasant:(

"
adaisy,5.0,2017 3 August,"
these reefs are so comfortable...soft and cushy...the only thing i'm not thrilled with is that the soles aren't as ""grippy"" as i would like a flip flop to be...otherwise, great flip flop from reef.

Flip flops are usually too wide for me.  These fit great!!
"
Sand0508,5.0,2019 30 July,"
So comfortable, I want to wear them all the time. Trade the regular flip flops for this brand.

Kathie G.,5.0,2020 19 May,"
Super cute and comfortable.
"
Emily Bickham,1.0,2020 23 August,"
SO dissapointed 😭 I was so excited about these and they ended up WAY too small ... They say size 9 but I literally had multiple people double check to make sure it didn't read as size 6 because they were THAT much smaller for a 9. I think these are fakes because I've had a handful of reef flip flops and they've never been less than great quality and have always ran true to size. These were not only way too small, but they are flimsy and seem to be made cheaply
"
Amy,5.0,2019 22 July,"
These are super cute and comfy. They do run a whole size small, in my opinion.
"
Stackett,2.0,2020 5 August,"
I loved everything about this flip flop except for the fabric on the bottoms of the soles. It’s unfortunate because they’re very comfortable but I felt like I was going to slip when walking on any smooth surface.
"
Vickie Bobeda,5.0,2020 11 July,"
Very comfortable
"
gqtoo,5.0,2019 23 July,"
Can wear right out of the box- super comfortable. Doesn't need break-in time for toe piece.

These are absolutely amazing feel like airI’m an 8 1/2Go to  9
"
DS2,1.0,2021 21 June,"
For a brand name like reef, the sole came apart of one of my sandals. Super unsafe to drive with cause when I would go to hit the break, the shoe and the sole would get caught. And then I wore to the lake one time and the toe ripped out so the were garbage.
"
Jeremy Russ,5.0,2020 29 June,"
Very comfortable
"
Kathleen MacKenzie,5.0,2018 23 June,"
Love these Reefs. I buy a new pair every summer, this style is incredibly comfortable and relatively supportive as far as flip flops go.
"
PowerHouse,1.0,2022 26 February,"

Another Amazon excellent product, price and Free Shipping!!!
"
AuntKay,5.0,2017 23 August,"
No black marks on your feet!  A little narrow, but stretch after a couple of uses. Good arch support and cushion.  Can't go wrong with reef flip flops.

"
Jennifer,5.0,2017 5 September,"
I love Reef flip-flops! Occasionally I come across a pair that's a little smaller fit, but these are perfect. I have flat feet so the arch support is great.
"
Kim dufresne,5.0,2019 28 March,"
I bought these for my daughter and she loves them.  Pricey but worth the money.
"
Valerina V.,5.0,2017 19 April,"
Just right as always. I can only wear shoes with arch support, which is especially hard to find in flip flops. A new pair of reefs is the best thing ever.
"

Heaven in a sandle! Love the color

Great for around the house. Wore out fast
"
Ellie R,5.0,2018 12 July,"
These are the MOST comfortable sandals I’ve ever owned! Soft and squishy like walking on a cloud with arch support too!!!!😍
"
Cherri T.,2.0,2017 24 April,"
I absolutely love Reef's and have been wearing them for many years! I'm a Florida girl, so flip-flops are a year- round shoe for me! I ordered a size 9 Medium, but the shoe feels really super narrow. The strap portion that secures into the sole near the arch area is located too far towards the center of the shoe. It's really uncomfortable you walk on - the straps actually rub underneath the arch of my foot.
"
jennifer,5.0,2019 29 September,"

"

Fit perfectly!
"
Brittany,1.0,2020 1 April,"
I purchased the first pair of these from a sporting goods store, where I had to buy 1 size up from what I normally wear (no big deal), and I’ve loved them. So I ordered this second pair thinking I was getting a deal since I paid $40 in store..... but I should’ve known better, I’m furious that I received a knockoff version when I was expecting the real thing. The pictures shown are real reefs but that’s definitely not what was shipped to me. Guess I learned my lesson.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2017 19 December,"
I love reefs, and like different colors. My daughter told me about them.  I have a few pair and will be getting more.
"
Laura Eagan,2.0,2020 6 May,"
These are not authentic Reefs. One foot's strap is tighter than the other. As I've worn them it has gotten better. For $20 they are cute and will serve the purpose but they are Knock Offs.
"
sherry fillweber,5.0,2019 7 June,"
I love the colors and the comfort of these particular flip flops.
"
Linda,5.0,2017 22 July,"
I haven't owned a pair of Reef thong sandals that I haven't liked.  They cushion, they support, and one has a multitude from which to choose.

"
Amazon Customer,2.0,2020 13 May,"
Comfortable to stand in. Tight getting the width of my foot in the shoe. Way to small in size. Gave to my daughter who wears a 7. Fits her perfect!
"
KEWB,5.0,2018 22 January,"
Reefs are my favorite flip flop. I love them and it shows because I wear them out each season
"
Lidocaine,2.0,2020 15 June,"
I’m very disappointed with the flip flops. They were a bit short and somehow slippery on surfaces. Too bad I realized this after I wore them outside!!!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 13 July,"
These are wonderful! So cushiony and soft
"
KW21774,1.0,2021 4 May,"
Poor comfort, faulty design or production. The strap was inserted improperly causing a lump under your foot on one side. Tried to wear a couple times and caused me so much discomfort I had to stop wearing them.
"
J. A. Marchand,5.0,2019 5 September,"
But so expensive! Come on, Reef!

"
Timothy,1.0,2019 13 June,"
This was a legit purchase.  My children purchased these for my wife for mothers day since we were planning a trip to Mexico.  Living up North, we had not had weather to wear them, so first time was second week of June when we went on our trip.  Fell apart while walking in airport as shown in the picture.  Of course the return window had expired.  Last time we purchase sandals or similar on Amazon.
"
Puddin,5.0,2018 22 June,"
Bought two pair for my wife. She loves them. Can't go wrong with Reefs.
"
Beth S.,2.0,2020 5 June,"
The bottoms of the flip flops are too slippery for me. They don’t have good grip. I’m afraid of slipping on smooth surfaces wearing them.
"
Melissa Gorecki,2.0,2020 9 March,"
I typically love Reefs, but not these. The cloth/upper was made for a very narrow foot. I would have returned them, but they fit my sister. She finds them comfortable.
"
Kelley Dougherty,2.0,2020 12 June,"
The bottoms have zero grip. I almost fell on my hardwood floors. They’re actually slippery on the bottom, so be careful on certain surfaces.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2017 19 May,"
Shoes seem well made,  but run a bit small. I am returning them and ordering a size larger.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2017 27 December,"

For my wife.  She was pleased.
"
LF,2.0,2019 21 August,"
I wanted to replace my old Reefs flip flops. I ordered the same size. I was very disappointed to find that the new ones are a 1/2 inch narrower than the old ones. I returned them.
"
R. Reynolds,1.0,2020 22 June,"
Going back. So disappointed. They are soooo slippery on the bottom!  I tried them on and my first step I slipped on my wood floor. They are very tight on the band if you have wide feet forget it. They are also extremely light weight...do not feel like quality sandals. Sorry I hate giving bad reviews
"
Tanya Gipe,5.0,2017 7 May,"

Great reef flip flops
"
T. Hemminger,1.0,2020 9 July,"
I ordered a regular size 8 but fits like a 7 and are very narrow.  Straps are not lined up right.  They seem to be irregular compared to other shoes in this brand.  Reefs were made in Brazil but these say Vietnam.  Not sure if counterfeit or a bad run.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 17 July,"
Just what she wanted.

"
Mysbelle,1.0,2020 6 June,"
The arch on the right foot is off...slightly more forward than left foot. Had three friends outside family try on in case it was my feet. Very uncomfortable. Can’t wear. Also these shoes run small! I wear a 7.5 and ordered an 8 and they just fit.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2018 20 February,"
They are great !  Just what I was looking for!
"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2020 24 June,"
These are fake Reef flip flops.  I compared them to my sister's to be sure.  The print ""Reef"" is totally different font.  The sole is fake as well.  I can send pictures as well.  These people are running a total scam.
"
Elizabeth,5.0,2019 17 July,"

"
Angela Rathbun,5.0,2018 9 November,"
Not boat worthy. Very slippery sandals!!
"
Barbara G. Young,1.0,2019 2 April,"
The foot strap is much narrower than my other Reefs. It cut into my foot. I do have wide feet, but I haven't had this problem with other styles of Reefs. I was hoping for something a little less flip-floppy to wear on vacation. I was disappointed to have to return these.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 23 July,"
Perfect
"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2021 20 March,"
Why is there felt on the bottom? So dumb. It’s as if I’m skating on tile with felt on the bottom of these flip flops. Horrible!!!

"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2020 6 June,"
There is no traction on the bottom of these flip-flops. They are dangerously slippery. They’re also too tight and a little too short. I don’t know who is now making Reef flip-flops now, but they’re very poor quality. Highly disappointed

"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2019 13 September,"
Worst fitting flip flops for the cost.  The braid strap is is too soft so your feet are all over the place.  Downsizing will not work because a 10 is an exact length for a women’s 10.  Fix the straps !!
"

I usually wear a 6 1/2 but Reef are different Depending on style.  These I tried in 7. They were too small. My foot was hanging off. It seemed like an 8 would be too big. I am not too sure. I have never been an 8. Bottom line they run small!!!!!
"

After wearing these around for just an hour, the inside arches of my feet were killing me from these. Super uncomfortable on the arch of your foot and no tread...quite slippery on tile floors.
"
Katherine E Stewart,1.0,2020 21 May,"
Death traps!!! These flip flops are perfect in every way... they’re cute, comfortable, supportive! HOWEVER, the rubber sole is covered in a slick fabric, and they’re DANGEROUSLY slippery when walking on smooth surfaces.

lilteccas,4.0,2020 20 July,"
Ordered my standard shoe size 8. On my first day of Amazon wardrobe trial. First impressions these shoes are very small. They fit my foot exactly with NO room to spare. If I spread my toes I'm off the sides. I do like the thick cloth straps, feel like my feet are well held, rubber and plastic are the worst. Will get them wet later and see how they are.

The soles of these are so slippery I have almost fallen so many timesTheyHave a arch support and for me that makes them uncomfortable to wear very longThey’ve a nice looking shoe
"
Sharon Crawford,3.0,2020 7 August,"
I order these flip flops all the time. They are the only ones I wear. These particular ones are so stretched out. Not happy with this particular pair
"
GadgetGal,3.0,2018 5 May,"
I always hope for a fit and support that the Reef Vision flip flops had. Yes, they were a men’s flip flop but they were the best I’d ever worn. I wore them everywhere, all day in Disney World and my feet were never sore or achey. Sadly they don’t make them anymore.These Cushion Threads really do run small, I normally wear 7.5 and prior (women’s) Reefs that I’ve had, size 8 was fine. These are borderline too small in an 8. They’re comfy but lack the kind of support and cushioning that the Visions have that I’m looking for. The straps are nice though, very soft and comfy.

Leah Parris,3.0,2019 1 October,"
Super comfortable but started fraying after wearing them a handful of times. Would be a great shoe if fabric was built better - but not worth $41 the way they are made now.
"
Ashley,5.0,2020 8 June,"
My Meem loved these. Of course the Reef brand is awesome anyway.

Heather Jackson,1.0,2020 2 July,"
There is NO way these are a size 10. I usually wear 9.5-10 and these were way too short and tight. So disappointed.

S. Solberg,2.0,2018 12 February,"
I bought these several months ago. They are dangerously slippery. I finally ground down the soles to get some traction. I have hardwood floors. I have had other reef shoes w/o any problems of this nature. I wouldn't buy these again. Sadly I bought two pair.
"
Pamela E Michael,2.0,2018 18 September,"
I liked the style but they run very narrow.
"
Rodney Boyd,5.0,2019 21 September,"
The blue color is very nice.  Not a flat color but rather blend of blues, whites, etc.  Fits nicely and looks great with tropical type styles.
"
Casey,4.0,2020 3 July,"
They do seem a little more slim that most sandals. I usually wear a size 7 in most everything. These fit a little snug, but honestly I like them like that. They won't slide off and they have room to stretch as they wear. Very comfortable. The cons are they can be very slippery on certain surfaces and they cloth part wraps under the foot a little too much. I definitely walk on it. Overall great sandal. I will buy again.
"
Tammy Redmon,5.0,2020 30 January,"

"
Nancy Valdez,5.0,2020 18 August,"
exelente
"
Dawn,5.0,2020 16 November,"
These are great! I like the way that the tops of the flip flop are woven material and it is very comfortable on the top of the feet.  I was worried it would be too thick but it isn't at all.  The bottom is a bit hard but from wearing many flip flops i know that you have to wear them quite a bit to break them in and make them your favorite flips!
"
Rachel Henderson,5.0,2021 29 April,"
These are great sandals. So great that I wore the life out of the first pair and finally got myself a second pair! They are so incredibly comfortable and have decent support for this style of sandal.

"
Nancy Pfarr,4.0,2022 6 February,"
Bought these for a tropical vacation.  I wear an 8 and sized up to 9, they are much more narrow than my other Reef flip flops, they fit just ok.  Not the most comfortable flip flops.  They were very, very hard to get on with wet feet.  Wouldn’t buy these again.
"

"
dporta,5.0,2021 7 March,"
I love Reefs and have been wearing them for years. I always get a new pair every year.  These are super cute.  Off white braiding and very cushiony, like walking on a cloud. My favorite flip flops!!
"
Sara F.,5.0,2022 4 June,"
These flip flops are the most comfortable I’ve ever owned. After years of wearing cheapo $3 flip flops, I wanted to invest in some better ones that offered more cushion and support. These did the trick! I walked around on vacation for several days in a row with no rubbing, blisters, aches, or pains.I’d recommend sizing up in these. I normally wear a size 8, but the 8s were too small. I exchanged for a size 9 and now they are perfect!
"
Marie,4.0,2022 1 July,"
Love the fit of these sandals/ flip flops. The arch support is great. So soft and cushiony. The only drawback is the soles are slippery. Ok as long as I’m on carpet or grass , but when walking on wood flooring  or tile I have slipped several times. Enough so that I don’t wear them in public.
"
B. Hanson,5.0,2022 30 May,"
Reef is the only flip flop I will wear due to their comfort and cute style. The cushion on this pair is amazing, the band is very soft and can wear these all day.

TRogers,5.0,2022 1 February,"
Absolutely love these. Super comfy. The straps are the best. They aren’t loose, middle piece doesn’t hurt and cushion is good. I wear between 9.5-10. Ordered 19 and works perfect. More than I would normally spend on flops but looking forward to wearing these.
"
lilmisssunshinesmommy,2.0,2022 24 June,"
These are super cute but oh my gosh they are tiny!! and I even sized up yet still couldn't even get it halfway on my foot. Sadly, I had to return them.

Best flippies for people who want support!  They stay on your feet so well!
"
Tabitha,5.0,2022 5 April,"
I love these things! The cushion is great and they're so comfy. I will say that they didn't last me more than one year though. However, they're worth replacing.
"
Ryan,5.0,2022 15 January,"
Comfortable and fit true to size.
"
cathy b.,5.0,2022 11 July,"
For someone experiencing foot issues the flip flop allows you to go to church, the grocery, the beach, or walk a golden retriever in comfort even when you are 71 years old.😊 I ordered same one in brown.
"
Daniel A,3.0,2021 1 January,"
The product shipped on time and well. The durability seemed well built.. but.. as soon as I tried them on, I noticed they were pinching into the side of my feet because of the narrow design/construction. Where the strap meet the base its too narrow for me and there is a open gap that pinches my skin on the bottom of my foot. I gave these shoes 3 stars because of classic Reef durability. Returning item and ordered a different pair of Reefs.
"
Michelle Gagnon,2.0,2020 30 July,"
I expected these flip flops to be a lot better, the support is almost not there at all.  They are a decent flip flop but not worth the price I paid.  I expected them to be thicker with more support as arch support was indicated on the ad.
"
Lise from DDO,5.0,2020 5 August,"
Very confortable  I would like to have them in black
"
gulsah,5.0,2020 12 August,"
Very comfortable flip flops worth the cost. I went to an unplanned hike with them and I can say they are almost more comfortable than my running shoes.

Ulrike Helms,5.0,2022 25 July,"
Ein toller Flip Flop, der nicht nur schick aussieht, sondern durch dieses Cushion- Material auch noch super bequem und weich ist. Das Band zwischen den Zehen ist angenehm und die Riemen sind so breit, dass sie nicht einschneiden. Das tollste ist die biegsame Sohle mit Arch-Support - super weich und bequem und stützt den Fuß da, wo es nötig ist.

Size 8. Comfy. The straps are like knit and feels good on my skin. However; summer is not here and that’s when I would really see if these flip flops are worth it.
"
Olivia,2.0,2021 16 June,"
These sandals were awesome when I first got them. The fit was great (I have a narrow foot), they are super comfy. However after a month of wear the foam has worn down to almost nothing and they are fraying at the toes. It looks like I have owned these for years rather than months.I would buy these for 20 dollars bit not a cent more. I'll stick with buying Roxy sandals.

Order a size above your normal shoe size! I'm always a shoe size UK 5, however my heel was slipping off the back when I received these in a 5. They felt really comfy though and loved the look so exchanged  for the next size up. Shame as have been charged twice for the delivery now... Hope you're worth it Reef!

Yes it has cushioning and yes it has arch support BUT EXTREMELY SLIPPERY on dry and wet surface.It’s even slippery on rough cement. Scared I’m going to slip and fall. Too bad it’s not grip like other reef flip flops. Sorry I do not recommend this. I’ve had many different reef flip flops, disappointed in this one.

"
YaYa,5.0,2022 5 October,"
I love this lotion. I’ve been buying it for years, but these 3 bottles for the price and the amazing pump are a deal. The pump is the best part! Gives you the perfect amount!
"
Ash,5.0,2022 10 September,"
Honest review incoming--I've had KP my entire life & have tried literally every product available (all the scrubs, exfoliating creams/body washes, special razors, etc) & nothing worked. Since I began using this around 2 yrs ago my legs are completely smooth and moisturized. I apply this lotion to my entire body after my evening shower & that's it! And if I skip using this lotion for a few days...the bumps & itchiness are creeping back. It really works & has given me so much confidence in my skin.
"

"
EileenMCastro,5.0,2022 28 April,"
Bought this because I couldn't find the usual brand I get and I was not disappointed. I just got this 3 pack today and suffer from super dry elbows and knees. I've used it 3 times today and I can already tell there's a huge difference in my elbows. With the previous brand I used I loved the smell and used it daily when I was at work but often forgot it and by the time I got back to work my elbows were like alligator elbows again. For being gone for two days the product I'm used to didn't seem to do too much if 2 days later I'm dry again. Not to mention it was soooo greasy which can make working a bit of a pain as we use an iPad for our system. This stuff is non-greasy though and is awesome.I see a lot of people complaining about the new smart pump but I personally haven't had any issues with it. It takes two seconds to just look at which end the lotion will come out of. It's not like it's super inconvenient. There's an arrow that points in the direction of which end it will come out of, and if you just look at the end of the pump you can see which one is the lotion end as there's some left over lotion from pumping. I just think people aren't really paying attention and find the smart pump a lot better than the old pump.As for there being a bunch of lotion left over at the bottom I couldn't say as I just bought this lotion so I'll update this when I get to that point. But to be honest with every lotion there's always been a bunch of lotion left over so I don't really see the problem. I guess the issue is the fact that the top is extremely difficult to take off if not impossible.

"
Katherine A. Morgan,5.0,2022 2 August,"
This is the best dry skin remedy that I have found. Most dry skin products are totally absorbed - gone in a couple hours and my skin is dry itchy and flakey. Vaseline with cocoa butter gives relief for my skin up to a couple of days! It's never greasy feeling and smoothes out further than some of the sticky thick feeling lotions. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering. They make Vaseline with cocoa butter as well but it's greasy and attracts my dogs fur that tends to be everywhere no matter how often I sweep, mop, dust etc. I resend this to anyone with dry flakey skin.

Simya,3.0,2022 30 July,"
I used it after a shower, it’s a nice moisturizer, smells like classic cocoa butter, and it’s not super thick, nor is it greasy.I see a lot of people complaining about the smart pump as well, but im having 0 issues with any of my three bottles. you turn the smart pump to lock and unlock it, and it comes off of the top of the bottle with a simple twist. Idk what everyone else is talking about honestly.However, the expiration date (i think???) on this bottle is concerning. I didn’t realize till after i used it the first time after my shower, but there’s a small “02/02” on the bottom of my bottle (all the bottles have different dates on the bottom of them, but they’re all super past the date). im not even sure if that’s an expiration date, or if you can use “expired” lotion, but it didn’t cause any irritation to my skin and it seems like it did it’s job, so im not sure what that’s about.
"
LittleItaly,5.0,2022 9 June,"
I have been using this product for quite some time. Have it on auto-ship.  It's always consistent.  The one thing I do not like - you cannot open the bottle.  It only has a pump so when it gets low you have to throw it away... to me feels like wasting some of the product.  This is a new design from before.  I'm not a fan.

I  have been using Vaseline Intensive Care Body Lotion for Dry Skin for at least a half a century.

With the repeated washing of hands the natural moisture also washes away leaving sandpaper like feel of  hands. I have used several different brands of moisturizing lotions only to leave a greasy feel and repeated applications.  Until NOW!  VASELINE INTENSIVE CARE is what DOCTORS should prescribed!  Moisturizing that penetrates and NOT sit on the skin, that takes care of the crocodile cracked skin leaving a soft touchable  feel..  The scent is subdued!  No loud perfume smell. Men to baby's can wear on  face to toes.  The PRICE is right.  PERFECT lotion.  JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED! 👌  🥰
"
Saiida M,4.0,2020 20 April,"
I love this lotion and like others have been using it for years. It is a great go to after shower before bed all around feel good for the skin. It has made my skin smoother than ever.  I was getting compliments. Which is why I may have to write to the company Unilever and tell them this new smart pump was a dumb idea. I Soo agree with the below comments and everyone that said you have to cut through the bottle with a sharp knife to get that last 1/3 or 1/4 or whatever and this lotion being about $8 in CVS or Meijer I thought it would be cheaper to buy from Amazon. The first time before Covid 19 (About August 2019). I got the three pack big bottles 24.5oz  for $23 no smart pump(that's one with extra 20%). This time because of a relisting I got three 20oz smart pump bottles and was going to return but will keep because this stuff is becoming rare in the stores. Next time, I will try Walmart because it's about $6 and then I will stock up. Hope this really helps someone that's new to Amazon or this product.

Okay so I just received mine today and the smart pump it was okay. They all say that the close and open are confusing well they are not. Horizontal is closed and vertical is open. The smell is okay, not very potent but it smell like artificial chocolate which not too bad and it is not oily but it kinda leaves a sticky feeling but not much and it disappears for few minutes. I will update more for month or so to see my skin condition.

I love this lotion, I've used it for the last 17 years and have never had any problems with it. I even used it on all of my children as newborns.... But recently they've made a new bottle with a new ""smart pump"" , the one to the right. With this new ""smart pump"" you can NO LONGER TAKE THE CAP OFF OF THE BOTTLE. I am not happy about this. There is about an inch of lotion in the bottom of the bottle that the new ""smart pump"" is not pumping out of the bottle!!! I now have to resort to cutting the bottle open to get ALL of the lotion out of the bottle. Please take the new ""smart pump"" back and give original bottle back, to the left.
"
ANGEL,5.0,2022 7 January,"
My family and I use this body lotion and it's really nice.  I like the nice Cocoa scent.  It keeps our skin moisturized all day.
"
Deeny,3.0,2020 8 May,"
The basic product is fine.  The new ""Smart Pump"" is not.  First of all, when you turn the top, as you must to get it to pump out the lotion, both sides of the top look the same.  So you can't tell which side the opening is on.  After two times of accidentally squirting lotion all over my table, I finally resorted to using a light colored nail polish to paint the half of the top that contains the openings.Today when I went to use some lotion after not using any from one particular bottle (I bought three bottles) fir a few days, nothing would come out.  I examined the opening and saw that these tiny  little holes were clogged.  So I had to use a pin to clear them out.  I have never has a pump type of lotion clog up like this before.Also, it does not appear that the pumping mechanism can be unscrewed from the bottle!  It appears to be fused onto the bottle as opposed to being a threaded screw top.Sometimes in life it is good to just stick with time-tested methods!  New is not always better.

I’ve been using Vaseline for sometime now I love it I’m not really happy with Vaseline for bringing out the new smart pump but that’s not the person who selling it’s fault it’s the company’s fault so I gave it a five out of five love the lotion great price for them because they are  three big bottles of lotion I will most definitely continue to Buy my lotion from you

I like the lotion and have been using it on my legs after shaving for a couple years now. I usually just buy at the grocery but with quarantine going on, I looked into other options. I was excited to see this product pictured with the old style pump. But when it arrived, it was the new style pump which leaves a lot in the bottle and can't be removed. I literally cut off the top with a razor blade to get at the leftovers - which lasted me another week. I'll use up what I have but will not buy again.

"
Catherine,4.0,2021 18 January,"
This lotion is absolutely amazing. Love love love this scent and the way it makes me and my children skin feel. The one downside is that the pump part of the lotion was extremely difficult for me to use. Took about 10 minutes of moving and playing with it in order for the lotion to start pumping out. Other than that, I have no complaints. Please fix the pump
"
SayaMenuki,5.0,2021 12 February,"
Vaseline lotion is an excellent moisturizer for dry skin and many people are surprised when they ask me where I got wonderful scent I use.I live in a very dry climate especially in the winter. So I do have to apply it a few times a day to my dry skin areas.It’s light and not oily.The 3 pack for this price is a great deal as well.

LeStarra,4.0,2021 25 April,"
Great lotion, but the new bottle head is annoying - it's identical on each side, so I've accidentally squirted lotion onto sheets/floors/my nightstand because I put my hand under the wrong side.
"
Stephanie Garnenez,5.0,2021 17 February,"
I had an exceedingly challenging time getting this lotion locally. Having to wash our hands more often now than before, we needed something that would moisturize but not leave us feeling greasy. This product does just that. I don't have to keep reapplying or wash my hands again to get the greasy feeling off. Excellent product and a genuinely nice price.

royal taylor,4.0,2021 18 January,"
Vaseline products are products you can rely on, and this lotion is no different. It goes on smooth and with the added cocoa butter, the lotion heals and moisturizes. I have rough dry skin. Try it for yourself and see if it doesn't do wonders on your skin too
"
Ginny,5.0,2021 20 December,"

"
Mary Snyder,5.0,2021 25 April,"
Doesn't look like the bottle but still the same and works really nice, I use it on my whole body after a shower and definitely makes my skin soft and keeps the itchiness away, gets rid of ashy skin and heals all while wearing it so really worth the money everytime.
"
Am&Am,3.0,2021 8 October,"
This lotion would be so much better if the pump didn’t look the same on both sides. I’m a person that likes to put lotion on in the middle of the night, and since I can’t identify the pump by feeling it my entire nightstand is covered in lotion! Not cool… not cool…
"
Steve C Robbins,5.0,2021 8 July,"
Definitely my favorite lotion BY FAR. Leaves my skin feeling moisturized and not greasy in the slightest. Only time I stop using it is if I wanna give something else a try but I always come back to this one.

Lightning Maximus,4.0,2020 1 April,"
If you skin is tender, dries out quickly, and is prone to cracking/peeling, then Vaseline Intensive Care Body Lotion, Cocoa Radiant is the product for you. This lotion is especially helpful if you shave regularly, spend a lot of time outdoors, or take a beating from dry climates. Personally, I'd prefer a squeeze bottle to a pump dispenser, but it's workable for all intents and purposes. Try it out, and see for yourself!

Tonya Miller,4.0,2020 12 September,"
Sadly I thought they were regular cocoa butter but they have an extra fragrance added to them.  I can't use fragrance due to sensitive skin and allergies so I cant use them.  Be aware that the smell isn't just a cocoa butter smell with this brand
"
Lori,5.0,2020 17 January,"
I love everything that has cocoa butter! I was searching for a moisturizer for several weeks and when I came across Vaseline brand, I didn’t think twice to try this out cause I’ve always loved their products and I’m glad I bought. You get 3 of the same sized bottles and a little lotion goes a long way! Makes your skin feels soft and smooth without that greasy feeling.Will be buying more for sure

"
Jacquelyn Crumpler,1.0,2022 29 September,"
I’ve bought this lotion from a grocery store in the past and enjoyed the scent, but when I first put this on it smelled a little funny, so much that I checked to see if it expired. All three are well past their expiration dates, and it’s noticeable. After checking reviews, it seems like a common issue. Don’t chance it!

Sonnet,5.0,2019 24 June,"
I’ve always bought the cheap Walmart lotion, but I got to thinking that Vaseline (petroleum jelly) is the best moisturizer i’ve Ever used, it’s just not practical. So I bought a few different Vaseline brand lotions (this body lotion and a lotion for hands and nails). They cost more, but do not disappoint. The times where I still grab the Walmart lotion I feel dry shortly after. With this my skin doesn’t feel dry for awhile. I will buy again, although this is certainly plenty.

APT,1.0,2022 26 February,"
I love this brand but the distributor sent very expired products dated 1/2004, 1/2009 and 1/2014 (see pictures).  The product is very thin, runny and the odor is overbearing.  Normally there is a thickness to it letting you know there is petroleum in it.  Instead of cocoa butter, this seems “perfumey”.  Not happy.  Want a refund without having to go all the way to the post office and to buy a new shipping package (through out the box it came in because I did not expect lotion to be expired! 😡).  Would be happy with a refund and to throw this crap out.  Not worth the effort to return wasting time, gas and effort!  (Otherwise the brand is excellent as I’ve used for years).  March 2022 UPDATE: refund was received from Amazon.

I've been using this for years on my face now, apparently it works because I am in my mid 30's and continually get complimented for looking like I am in my late 20's. Vaseline, please don't ever change or do away with this product, or if you do, at least a heads up so I can stock up. Also, smells great, like warm vanilla.
"
Pat,5.0,2018 6 July,"
I love this lotion! I first tried it at my friends house during vacation in the hot AZ sun and kept using it daily. It kept me moisturized all day long, brought out a nice tan, and wasn't greasy or slimy feeling on my legs. The smell is nice and light, and doesn't have that gross DHA self tanning scent. As soon as I got back home to IL from vacation, I ordered this 3 pack right away and it will always be a staple in my home,
"
C.A. Gray @ChiBabyMine,5.0,2018 25 August,"
This 3 pack of Vaseline brand cocoa butter body lotion is a great deal, and my go-to body lotion. Apply after showering and feel baby soft for days! It has a mildly sweet scent I love, typical to cocoa or shea butter. And I'm paying much less for it here than I was at the drug or grocery store. I go through this stuff pretty quickly and will buy again. 20.3 fl oz per bottle for a total of 60.9 fl oz.

I'm a huge fan of this!Smells amazing, and my skin feels so soft without feeling greasy. So happy I bought this for dry Colorado winters.

The nozzle is a joke. You can't tell which side the lotion will come from. I've held my hand under the wrong side countless times onky to watch tje lotion get all over the place at the other end. Annoying.

I use this lotion daily and have done so for years. I usually purchase it directly from Walgreens, but thought it would be more convenient to buy on Amazon. The lotion was watery and had no smell.  It was either different lotion put into the bottles or the product was not stored properly and the attributes changed DRAMATICALLY. I threw them away and am back to purchasing from Walgreens.  Good luck

Jordona,2.0,2021 12 August,"
I did not like the way it made my skin feel because it was so oily! However, I still rated it high because it smelled wonderful and once the lotion dry more after about an hour my legs and arms felt really moisturizered. I just personally do not like my lotion to be that oily.

One bottle has lasted me for 5 months now. Every time I use it it feels thick but then it sinks in my skin and it feel like It’s a thin layer of lotion. Keeps my skin hydrated, and I like the smell as well. Definitely what I was looking for.

Rebecca,1.0,2020 27 September,"
I have used this Cocoa lotion for years, I have loved it and it is has been my only lotion until now. The new smell is awful, and the pump is ridiculous; it leaves about 2 weeks worth of lotion at the bottom and there is no way to remove it - what a waste.  The photo shows the old style of pump, but I received the new style of pump. With the new pump, you can't tell which side the lotion comes out of, so I often end up with lotion on the counter.  Plus at times the pump pinches my hand - unbelievable!  Did Vaseline do any product/packaging testing at all???
"

Pros: price, packaging, amount you get for priceCons: I bought the regular bottle from the store and definitely feels different. The one on amazon feels like it doesn’t have as much moisture so I have to use more to get the same feeling as the store one.Update: I tried it again and it’s DEFINITELY a thinner consistency then what I get at the store; so I have to use more and for some reason this formula feels like it doesn’t even sink into the skin...not a fan really
"
Danni,2.0,2020 1 January,"
This used to be such a great lotion a few years ago with an amazing scent. It was not heavy but moisturized well.Obviously, Vaseline changed everything about it.The pump is crazy, it smells horrible like alcohol and it never seems to sink into my skin. It just sits on top and is sticky.It still cheap but not worth it.Really sad day for Vaseline lotion. Definitely not purchasing again.

The lotion is pretty good, but the “new and improved” is a deal breaker (pun intended);  dispenser broke after only a couple of uses. I’m not the first one who got screwed by the new dispenser - I saw several complaints on Amazon. Needless say, I won’t buy it anymore.

I've purchased the Coco Radiant before and even as a gift (which I now am embarrassed to say), but the scent has been changed.  It smells moldy, unnatural, and toxic.  Viewing other reviews (Walmart) I can see that I am not the only one who noticed this.  Very disappointed because I LOVED this lotion.

I’ve been buying this product for about 10 years from grocery and drug stores. I use it every night and have always liked the product and never had a problem with it. The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle is that it smelled slightly different from what it usually smells like. I applied it as usual and about 20 minutes later my skin got very irritated and hives started breaking out in some places. I’ve never had problems with this lotion before which leads me to believe it’s not from a reputable source.

I have been a loyal user of Vaseline Intensive Care Body Lotion, Cocoa Radiant for over 10 years and usually purchase in the store. Recently I purchased the 3-pack online and when I got it I was completely surprised by the scent - it's horrible.  I can't explain the scent but all three bottles have the same scent so they must have changed the formula. Definitely finding a new lotion.

I love this product but zero ratings for the smart pump design. It is very brittle and broke easily with little pressure. Although I was able to unlock the smart pump, it never worked and was jammed. This bottle is useless to me as I can't pump the vaseline cream.Pump should be simple to use and NOT oversmart to cause trouble.

I’ve been using Vaseline products, specifically the lotion, for probably 20 years...this lotion burns my hands now and has a weird chemical smell to it.  I don’t know if Vaseline changed their formula or what but this is not the same thing I’ve been using.
"
Nic,2.0,2022 5 October,"
Not sure of anyone else notices but the new bottles with the big “V” on them, they changed the formula from the original. They added the ingredient Coumarin which is also used in rat poison. I will buy as much of the older bottles I can find because I love that one and the scent, but not these new bottles. They did the same with the Vaseline Petroleum Jelly with cocoa butter. The “Limited Edition” tubs now have coumarin. But do what you want. Also when I asked about this change on the actual Vaseline website they erased my comment.

I ordered the three pack with the subscribe and save bc my daughter loves this lotion, but when they arrived, all of the tops were broken. I have tops from some others that I had bought in store. I cancelled my subscribe and save.

The new ""Smart Pump"" has an unremovable top. The tube down to the lotion is too short, leaving about a quarter bottle unused before the pump can't reach it. You can't remove the pump easily or at all, so if you want to be economical you have to either cut the bottle open to reach the remaining lotion, or perhaps get channel lock pliers to break the pump off (haven't tried yet, and I suspect it will break the pump mechanism). Also the pump is symmetrical with a hole on only one side. Each time you pump you have to feel for the hole or else you will spray lotion on the floor instead of on your hand.Overall this ""Smart Pump"" bottle is a scumbag move by this company. I will deliberately avoid buying this product in the future, even if I find the lotion to be just okay.Edit: with a flathead screwdriver I was able to remove the lid...it kind of unscrews with coarse threads. There is a barrier that prevents rotation...a screwdriver can bypass the rotation lock. It is still a cynical design based on the fact that a percentage of consumers won't be able to do this

Sharon Robertson,1.0,2020 13 July,"
Something was wrong with the order I've got it smelt like bug spray and didn't moisturize my hands. I'm pretty sure I received a fake product because I've ordered this before and it was fine then.
"
Ty Luvah,1.0,2020 27 August,"
The pump on this lotion has two sides that look exactly the same. Be prepared for those accidental moments of squirting lotion all over. Very poor bottle design but good quality lotion.

What were they thinking with the 'smart pump'? Google Vaseline smart pump. You will find endless links trying to help you get it open. The worst design I have ever seen.

AR,1.0,2017 17 July,"
Horrible new scent!  Do NOT buy this unless you like lotion with an overpowering chemical smell.  YUCK!  The old formulation had a rich, warm, fabulous cocoa butter scent.  The new smell is positively ANNOYING.  Power plant with a hint of faux flora note.  What were you thinking, Unilever?  Ugh.

This is not truly Vaseline cocoa butter. I have used the product for years, and these particular bottles delivered have a floral scent, despite the packaging.

Klaus Von Beaverhausen,2.0,2022 20 April,"
The lotion itself is great I love it.  The new pump is awful.  Both sides look the same, can’t tell you how many times I’ve squeezed it from the wrong end and got the lotion all over.  Finally painted half the top white so I know which end is which.  Don’t let’s kids anywhere around this pump unless you don’t mind it being everywhere.  Seriously how did this even make it out of product design let alone testing.  Idiots need to be fired.  Won’t buy this product again till they fix the design.

Linda Deneen,4.0,2019 25 July,"
I have used this product for years, and I love it.  It keeps my skin moist and prevents itching due to dryness.  I do have one complaint, though, and I am posting it here in hopes that the manufacturer sees and responds.  Recently the manufacturer has changed the pump bottle so that you can no longer unscrew the pump top when the lotion level gets low.  I have, in the past, taken the top off and tipped the bottle over to get the remaining lotion out of the bottom of the bottle.  There is almost always quite a bit of lotion that will not come up through the pump when the level gets low.  Now that I can no longer unscrew the top, I have had to resort to using a box cutter to cut the top of the bottle off.  I refuse to let the last bit go to waste.  Please, manufacturer, give us back a screw-off top.

I have super dry skin year round but when fall hits wow it gets bad.  I hate when my cuticles start to crack and ruin my manicure.  This stuff Is nice and thick, goes on smooth, has a nice scent and really lasts.  I am an OCD hand washer at the office so this will go fast, lotions on last me about a month before I have to Re Up. Every Vaseline product I have tried has been great.  Keep up the good work!  You got a customer for life 
"
David morales lee,3.0,2021 10 September,"
Other reviewers are correct. When using a serated knife to cut the bottom of the bottle to get the lotion, you will wonder why you bought it.

Eric H. Pangman,5.0,2019 24 May,"
I've been using this product for years. I apply all over after my shower while still wet. I have a big TIP...when the plunger no longer sucks up lotion for application, just cut the bottle in half about 3 inches from the bottom. I guarantee there will be 2-3 ounces left that would otherwise get thrown out. I suggest a rebuild on the bottle to make it good to the last drop.

Leah C Zegouros (Celestial Readings),1.0,2021 6 December,"
What imbecile conceived of this dispenser idea?It’s absolutely idiotic! All I can say is; some product designer on another continent (most likely far eastern) is either hanging his head in shame or having a jolly good laugh.I positively canNOT imagine what the point is of a double headed identical nozzle that only squirts from one side (and half of time you don’t get the right side until you have put some sort of a marker on the top of it so you KNOW which side is going to dispense the lotion.  And if you’re using it in a subdued lighting situation, that does not always work. Half of it ends up on the floor, on the table top, or somewhere else! Every time it happened, I became SO angry, and that is not my nature!But seriously, HELLO?!!!I eventually put the contents into another ‘normal’ dispenser I found at a general store.First and last time for this PETROLEUM BASED PRODUCT.
"
V. Kneifl,1.0,2022 24 January,"
I've used Vaseline intensive care for years. I love the product, but hate the new dispenser that turns. When I'm in a hurry, I might have it turned the wrong way and it dispenses all over the wall, the vanity, you name it. The thing eventually plugs up and even if I have it turned in the right direction, it sprays straight up, to the side, everywhere but in my hand. I'm considering changing to a different product just to avoid the hassle of getting it out of the container. I finally poured it into a Mason jar and dip out what I need with my fingers!

"
Elga Suarez,1.0,2021 30 August,"
Whoever had the idea to change the pump on the bottle obviously does not use the product. I have used this lotion for over 30 years and will never buy another bottle with this new pump. If you need a video to learn how to open a pump on a bottle, then there is a serious issue with the product.  I also agree with the reviews that you can no longer open and remove the top, leaving a lot of lotion in the bottle !
"
Amber Fulford,2.0,2021 4 April,"

Good overall and tend to like this brand better than others..I liked it so much as I always buy 1 at a time,,this 1 time I bought the 3 pack and the 2nd bottle top to unlock and work,, does nothing but go around in circles. Maybe broke in shipping process or the inspector missed this defect  none the less I bought this with good faith and wasted my time and money..I will switch brands soon that actually work.

You can’t go wrong with Vaseline Shea cocoa butter lotion. It takes the ash away leaving your skin smooth and soft. It is also reasonable price and gets the job done by hydrating your skin. Amazon had buy $30 worth of products and get 10 dollars off, so I 6 bottles for $21.00 and some changes. You can’t beat that deal. I highly recommend this lotion.

Vaseline is a good product for the price. Shop around and compare prices to your local stores if you only want 1 bottle. I bought the 3 pack and it didn't save me much money but it was convenient to buy it online. It's the right amount of thickness to put on your whole body (not a thin watery lotion or a super heavy cream), smooth and smells good.

This is not the same lotion that I’ve used for the last ten years. I thought that they were just changing the shape of the bottle, but they also changed the fragrance.

Doesn’t have that super water texture or oily feeling. It’s not too thick. I definitely love it, it’s a light scent of cocoa butter so it isn’t overwhelming. I also like the pump, it’s easy to push down and not to much of struggle to keep pushing. Recommend!

J. J. Moses,4.0,2022 28 September,"
I like the fact that these don't have any harsh chemicals in them but make sure you follow the directions for use okay you're going to have to surround your deck or whatever are you're sitting in exactly as it describes and that involves sticking these things in the ground and lighting them standing straight up in sort of a triangle fashion every 12 feet or so around the area you're going to be in 10 to 20 minutes before you're going to be occupying the area you want these to have time to get going. If you do it right, they actually work. And I think they're better than bug zappers because bug zappers get mostly moths and about 10% top mosquitoes. I only took one star off because you know set up is a little a bit of a pain but you know it's worth it. Because it first you're thinking hey it's an incense stick let me just put it in this incense holder here on the porch and light it that's not how it goes. Follow the instructions to a t and you have yourself a barrier shield from the mosquito but I don't really care for the smell too much which you don't have to deal with a lot if you follow the directions. I will continue to use them.
"
Nathalie,4.0,2022 31 October,"
I suppose using just 1 might not be as efficient in the hot south, but I place 3-4 in flower pots around the decks and have not had mosquito problems. Love that they last about 1 hr (I also have long coils for extended period of time). Love that I can turn it off to finish later by pressing the hot end on a stone.
"
Wendy,4.0,2022 10 October,"
We had a bad mosquito problem this year. I tried everything, the electric zappers did nothing . Repellant for skin was so so. Lit one of these up in the house. Very soft pleasing scent that fills the room fast. Don’t even have to burn the whole stick. The mosquitos seemed to have disappeared! Burned one on our patio, never saw one while it was burning. This is definitely my go too next season. You get enough incense to last for a long time because you only have to burn a couple to see them go away. Great find
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 2 November,"
We sit outside to give out Halloween candy and are always swatting mosquitoes and other flies away as it gets dark. I lit a few of these and put them in holders around our sitting area, and it kept all the bugs away. Each lasts about 45 minutes, but the package has a huge supply that we have enough for the next 2 Halloweens. Totally recommend these!
"
Surmai Lee,5.0,2022 16 October,"
Usually something will bite me as long as I stepped out site for a few minutes. I tried essential  oil spread, mosquito bracelet. They help but I have to keep adding more spread, sometimes I still got bitten. I brought this for me for working in the garage. I seems worked, nothing bit me for a good 10 minutes, then I put it in my bag walk around the property, It keeps the bugs away from me. So far I only used twice, but it seems to work.

This is the mosquitoe insense to buy! This is the only one that smells like my grandmother used to use back in the 90s. It works too!

"
Luis,5.0,2022 29 October,"

"
Cara A.,4.0,2022 23 September,"
They were great! …for two weekday evenings with friends for a few hours. We went through the entire package (burning one at a time) in two evenings. :( they smell great and they work well. Just a bit overpriced given the burnout time.
"
T. Thompson,5.0,2022 15 October,"
So far has worked well to keep away the small pesky mosquitoes. We light and place in raisedPlanter near our “California room” and seems to work in that 10-15 foot area.  Might need more for larger areas. Smell is tolerable.

A_diva,3.0,2022 4 October,"
Didn’t get bit by mosquitoes but it seems you need to use a ton of these to get effective coverage. I was using a pod tent , so only for 1 person.  I thought 1 is sufficient. What I noticed is it made a barrier somewhat but in a limited way. So the mosquitoes were all piling up at the ceiling of my tent which was a very odd situation. None came near me but they seemed trapped in my tent to avoid fumes. I had it at front of tent so I expected they wouldn’t come in at all. Instead they came in but tried to avoid the smell as best as possible. So I guess it works I’m just thinking if I tried to use this at a picnic outside it be best to have multiple around the perimeter versus at the table for instance . Seems to act like a small barrier

katiejomcd,4.0,2022 23 June,"
There's probably no bug repellant that works 100% but we do notice a nice difference when these are lit. We put them in a wide circle around us, or in the corners of where we are and within a few minutes we are swatting less at our arms and legs. The smell is distinct, but it's a lot like a campfire and it doesn't bother our family. They last about 45 minutes each; wish it were longer, but it's not a big deal to light another round. We use them camping and when we're sitting around in our backyard at home. I ordered another pack!

Kathy,4.0,2022 9 July,"
Like the repellent sticks. They are effective in keeping bigs away from the picnic area but leaves a heavy ash below the area they are burning . I have to move the sticks further away so the ash does not get on tables or clothing, or pool. I think burning two at a time further away will be effective.
"
John F. Jamele,5.0,2022 17 September,"

L F,5.0,2022 5 September,"
I've used other sticks like this before and their effectiveness is questionable. These 100% work in all my experience over this recent summer. If you have one lit and you carry it with you, zero bites. Easy to put out and stick in a potted place to re-light the next time you go out. 10/10
"
Fredy Garcia,3.0,2022 17 October,"
Great to pair these with something else like a hanging zapper. The smoke wasn’t as thick as I thought to deter all of the mosquitoes. Scent was alright, but not pleasant to smell for an hour. Although it probably did have some effect, it unfortunately was not enough to stop the bites entirely

I received these and couldn’t wait to try after reading reviews. I have many different things I use to fight those little enemies outside BUT these are nice and easy to deal with! My husband gets bit up more than the rest of us but I lit one of these last night and he didn’t complain once! The smell isn’t bad and is similar the regular incense. I would consider lighting a few and I thought it came with a holder but it does not. Overall, I would order again and recommend these!
"
Jill,5.0,2022 12 September,"
These sticks are awesome. We have started to have a mosquito problem. Started lighting these and mosquitoes were gone. They smell good too.Only negative is they burn quickly.

These insentc are just like the Citronella candels. It smells good but does not work to keep moquitos away. These also burn out way too fast.
"
Phoenixms,5.0,2022 21 August,"
I have a small patio, I burned three pieces of incense at a time.  The smell was very pleasant.  As I was watering my patio plants, I saw a couple of bees, which I normally don't see.  I don't know if the smoke attracted them or not.  No mosquitoes though.

Arrived when promised. Thinner than I expected, so it’s done after maybe 30-45 minutes, and messy without something to catch the ashes. Smells nice, seemed to work and then I got 4 mosquito bites in 20 minutes on 1 day.

"
Myra,5.0,2022 10 July,"
Was skeptical at first but wow these worked the first few minutes I was outside!! I read the reviews and they all sounded too good to be true. Will definitely be ordering more because we still have a long way to go for mosquito season where I live. I’m so glad I can sit outside and not get attacked by dozens of mosquitos. I wanna try them indoors cuz I have some that go in from my back door but I haven’t just yet.
"
EcoAl,5.0,2022 27 August,"
I was skeptical when purchasing these but they work great! I use them regularly on our patio and even took some to the lake where they worked like magic!
"
Matt,5.0,2022 25 July,"
They actually work and last a decent time. I have a medium size pool and spaced about 8 around, didn't see a single mosquito. One night had a few people over and saw quite a few mosquitoes, after lighting some they were gone in a few minutes. If you need something every single night you might need something else but for weekends/occasions I'd recommend.
"
Zach mortimer,5.0,2022 31 August,"

Amazon Customer,4.0,2022 1 April,"
It seems to be working so far. I used three of the incense at one time. I have only done this once but seemed to work. I think it has a nice fragrance if your used to incense burning . I’ve tried a number of things to be rid of getting bitten by mosquitoes and I think I found the method and product.

Happy Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 6 July,"
I sit outside all the time for hours and have noticed I never get bit when I light these incense. The minute one goes out or if I decide to not light one at all, I see mosquitoes hovering and usually go in with at least 3 bites
"
On-lineShopper,5.0,2022 24 July,"
These are nicely scented and easy to use. We lit a bunch and stuck them in flower pots around the perimeter of out seating area outside, and only the brave mosquitos entered the perimeter.

Char,5.0,2022 13 July,"

G80L,5.0,2021 30 June,"
So I bought these for my not so outdoorsy husband in an effect to bring him outside… turns out these won’t change a man but he will light them to keep me from getting eating up by the beautiful Texas state bird aka the mosquito! He made a Great Barrier Reef around my lovely sitting spot which is also known as the great mosquito breeding grounds for the angriest of all the mosquitoes here is Deep South Texas! Needles to say I had one MF try to bite my shoulder so we repositioned these not so lovely smelling incense &  Wala I have been saved! Not a bug has come near me! I sat outside gossiping with the gals & gaygals for an hour before we had to set up another insect barricade! So if you like to be outside for a few hours plan on burning 6-9 of them! We already ordered more!
"
JAU,5.0,2022 23 July,"
Used three on a small patio and was not bitten - which is a big improvement.

I had high hopes, I’m not sure what other people are doing to get these to work but I have several lit around me and I’m holding two of them and I still have mosquitoes coming at me. Basically I am making myself smell like this smoke but it’s not helping keep the mosquitoes away, I’m disappointed.

Ana,4.0,2021 8 October,"
I live in Texas , so it’s fair to say I know how a few things about mosquito repellent!They run out too quickly , compared to GOUSO , the ones I used to buy here on Amazon , that’s why I only gave 4 stars .But they are as efficient, if they could just last longer …
"
Nana ,5.0,2022 19 June,"
Dispersed mosquitoes outside front door. Love the smell! That may just be me, but prefer this over some chemical solutions to the same problem, which even smell toxic.
"
Reviewer,5.0,2022 6 April,"
I can't believe these things work, but they do! After about 5 minutes of them being lit, no mosquitoes at all! As soon as they went out, back came the mosquitoes. They last for about 45 minutes, which is nice and they don't smell bad, in fact they sort of smelt pleasant.
"
griffin,5.0,2022 28 July,"
Works well
"
Crystal Mason,5.0,2021 27 June,"
These incense repellent really work! Not too strong and easy to light. After they burn out the bugs stay away for at least another hour or so. I gave 4 stars for value for money because you will need at least 3 or 4 packs to last the summer if you spend a lot of time outdoors on your patio or deck. You will need to burn at least 2 or three sticks at a time, I was on my deck for 5 hours and used 6 sticks.Also you will need a holder yo fit these incense sticks they are long and will leave ash on you patio or deck so be aware of that.Please sell a coffin box or holders to accommodate the size of the sticks and provide safety.
"
Armen,5.0,2022 13 April,"
I was skeptical at first because of the scented candles don’t work at all. These scented sticks are very affective. They have a burn time of 45 min and does not create an outstanding amount of smoke. I would recommend special for the price.
"
LMEA,4.0,2021 1 June,"
I have enjoyed using these and feel they are effective in keeping the mosquitoes away. I like that they are natural and the scent is not overwhelming. The reason I did not give them five stars is that they burn down super fast. We were doing some yard work this weekend and I kept having to light more. I suppose using the thicker sticks that have a longer burn time would be better. It’s difficult to imagine what you would use these for because the burn time is so short; I would estimate less than 30 minutes.

"
Anna,4.0,2021 27 July,"
These work like a charm (I usually light 3 at a time, placed on the ground in incense holders) but I don’t like the smell. They are supposed to be natural but they smell of chemicals to me. I use another brand I much prefer as well.
"
Jay,4.0,2021 24 September,"
The only con is that each stick lasts for 15-20 mins. They burn fast. It it worked well and kept mosquitoes away. The smell wasn’t harsh like most products.

"
OhioMom,3.0,2022 4 January,"
Bought these for our back patio in Florida, but even with the incense burning 2 feet away from us there were still mosquitoes biting us. We had better luck keeping the bugs away when using regular incense that has more smoke when it’s burning.
"
Rebecca L Dudla,4.0,2021 26 July,"
Mosquitos are bad this year. I like to sit outside with the dog.  I light a few of these and do not get eaten up while I am outside!  Great natural alternative to bug spray!

These work great! At first I didn’t think they worked that well but it was because I didn’t follow the directions. You must put these all around where you will be sitting outside, I put them all around the patio behind the couches and they were great! No one was eating during our Halloween party :)

Summertime is bug season and the mosquitoes and flies (yes, they bite to) are plentysome.  I use it in my inclosed garage at night and during the day, the bugs keep away. No stray bug coming in. Just light it up, let the smoke come out and it will do the rest. I recommend this product to all my friends.

Tanya,2.0,2022 13 August,"
Scent is good, easy to use but they didn't help with the mosquitos at all.

"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2021 14 August,"
Have used now for a couple of weeks now and it’s ok but still get some bites. I put three around the small porch we sit in but still get a few bites. It’s better than not having any at all. If we put these repellents down AND spray our ankles and arms we almost never get bitten by those pesky mosquitoes!  I will continue to use and see if anything improves. Maybe will use more to see if that helps…
"
Amber,5.0,2022 16 May,"

Miss Mary,5.0,2021 24 September,"
They work as they say the will. I'm not a big citronella fan, but when it comes to mosquitoes, I will do just about anything to keep them at bay. The price was a little high, but like I said, just about anything. And I was glad I bought these,  because they worked great.
"
Trasse,5.0,2021 18 October,"
This works great as I have a neighbor with a swimming pool they never use which is basically a mosquito farm now. Life is like it says and let burn for about 10 minutes and then you go out and there will be no mosquitoes to bother you
"
R&A B.,5.0,2021 4 December,"
We will put 3-4 of these upwind from where we sit when camping.  They last awhile, and work very well, even against the mosquitoes in N Michigan.  Up there they are so big they come with landing lights.

Ray,4.0,2021 14 August,"
It isn’t 100% effective….still got a couple bites, but better than usual.
"
The Forestgirl,5.0,2021 2 November,"
These really work repelling all insects including mosquitoes. They are long burning and deliver a nice drift of smoke that lingers in calm conditions, keeping bugs away.Update: these also drive away wasps, and they will not make nests on any surface exposed to the smoke.
"
Dyanne,5.0,2022 17 April,"
It really works and the smell is not that bad
"
Destiny Parker,5.0,2022 17 May,"
Keeps mosquitos away!
"
Lava,3.0,2021 31 July,"
Indoor:  eliminated houseflies, reduced fruitflies, no effect on roaches.Outdoor:  No effect.  On the right, flies attack your left.  Left, flies go right.  Under the chair, flies go up your head.  A breeze blows them away better.I'm picky on how much smell is ""pleasant"".  The smell is certainly potent, but flies don't apparently notice.Value, though...$15 / 50 equals 30 cents a stick, no loss.
"
Justin Perez,4.0,2021 5 July,"

MB shops ,5.0,2021 1 August,"
These incenses are wonderful.  The aroma is very pleasant and they keep a large area protected from insects.  They come in a very practical packaging to store and thus keep them protected from moisture.  I highly recommend them for this summer season. it is a wonderful product for the price and value
"
Face,1.0,2022 19 October,"
Mosquitoes weren’t remotely deterred by these. I’ve found the 3 wick candles work best when working in the driveway at night. I only tried these because they’re cheaper and I assumed I could put one in multiple places having more affect but I was wrong

S.K.,1.0,2022 18 August,"
We lit the sticks went back in & waited 10-15 min (per the directions) before going out and they did not work for us at all. We were right beside the sticks and mosquitoes were still landing on us. I do not know if the don't work at all or if we just received a bad batch. We returned them and are looking for something different that is more effective.
"
David Freyer,1.0,2022 17 September,"
I must have got some bad ones.  I was watching the mosquitos fly right through the smoke and bite me.  The only way that I could keep bugs away was to hit them with the box!

"
Yani,5.0,2021 18 July,"
These work! Using them nearby entry to keep flies and mosquito from flying inside. They last about as long as a regular incense stick would, 30-40min. I looooove the fresh scent it gives off too! Only wish I had more!
"

Each stick lasts for about 45 minutes and the scent is pleasing.  Did a great job keeping our patio mosquito free!

Smells like lemongrass & a well put together quality. When it is lit, I can sense mosquitos are not around. Highly recommend.

"
D. Sapphire,1.0,2022 21 August,"
unfortunately there is not much to. say other than it does not work. lit 5 of these things in a circle around a very small sitting area, no wind to blow the smoke away. yet the mosquitoes were still all over me. can not recommend this product. the effectiveness reflects the cheap price.
"
Sharon O'Farrell,5.0,2021 1 June,"
Al of a sudden there are roaches all over my apartment.  I burn one stick in every room and the roaches do not like it.  Also, back door always open for my guide dog and flies and other bugs stay outside now.
"
brian hamill,5.0,2021 5 October,"
Normally I get eaten alive by mosquitoes but this incense keeps them away as well as other bugs. One stick burns a long time too. Would definitely recommend!
"
Coqui,5.0,2021 11 July,"
I'm usually the mosquito banquet at a picnic, but light 2 of these every 3 hours and I don't get bitten at all. I'm able to do a little gardening after work, provided that I light these first.
"
tktroma,5.0,2021 19 June,"
I am not bothered by mosquitoes- they don’t seem to like me, but others at our outside table said the sticks were working for them. The aroma was like a pleasant incense stick might be. Pleasant and effective.  Great deal
"
Judy Bare-Siler,5.0,2021 22 June,"
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE MOSQUITO STICKS❣️❣️❣️ When I am doing yard work or I'm outside with my 4 year old granddaughter I use as many as I think we need....REALLY WORKS!!! (mosquitos LOVE use because we're so sweet!!!)
"
cindylou bardash,5.0,2021 28 September,"
They are great! I use them on my front porch. It's so much nicer not swatting away those pest. And the smell is better than any I've tried.
"
Donna Propeck,1.0,2022 16 August,"
Took them to the Bahamas with us and we had them spread out all around the patio (underneath so we could be safe outside) and they were extremely hard to light and keep lit. Plus the bugs didn’t care about them. It was my wedding day/night and we all got bit up.
"
realsource2011,5.0,2021 23 July,"
Set two up 5 feet from me on my porch each AM no more bites.  I live in FL and sit out there 5-7 AM to enjoy my coffee now without getting bit by anything

It is a good value for your money, because you get enough for quite a few sittings
"
William A.,1.0,2022 9 August,"
I lit a bunch of these after days of burning only a few at a time. This honestly felt like it made the mosquitoes hungry. I watch mosquitoes hover in the smoke inhaling it like a joint. These are an absolute joke and the mosquitoes love them. Buy a citronella candle instead.
"
Brando,1.0,2022 21 September,"
I got these sticks and the pop up fly trap. Been having a mosquito and fly issue. The fly trap worked like a charm as advertised. These sticks were terrible.
"

"
Og312,1.0,2022 16 July,"
It burnt really fast, while it was burning the flying critters hovered above the smoke loving every minute of it. When I requested a refund Amazon gave me less than 24hrs to bring it back, like that all that I had on my schedule so I guess I’m screwed thanks Amazon but feels like you’re going down hill with these policy changes. Buyer beware!
"

Really hoped these would be the answer for So Cal's mosquito issues this summer, but these sticks do not stay lit.

christina,1.0,2022 19 April,"
We have mutant mosquitos that are active all day, come into our house, and bite multiple times.I wanted something non-toxic but this just doesn't work. It was a waste of money. I burned this while hosting an outdoor dinner with guests and everyone got completely eaten up. The rest of the package is sitting in a cabinet, waiting to be thrown away.We've moved on to a $40 bug zapper that works on mosquitos and flies. My father in law uses the same one in Florida and swears by it.
"

"
Daniel Johnson,1.0,2021 18 August,"
Had them lit up all around me about 24 inches apart in my back yard and the flying vampires literally flew right between the smoke from both sticks and made a safe and successful landing  on my thigh which was full of blood that I tried so hard to keep inside of my body. It casually drove its evil syringe into my blood filled thigh and I had so resort to the old tried and true method of the tricep powered palm of death that I summoned to come down upon it before it could realize it screwed up. Right after this unfortunate event for it, I quickly threw the ones I lit and the entire pack I had just received that day into the bonfire.
"
TammyB,2.0,2021 22 August,"
I can hardly smell anything, and that's because the sticks are very difficult to keep lit.  You have to keep lighting it, and when it is lit, it does nothing for flying insects.  Maybe I got a bad batch, too dry, too old - not sure.  It was promising, but did not work for me.
"

After setting several of these through the yard with or without high winds, I could see all the mosquitoes flying, almost seemed, towards the inscents, like they were attracted to the heat and we still had to put on spray (the one sure fire way to not be bit).

I'm not sure how anyone wrote a 4 star review or higher on the efficacy of this product, but it certainly does NOT repel mosquitos.... or anything for that matter.It actually seemed to attract more bugs, including flies, which I never have on my porch.The only positive thing I can say regarding this product is the scent; it's pleasant and not overpowering.Otherwise, I would stick to good old citronella candles.
"
alex,1.0,2021 24 September,"
Easy to light up but the smell is not pleasant at all and mosquitos did not care at all, I did light 6 of them but mosquito kept coming and biting non stop,  I have couple of coils I light them up and mosquitos gone away, so product doesn't work, don't buy it.

These only last 45 minutes, the scent is overwhelming and makes my throat hurt. The mosquitoes still manage to bite my legs.The picture is of my right calf, after the sticks had been burning for 15 minutes. I have to burn at least 6 of them before they have any effect.
"
user,1.0,2021 26 July,"
The product does not repel bugs at all. I lit one on my porch, on a night with little to no wind. It lasted about 30 minutes and the bugs still swarmed the light on my porch just as much as without the incense. Waste of money for sure.
"
Hannah,1.0,2021 13 October,"
Save your money and burn some 4th of July punks, because that's exactly what they smell like. Expensive punks. They didn't repel anything and they stink. Not even a trace of citronella, or anything that resembles it. Just buy bug spray.
"
Jonathan Goodell,1.0,2021 13 July,"
After 3 days of use my throat is killing me.  I like to sit on my porch as the sun goes down.  Bought these for the mosquitos, but I guess it works better on hurting humans.No point in having them if you can't be near them.

"
Glen A,1.0,2021 5 August,"
Read the reviews. It’s BS. They don’t work at all. The flies, mosquitos, dragonflies literally landed right on the sticks while they were burning. Seemed to be attracting bugs more than keeping them away.

ChubbyMako,5.0,2021 30 May,"
These lasted over an hour at my house! The product claims only last 40/45 minutes, but I timed these for an hour, and the stick still had some life left. I love a product that exceeds it’s “life  expectancy”! This product works well at our house, We follow the recommendations and make sure we have them every 10 feet in the area that we are in. Now to be fair we are very aggressive treating mosquitos  on our property. We have our property sprayed monthly to control mosquitoes populations around our home, we use mosquito deterrents, candles, and we have mosquito deterring plants around our patio. So by no means are we only using these incense sticks to ward off mosquitoes. As someone who is a mosquito magnet, the combination of these products makes it so I can enjoy being outside, without being swarmed by mosquitoes. These sticks are effective, smell “good”, And are inexpensive. I’ll have one burning by our back door when my kids are running in and out of the backyard just to discourage mosquitos from sneaking in our home. When my dogs are sunbathing I’ll even go in light one for them so that they can enjoy themselves outside. These are a staple in our home during spring and summer, I would definitely recommend if you’re someone who loves being outdoors, but doesn’t love being covered in bug bites!Thanks for reading, hope this review is helpful!
"
Honey Bunz,4.0,2021 7 June,"
These works great for small areas or where the wind is non-existent. They have helped but they dont completely solve the problem either. But for what they are they do work better than expected and smell great.
"
BackyardGardener,5.0,2021 16 June,"
We've been using this out under our covered patio.  I filled a couple of clay pots with sand, and sat them at either end of the patio.  When we are outside, I will stick these in the sand and light them - sometimes one, sometimes both depending on the weather and how many flies or bugs we see.  I decided to measure the burn time on one today...it's not windy, and it's in the shade.  It's been going for one hour now, and has about 3/4"" left.  The scent is lemon/citrus/smoke and is very pleasant.  We don't see any mosquitoes, flies, bees, etc. when we have them burning.  I will definitely order these again.
"
NonnaDonna,5.0,2021 22 July,"
Each lighted stick lasts about an hour.  Three lighted sticks kept the flying insects away from our backyard deck.  Scent is more pleasant than a citronella candle.
"
Angie M.,5.0,2021 1 June,"
This smelled like regular incense. I was able to eat outside without getting bit by mosquitos and without flies getting onto my food so I’ll take it!  It worked for me!Easy to light and lasted a decent amount of time - it stayed burning the entire time we ate.Exactly as described and serves it purpose.
"
Nuk,5.0,2021 25 May,"
I do love this.  I started with citronella cones, those tiny pyramids but just burn around 20 to 25 minutes.  This is a much better deal.  You get a stick that burns much longer but not less in smoke.  It is also a great value.  It comes with a wooden stand, but honestly, it is better to just use a masking tape and you can stick it anywhere.  It is great that it also stops burning once it reach the bare stick.  It also works great for repelling insects and mosquitos.
"
Albert Fortner,5.0,2021 19 June,"

"
D'harans,1.0,2021 3 July,"
I have lit about 8 of these little incense sticks, 4 of them lit within 10 seconds of holding them within a constant flame, while 3 of them needed 20 seconds to begin to burn. The last one did not light. The plume (wisp of smoke) is tiny and takes awhile to saturate the area you will be sitting in. After sitting in the 'treated area' you can prepare yourself to be bitten. I have counted 6 mosquitos that I have seen in the last 15 minutes, and I am itching, likely from unseen mosquitos, on my thighs and ankles. I literally placed 4 sticks next to my foot. The same leg has been bitten, making me feel the repellent is actually an appetizer and I am the main course.
"
hj,2.0,2021 10 August,"
These just don’t work as well as the ones I usually get that are a little more expensive (Murphy’s). They also don’t smell as pleasant. I’ll be going back to the others.
"
Adam Machanic,2.0,2021 25 July,"
Very pleasant smelling incense. I looked down at one point and watched a mosquito literally fly right through the smoke -- just before it landed on my leg and bit me.Two stars, because it smells nice. Doesn't work at all.
"
J,5.0,2021 29 September,"
If you have ""The Blood"", you know. Dozens of giant swells in minutes, DEET is your favorite flavor of ice cream, you have bought every spray, fogger, fan, on the market and if someone leaves an upturned bowl in the yard you expel them from your family.Tonight I sprayed myself in my backyard liberally with 20% Deet after getting about 6 bites in 5 minutes. I lit 4 of these in an occult circle around myself and... not a bite for 30 minutes, after a bit I notice 3 new bites on my elbow and see them swarming... The circle of protection has extinguished!I relight 4 new ones and am back to enjoying the outdoors.I just bought 4 more packs, I have never owned a product that actually works before! Amazing.
"
energy101,5.0,2021 16 September,"
I burn these stink sticks when I'm sitting next to my pond in the backyard. The mosquitoes come out of the bamboo and harass me. I'd rather not wear insect repellent, so these are awesome. I think they actually smell really good.
"
Ree,1.0,2021 3 October,"
I have been using items like these for years and never had any issues or concerns.  Each evening I would check before going inside to make sure there was no more smoke being emitted. On 9/30/21 my deck burned very slowly over night.

Works pretty good
"
Delores,5.0,2021 17 November,"
These work great for the mosquitos in the island just too small. Burn out fast so you have to light more and they go fast. The first ones I got last year from a different company was much durable bigger and last longer just one stick
"
Walt,4.0,2021 9 September,"
Easy to use and they work.
"
SS,5.0,2022 2 September,"
Easy to put a few out around the yard while playing and drastically reduced the number of mosquito bites my kids ended the day with
"
Tammyopus,4.0,2022 29 September,"
I use these when camping and I was shocked that they actually worked. They don't last very long though. Smells great. I use a little bucket with pebbles in it to hold them. I wish they came with a stand but my bucket works well enough.
"
Susan,3.0,2021 10 December,"
This did not work to discouraged our Texas size mosquitoes
"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2021 28 July,"
It didn’t work to keep the mosquitos away.  The smell is awful & makes me sick to my stomach.  Had to go inside to get away from the smell.  So maybe that’s how it works, gets you to leave the mosquito area & go inside.  The flies & mosquitos didn’t seem bothered by the smell, only the humans.
"
M. St James,5.0,2022 27 September,"
These don't last a real long time but they smell great and...I didn't see any mosquitos around so...thumbs up!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 29 August,"
I’ve tried sprays and candles but this is the best product and my go to for the future!
"
Fad S,1.0,2021 17 August,"
They don't work. Mosquitos were flying near them. Useless
"
Tamika Jones,5.0,2021 25 August,"
I love to sit outside but lately the mosquitos have been so bad. I got this about 2 weeks ago and I use 2 a day and place them under my chair outside. I also bought the wooden incense holder for sticks and I must admit, no more mosquito bites while sitting outside. They last about 30 minutes. I love them so much until I went back and ordered 4 more packs.
"
Brittany,3.0,2021 8 August,"
The product dose work.  When I light the sticks up I normally do two or three.  They don’t cover very much space.  And don’t last as long as I had hoped for.  There must be a better alternative.
"
Amy S.,1.0,2022 30 June,"
I have bought product of this nature in the past that worked super well. This is nothing more then incense and provides the bugs with a nice ambience as they feast on you. This is your warning stay away from these they don't work.
"
L. Diaz,5.0,2022 17 July,"
I was skeptical at first, but these actually work. I get huge, swollen reactions to mosquito bites so I tried to avoid them at all costs. I light these up in my back yard so I can enjoy being outside and they actually keep the mosquitoes away. I’m not sure exactly how long it lasts after the incense goes out but these give me at least a few hours mosquito free at a time during each use.
"
faye crain,5.0,2022 6 July,"
it works good
"
Angie,5.0,2021 2 October,"
I liked how easy it was to use.. Seemed to do the job. And smelled great! Thanks!
"
Richard ashby,5.0,2021 23 July,"
Lit 2 sticks and sat them outside, about 12 feet apart for 10 minutes and it works, didn't get bit one time
"
Lori McGuire,5.0,2022 5 July,"
If mosquitoes love you this is for you! Plus you don’t have to remember to blow out your citronella candle and you can take these anywhere!

Friendly buyer,4.0,2021 22 July,"
So far so good
"
92fs Kat,5.0,2021 29 October,"
Surprisingly nice smell. It’s got a mild Incense smell. It burns faster than I expected. But keeping the mosquitoes away is the most important feature. So far it’s working.
"
Greg levriett,5.0,2022 26 August,"
They work good!!!
"
Kady Halbmaier,5.0,2022 7 October,"
Our back yard is riddled with mosquitoes so we purchased several items to help us - these are great! I will say with a dog we had to watch a bit closer so he didn’t burn himself but they work well! Wish they lasted a bit longer but do the job we needed.
"
Erica ,5.0,2022 26 August,"
They were easy to stick up out of the ground around our camp site. Wish they lasted a little longer. But I believe they did the trick I used about 7 around our campsite each time they ran out I set up more.
"
Tonia P,5.0,2022 16 June,"
The scent is better than expected. Smell great! And keeps mosquitoes away! Love it.
"
Nicky Nicole Gets It Sold,5.0,2022 8 June,"
These incense work as advertised. I like them.
"
Melanie Howie,5.0,2022 31 May,"
I didn't think these would work but figured it couldn't hurt to try. All I know is that I get bit like crazy without them and I don't get bit at all with them. There's a mosquito nest in my neighbor's yard (I still have bite scars all over from last summer) so I'm convinced these are actual magic in a stick. I've tried so many things but these actually work, I've reordered them several times now, they're officially a necessity.
"
SEMTsensei,5.0,2022 21 July,"
Love the scent, easy to stick into the ground, unobtrusive and subtle.
"
Taylor,5.0,2022 19 April,"
They work great, I plan to buy more, the only downfall is you have to use 3-4 at a time AND they only last around 45mins to an hour. So for my active family, I will be making an alternative in addition to this.
"
B,5.0,2022 19 September,"
Keeps the mosquitoes away

My daughter had gotten some, they worked so well I ordered for my house.
"
Princess Kauzlarich,4.0,2021 4 October,"

"
Jennifer Buffa,5.0,2021 16 September,"
they have a pleasant scent and seem to work for Me....my husband did get 1 bite but who know when he got itbut I like them
"
db,5.0,2022 20 October,"
I’m glad I didn’t listen to the bad reviews . Needed to try something so I bought them and these things work !!! I use them in my workshop and on the porch no more bites .
"
DBTA,5.0,2021 12 August,"
I was happily surprised by the efficacy of this product. I absolutely hate wearing bug spray so i went on the hunt to find an alternative. And boy did i hit the jackpot! Just light it and stick it in a flower pot or anywhere you want. In thrilled. I highly recommend this to everyone I know.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 27 November,"
Nothing really burned faster then stated but did the job

"
Meri,5.0,2022 17 August,"
I didn’t know citronella incense sticks even existed, until I went down some Amazon rabbit hole! Not only, are they right up my alley, but they truly work! I just bought my second box! I typically get eaten alive, but love sitting outside. It’s really buggy, especially when it’s muggy here, despite that I live in Brooklyn! The scent isn’t too irritating either!
"
Herons,5.0,2022 16 July,"
It may not kill insects, but approx 12 hours after burning a stick in the garage I found a nasty palmetto bug lying on his back waiting for an exterminator!
"
Pinklady,5.0,2021 31 May,"
Easy to use.  Very pleased.  The scent is amazing.  They burn well too.
"
Lisa Carmody,5.0,2021 7 July,"
Work great for keeping mosquitos off the deck. Smells fantastic. I like that the stems are skinny so they fit in an incense holder, unlike some other brands that are too thick.
"

Works well, and you don’t have to worry about a flame blowing out.

i tried alot of things, no more mosquitoes. i took this to Pakistan since there were a lot of flys. just to check if it will work on flys and omg! no flies no mosquitoes this is amazing. and i only put on one and the entire radius was mosquito and fly free. amazing product will buy forever
"
JOSE MANUEL ORTIZ,5.0,2021 13 September,"
It is excellent to repel mosquitoes at night
"
John R. Boyett,5.0,2021 7 October,"
They work great. I use them in a warehouse setting with a big mosquito population. These sticks keep them at bay. They burn long and smell great. I'm on my fourth box.  They'd be great for backpacking and camping also.
"
Deedrah,1.0,2021 26 July,"

Runs a little faster than usual. Scent is too strong.
"
Cynthia ,5.0,2022 15 June,"
Life savers when camping.. the mosquitos and bugs were everywhere, and they all disappeared within a couple minutes of using the incense… we lit up 3 around the area and they lasted about 45 minutes..  the scent was not bad, it definitely smelled like bug repellent but it wasn’t unbearable.. 10/10 recommend
"
Fermin,5.0,2021 28 October,"
Work's great
"
Kristen Green,4.0,2021 16 July,"
Smells great, burns for about 30-45 min, depending on wind.Now, does it keep the bugs away? Not really. But it definitely helps. My friend is a mosquito magnet, and she said she noticed a difference as she ""only got bit 2 times VS the 8+ infinity, she is used to"" when we hang on the back porch.
"
Daisy,5.0,2021 18 August,"
Easy to lite
"
Cher56,5.0,2021 5 September,"
I hang them by my front door. I use two at a time during bad mosquito season. It keeps them away from my door. Good smell.
"
HANDLE LESS ,5.0,2022 20 June,"
Incense are thin hoping they were bigger and longer like ones I got from $tree
"
Amazon Customer,2.0,2022 21 June,"
I've had these for over a month. I cannot swear by these because there is no proof that they work indoor or outdoor. I have tried both and I still get bit by mosquitos. I have to light regular citronella and these for the best effect. These Florida insects don't care about these chemicals! To seem effective you'd need at least 20 burning at one time and that just doesn't make sense to do unless it's for a one day event.
"
Juan M. Hernandez,5.0,2021 10 October,"
Great scent, works too.

These actually work when you place them in several locations around the patio or where you are visiting.

Justina,5.0,2022 16 July,"
Seems to work best with couple at a time surrounding the area, I definitely see a difference in how much I’m bitten by mosquitos and scent is not too strong or unpleasant.
"
Ruby Ellen,5.0,2021 5 October,"
Thank you - always looking for something that is not as strong and almost toxic than the citronella candles - this is great incense
"
"mwgilbert, az",5.0,2021 8 November,"
These are WONDERFUL!  Have had so much trouble with mosquitos on our front porch and in our yard. Used these on Halloween for the first time and they worked perfectly. The smell is really soft and pleasant and not a mosquito in sight!  Such a simple solution. I’ll definitely be buying more.
"
Hedieh,5.0,2021 18 July,"
I will get more, real lemongrass
"
Tracy,5.0,2022 10 February,"
Work great!
"
Pat O,5.0,2021 22 October,"
We have a very heavy mini mosquito problem here. These seem to do the trick when I use them next to my night stand. I haven't woken up with more than two bites in the last several nights. Usually I will have six or seven.
"
Lay S.,5.0,2022 7 July,"
So far so good...kept mosquitoes away from me!  Will buy again.
"
Shannon D,4.0,2022 3 August,"
These sandals are everything you expect from Reef. Really comfortable, no ridged edges, superior arch support. But maybe they really are meant to be worn just in the sand.... They have zero traction. Wood, vinyl, tile floors etc are an adventure. The flip flops are nice enough looking to wear to my office on Fridays, but let's just say I wore them there once and won't again. Welp!!
"
Gertrude Nichols,5.0,2022 6 October,"
They are good quality

"
Caitlin,4.0,2022 22 August,"
Clearly high quality but very uncomfortable between my toes. Returned.
"
Stone Pony,5.0,2022 27 August,"
I like these because they’re very comfortable and can go with many type of outfits. The woven Gibson a little bit dressier Feil and then the Reef label lends a more casual flair They are very comfortable! I also got them on sale so another big plus.
"
Madelyn Wray,5.0,2022 25 August,"
These Reef flip-flops are super comfortable and will mold to your feet. Nice quality and very durable for the beach or just a lot of walking. I have plantar fasciitis, and I find that these particular thongs don’t irritate my feet. They’re worth every penny.
"
Sue McCue,4.0,2022 20 July,"
Pretty, but no good support, I can only where for a few hours.
"
JAMES FRIERSON,4.0,2022 16 June,"
I like the flip flops. I like the support. After reading the reviews I ordered one size larger and they fit perfectly. I ordered white but they are more of a natural color. They are not stretchy at all.  I hope they stretch out a little.
"
Diana Frye ,4.0,2022 12 April,"
I read a lot of complaints and I read between the lines. I’ve had Reef flip flops before and I had to order one size up. Same with this pair. They are very comfortable and the arch hits me in the right spot. One person complained that these are slippery and that is the case. I don’t wear these in the house, so it’s not an issue for me but even after wearing them outside for a couple of months, they are still slippery on the rare occasions that I wore them in the house. Which is why I gave these 4 stars
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 26 August,"
These are my favorite flip flop and they are so comfortable. My last pair last me 3 years so they are definitely worth the money!
"
Travelingrn,5.0,2022 31 July,"
I wear these shoes basically every day. I have been exceedingly pleased with their durability and continued comfort. The foot bed has molded to my feet (I have very high arches), and the straps have remained sturdy without unraveling. I have worn these around the house, yard while gardening, walking outside in water, streams, while 4 wheeling, while fishing, while jet skiing, etc etc. they. Are. Awesome.
"
S. Hobson,4.0,2022 19 May,"
I was sad to have to return these. They were well cushioned and had great arch support but run really small. I'm usually between a 9.5-10 so I sized up and ordered a 10. My heels were hanging over the sandal... Disappointing.
"
Lisa M,4.0,2022 24 May,"
I wear a size 10 and have a regular width. These could’ve been a half size larger and a tad wider. Other than that they’re comfy like all other Reef flip flops I’ve owned.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2022 8 June,"
Shoe runs small, I’m a true 9 and had to reorder a size 10. Shoe feels great, very comfy
"
Dawn,5.0,2022 18 August,"
Comfy, and easy to walk around in. My feet normally hate me because I walk until they hurt, but these REEF flip flops are awesome.

"
Monica W.,3.0,2022 31 August,"
Ordered size 9 and were too small. I gave them to my daughter instead, she wears size 8 and they fit her perfectly. She loves them, they're very comfy and light.
"
E. Sliwinski,5.0,2022 18 July,"
These are my go to summer flip flops. Cushioned sole is very comfortable, starts to mold to your foot after a few wearings. Wider band keeps your foot in place and doesn’t irritate my skin. I wear them a lot and they lose their cushion after a season so I replace the next year
"
alexis,5.0,2022 6 August,"
My husband was always telling me that Reef flip flops are great so I had to try them. For $20 they are great. Comfortable and not slippery to walk in.
"

"
Savana Byrne,3.0,2022 4 May,"
I'm 7 months pregnant and have naturally wide and flat feet. I usually wear a 7.5-8 wide. My last 3 pregnancies, I purchased size 8.5 wide or 9 regular shoes to help with swelling in the summer, so I purchased these in a 9.For one, they're the perfect length, so definitely go up 1-1.5 sized when purchasing these.For two, they're very narrow, and my pinki toes sit on the very edge, almost falling over. So if you have wide feet, maybe go up 1.5-2 sizes.For three, the straps are rough, and very tight. I included a picture of what my foot looked like after 1 hour on my feet. I could feel them scratching with evert step.BUT the support is super nice, and I'm going to try to wear them a few hours a day for the next week to see if they losen up. If not, I'll put them away till after baby.
"
Kandice Henry,4.0,2022 5 May,"
Narrow and run a little small. I think they may stretch out so I’m going to keep them…but probably wouldn’t buy again

They fit true to size. Are extremely comfortable and stylish. These are my favorite brand of flip flops and the price was excellent! Definitely a great buy!
"
Diane F.,3.0,2022 23 July,"
I was extremely disappointed. According to the description these flip flops had arch support. If it’s there, I can’t feel it. Not worth the money I paid for them. They feel like I’m walking on a cheap piece of rubber when they’re on. And they’re extremely difficult to put on. Sorry I didn’t return them.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2022 19 May,"
very comfortable
"
Andrea Beltran,5.0,2022 24 June,"
I have these in white and I’ve had them for 4 plus years! Ordered in black and they’re still the same! Reef…don’t change a thing on these!!! Comfy, Cushiony & Supportive! If they had them in more colors, I’d buy them too! ❤️
"
Scifichic,3.0,2022 27 July,"
I nearly fall pretty much every time I wear these.. inside, outside.. doesn’t matter. The bottom of these flip flops are so smooth it’s such a hazard!!

I buy reef flipFlops all the time and this pair I received seems cut really small the strap cut into my arch of foot
"
Kristin K.,3.0,2022 18 July,"
Great flip flop and super comfy.  But I ordered a size five, and while packaging said size 5 one shoe is a 6 and one shoe is a 7.  Not happy.
"
Tiffany,3.0,2022 20 March,"
I ordered these because the ones I bought brand new from a yard sale 2 years ago were wearing down. I wear them nonstop so they have been put through the ringer including getting wet multiple times. When I received these the label on the package said it was from the returns dept. But I thought no biggie because they were brand new looking. They are just as comfortable as my old ones but the sole on the bottom Is so slick that I've almost fell several times.  My other ones never had that problem and they are so worn you can't even see the imprint anymore. I wish I knew why this was a problem because I love these shoes.
"
TGarcia,3.0,2022 1 July,"
Love the shoe itself... comfortable right out of the box... problem is on right foot the front end keeps flipping under my foot while walking... has caused me to stumble several times and now has a split in the footbed...
"
Amanda Greif,5.0,2022 17 May,"
These give great arch support for a flip flop! If I don't have proper support, my back hurts when walking or standing. My back does not hurt in these! After reading reviews, I sized up one and I'm glad I did. There is no way my normal size would have fit!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 15 June,"
I have been dealing with foot problems for months and only been able to wear Brooks running shoes.  I needed a soft and supportive flip flop and these are great!
"
RaeAnn Calce,5.0,2022 30 April,"
I get myself a new pair every season because I wear them literally all the time. Plus my lab and wolf are fond of them as well. Love the support super comfy and they stay like that for a long time. I always have to order a size up but other than that they're perfect.
"
M Hill,5.0,2022 26 June,"
Really like the comfort of these!  I did size up from an 8 to a 9 and was glad I did.

"
Amanda S. ,2.0,2022 29 July,"
I absolutely fell in love with these. The look, support, comfort. They are my favorite flip flops. They were exactly what I was looking for. Have never made my feet sore. I've had a pair of Reefs flip flops for about 4/5 years and they are still in pretty good condition. These unfortunately are breaking down SO fast. I only wear them 2 or 3 days out of the week. I got them about a month ago. The strap has loosened more than I expected too. And I'm only 110 lbs. I had high hopes. I don't review items until I actually know what the product is like. I really hope these last the rest of the summer.
"
Lisa S.,5.0,2022 26 April,"
I have been wearing these sandals for over 10 years.  I buy 2 pair at a time (especially when they are at a good price!)  I certainly hope they don't stop making this particular style.  LOVE THEM!  LOVE REEF!
"
Meg,3.0,2022 19 March,"
These are comfortable shoes but unfortunately run small. I usually wear a 6-6 1/2 so I originally ordered a 6. They were a little tight. But no big deal I’ll exchange them. I had to order a 7 because they don’t have 1/2 sizes and they’re too tight as well. Not so much that I can’t wear them but still… I have really small feet and if these weren’t labeled as a size 7 I’d honestly swear they were the same size 6 I ordered the first time.
"
Dustin King,5.0,2022 8 June,"
I love these but definitely upsize x2. I wear a seven. I ordered an eight. Now wishing I would have ordered a nine.
"
SGard,5.0,2022 19 June,"
Perfect fit with a little support.  Super comfortable and holding up well to daily wear.
"
dimples,3.0,2022 10 May,"
The bottoms are like nylon on outer sole and I slip all the time. Quit wearing them. Paid a lot, didn't notice since I am usually on carpet or cement. Forget wood or tile floors.
"
Suzanne,5.0,2022 27 June,"
Comfortable and lightweight.
"
DENA MARIA,5.0,2022 12 March,"
Super cute, super comfortable. Walked 2+ miles the first day in them. Not sure how stretchy they are, as they are new. Honestly I do not want them to stretch at all. I am a size 9, bought the 9. They are a true fit.
"
Bee,3.0,2022 26 May,"
They are comfy.  Just wish they wouldn’t leave my feet black. None of my others do that.
"
Jon Purple,2.0,2022 10 September,"
Bought these for my wife, she loved them! But with normal wear the sole began separating from the sandal!! Very disappointing, at the price I expected so much more. Have loved other reef flip flops for me and my wife, but avoid these!!
"
Angela M. Ash,5.0,2022 27 April,"
I love these sandals but WARNING do not wear in the sand! The sand got caught in the mesh and chewed up my feet. 😟
"
Jeanie Stewart,3.0,2022 14 April,"
I usually wear a 7 1/2 in most shoes. But I bought in a nine just because I have never bought this brand before. Glad I did because they are almost too small.
"
NIkNik,3.0,2022 10 March,"
Well.. The footbed of them are comfortable, but one sandal is not braided right, it’s extremely tight and it digs in between my toe.. I’ve tried to stretch it, but no luck. I’m bummed cause I was going to order a second pair if they were comfy..
"
kerr,2.0,2022 19 September,"
The item was too small for me. I had to return it. However, the item seemed comfortable and it came as discretion. Unfortunately it was a bit too small for me.
"
Sam,3.0,2022 7 June,"
Too small
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2022 8 April,"
The fit is tighter than reefs I’ve had before, but once on they’re comfortable. They’re dangerously slick on hardwoods though. If I hadn’t worn them already they’d be going back.
"
nicole olivelli,3.0,2022 28 May,"
Runs small
"
Whitney Rahfeldt Schneider ,4.0,2021 6 September,"
I’ve ordered these a few times, but this time they came in smaller then normal. (I usually just click re order, hence knowing it’s not an order issue) however, they still mostly fit.
"
Kelly Byrne,5.0,2018 2 August,"
These have to be the softest, most comfortable flip flops I've ever owned. I had their Reef Zen Wonder sandal and LOVED them, but I think they discontinued them because you can't find them in any size other than 6 anywhere on the interwebs. So I did some research and came up with these as a substitute hoping they would be as comfortable as the Zen Wonders. WOW. It's like walking on pillows. They're fantastic. The only complaint I have is that they seem a little bit tight in the mesh strap area, but I'm sure that will loosen up over time wearing them. They're not uncomfortable tight, just tighter than I would have expected. I don't know if they make a wide in this shoe, but if your feet run wide, I would look into that. My feet are not wide, and they felt super snug. But other than that, these are heavenly to walk in. And while I have another pair of Reef sandals, the Sandy Sandal, that are very slippery inside on our slate floors, the Cushion Threads are just fine and do not slip at all. I saw another review noting how slippery they are and I haven't found that to be the case with these (as it is the case with the Sandy Sandals). Get them. You won't regret it!

I think the bottom is more plastic than rubber and it slips on many surfaces, but the look is pretty

E. Myers,4.0,2020 18 May,"
The o my flip flops I’ll buy are Reefs because of the arch support they give, but also because every pair I’ve owned has lasted for years at a time. I have a some what wide foot so I always have to go up a size when purchasing a pair. I typically wear an 8, but a 9 fits better. I do find though that these run small, so even if I didn’t have a slightly wide foot, I would still need to go up a size.Once you wear them a couple times and break them in, they’re very comfortable.
"
Lacey S.,2.0,2022 27 July,"
I have almost fallen several times! Had I not worn them outside already, I would have returned them. The rubber on the bottom is covered with some kind of fabric, making it very slick on some surfaces.
"
Sara G,3.0,2022 23 April,"
Runs very narrow
"
Lindsay B,4.0,2020 21 July,"
These sandals have received a lot of wear and tear from me, but they are still holding strong. I took down one star because they are not great when wet and get water logged and then take a long time to dry. I don't know about you, but when I'm wearing flip flops they are more than likely going to get wet at some point. They are still comfy and great for wearing around the house, but forget it if you want to water plants or go to the pool.
"
Nikki Breland,5.0,2020 24 July,"
I would add a picture, but my adorable puppy ate them already.. and I’m going to have to order another pair! I loved these flip flops. They were so comfy. I have 9.5 feet. The 9’s fit great. I always get 9’s in Reef and have never had an issue. They have just the right amount of room around the foot for support and my very long toes don’t go over the edge. 10’s leave too much room in the back! I have narrow feet, but also bunions. These felt very secure, not too tight. I thought the material would be stiff or loose, but it was perfect and very soft. Reef never disappoints!
"
Amy O,4.0,2020 2 May,"
These sandals are super cute but are a bit more narrow than other similar sandals I own. Typically I wear a size 9 but the size nine in this sandal has my toes barely fitting. I have normal size toes. 🤣 My only real concern is that there is no grip on the bottom. They are super slippery on my hard wood floors and at a grocery store it was difficult to keep my footing. I’m hoping after wearing them on sand and concrete they will work better.
"
Oceangrrrl,5.0,2020 16 July,"
I am a huge fan of the Reef Butters, but this is the second time I have been made aware that they aren’t available.  So I decided to give two different Reefs a try, and these are not only super cute, but they are extremely comfortable as well, especially compared to that other pair I had ordered.  The bands are very comfortable and securely hold my feet to the sole of the sandal.  I want these in another color!  They’re cute, nice enough to wear casual or out, and just surprisingly great overall!  Still not my Butters though.  ☹️Update.  I bought them in black too!!!
"
Jeri C.,5.0,2021 11 March,"
These sandals were just what I was looking for - they look like sandals from a few years back, which is exactly what I wanted.  The footbed is supportive, and the knit straps with the soft ribbon for in between the toes is perfect.  I think I am going to want other colors.  They definitely do not run large.  I always wear a size 6, but these could be just a bit larger than they are, though I'm sure they will stretch.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2022 8 April,"
So cute and very cushy!
"
Cathy Bogle,5.0,2022 15 January,"
I think it runs a little small so as I got my granddaughter one size up. She loves it. The color is beautiful.
"
Lee,5.0,2021 10 February,"
Attention: reef changed their logo. People need to do research. These are not fake. Goodness. That being said, if you are between sizes, size up to the next whole size. I am anywhere between a size 7-8 in sandals and I ordered a size 8. They fit great. They are very comfortable. I love the wide straps. They are cute basic flip flops and well made.
"

"
Wendy Bauman,2.0,2022 5 June,"
I love Reefs.  Ive had the Gingers for years repeatedly.  BUT If you are looking for something with great traction, these are NOT it.  They are fine outside, but I slide all over my tile floors.
"
Cammy,4.0,2020 8 May,"
I have always loved Reed flip flops and I have always wore a size 9 in any reefs and that has always fit perfectly but these run a 1/2 size smaller, the sole fits like a size 9 but the straps fit like a size 8 1/2, very snug and does not lessen after wearing at all,but they still are a very nice well built flop.
"
Rashel ,4.0,2021 9 February,"
The white is not really white. More like a dingy off white. My flops look like they are dirty when they are clean and new. Otherwise they are great but I wouldn’t buy them again
"
MAS,1.0,2022 23 October,"
These flip flops have no tread - they slide. You will slip and fall. No question. They have a sole that immediately fails: on wood floors, stairs, grass, stone wall ways. A very poor design. Be ready.
"
Mindi,4.0,2020 11 August,"
I love Reef sandals and thought these were so cute! They’re pretty comfortable however the tread on the bottom is weird. It looks like good traction but it’s actually kinda slick. I slip when walking in my house all the time. Hoping with wear outside and on concrete they’ll get better....
"
Blaire,4.0,2020 20 May,"
The reviews are true that these are narrow sandals with a high arch. If u don’t have high arches, it will be painful. But they are thick and squishy and amazing, which is why I took a pair of scissors to the squish and shaved them down so the arch wasn’t killing my feet. Totally worth it. LOL!
"
Melissa Nicol,5.0,2020 15 September,"
Definitely different than previous reefs I have owned but still very comfortable and stylish. Reefs are my absolute favorite flip flops hands down. The footbed is smoother and softer and the reef logo changed so it seems like they may be fakes at first but after doing some research it looks like Reef changed their logo? Still not sure but they have been great so far! Do run a little small and need to stretch a little
"
Elizabeth Norris,4.0,2020 17 June,"
Ordered these for my best friends birthday.  Disappointed that i ordered them on a Friday and recovered them the following Wednesday with prime.  Women’s reefs run a tad bit small so i sized up and they fit her perfectly. She wears an 8 and i got her a 9.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2020 19 June,"
I was very pleased with these discounted Reefs.  Yes, I believe they really are legit Reefs, but I suggest ordering a 1/2 to a whole size up. I always wear a size 8 and the are almost too short for comfort, but I will keep them for the price.
"
KMharford,4.0,2020 22 May,"
The length was okay, but they were a bit tight across the strap. The strap rubs right under my arches. Kept them hoping they will break in.  However, they are slippery.  I've been using sandpaper on the sole to try to get a grip. Not worth the $42 price range.
"
Genn,4.0,2020 9 June,"
These are extremely comfortable.  Not the support I was looking for.  My biggest issue is they are slippery on floors.  I have tried everything to scratch up the bottom of the shoe.  Having problem with my platner fastest makes walking around the house a little uneasy.
"
Sonnet Chase,4.0,2020 8 July,"
Cute sandals and the fit and comfort are good, the only reason I gave them a 4 instead of 5 star is because they are a bit slippery on some surfaces.  A few times I have almost fell on my booty when walking on certain surfaces.
"
ELF,3.0,2020 12 May,"
I have worn reef flip flops for years and love them.  These look really nice but there are two small issues with them.  They run VERY narrow. Luckily I have pretty narrow feet but the blue yarn hits the bottom of my feet not to the side which makes them a little less comfortable.  Second issue is that the bottom of the shoes are very slippery on most surfaces (none of my other Reefs are.)  I have tried to scuff them to make them less so, but have almost slipped a few times when they didn't catch on the floor.  I'll keep them but wouldn't likely choose them had I known these issues.
"
Briggs,5.0,2020 20 May,"
Every year I get a new pair of Reef sandals.  I’ve never had a pair wear out, I just like to get a new style each summer.  These are by far my favorite Reef’s!  The style caught my eye immediately...they are clean looking, cute and will match many different outfits.  What I was not expecting, however, was how comfortable they are.  The cushioning on bottom is wonderful.  I can’t wait to wear them...after I get a long overdue pedicure!
"
Sound traveller,5.0,2021 21 October,"
Love these they don’t show dirt on the foot pad and super soft great fit! Had a pair that I needed to replace.
"
HollyA,4.0,2020 13 August,"
Comfortable and nice looking. Not for wide feet but good fit otherwise. The bottom is slippery which i found surprising. I was even slipping on a dry, wooden boardwalk in NJ. This is the reason for 4 not 5 stars.
"
jas7273,5.0,2021 3 November,"
So much better than thin strap flip-flops.  I now have 2 pair - black and tan weave
"
Janie,5.0,2021 15 June,"
Love these, they are so comfortable. Sole is so soft. There is arch support also.  I wear a 6.5 so I ordered the 7.  It fits perfectly.  You may want to size up and it may run slightly narrow.
"
Joseph,5.0,2020 28 November,"
Very comfortable, cushiony flips.  Runs small so order up! Look at size chart and measure your feet.  A word of caution to those who are accident prone, they are strangely slippery on smooth floor surfaces.  They've held up well through one summer so far.  When they do wear out I'll definitely buy them again.
"
L H.,4.0,2020 29 July,"
Nice looking and very comfortable, but narrow.  I wear a medium width and these fit my feet exactly., no room to spare. So if you like your fit a little loose, be prepared for a narrow fit.
"
KTH,5.0,2021 10 October,"
So comfortable and affordable this time. Reef are my favorite flip flops and I am really happy with this purchase.
"
Hannah,5.0,2020 9 June,"
So these shoes are very narrow which I have size 11 narrow feet so they fit me perfectly. These shoes definitely need a break in period, but afterwards they are so comfy. The part where the fabric for the strap goes in the shoe has a little hump and that hurt my footFor a while but after wearing them none stop for about a week they are great.
"
Ann,4.0,2017 18 July,"
The reef cushion threads are nice sandals . I am keeping them for looks . I prefer the sandy sandal the best. I found the tape in these sandals to be a bit more tight in the fit in both pair that I bought. However that said .., it is a good sandal to wear anywhere with a more sleek look. For all day hard wearing I'd still choose the sandy sandal. I am keeping the two pair I bought. I bought six pair of reefs and will be collecting more of the sandy sandals as they are my absolute favorite .
"
jennifer l gasner,4.0,2020 3 August,"
Like walking on a cloud. I love the thickness of the straps, they cover the areas of my foot like my baby toe - the dreaded not so picturesque toe. I bought the cream color.
"
C. E. Parah,2.0,2022 13 April,"
These reef flip flops are not like any of my other reefs, I could barely get my foot in them they are so narrow. If you have a narrow foot they will probably work for you.
"
omi,5.0,2021 23 April,"
This is my second pair of this exact kind of shoes although my first ones for pot in my second ones with what I have found that the black pair seem to rub black off on math feet
"
Nicole Putnam,3.0,2021 26 June,"
Has great support but the top is very small. Makes it hard to wear. I’m sure if i wore them more they would have stretched but i didn’t have the patience after lightly wearing them for half a day.
"
Jaypaps,3.0,2020 16 October,"
The sole of this sandal needs to be re-engineered.  You can slip and slide on almost any surface very easily, I almost fell a few times.  When I wear these indoors I have to shuffle instead of step, that's how slippery they are.  Also the sole is too mushy, and not firm enough.  Other than that they are comfortable and fit well, true to size.
"
Audra Salisbury ,5.0,2021 1 June,"
Sadly we had to return them. They are too small to go over my step daughters feet. She is only 10 and the size 5 we a little long but still too tight.
"
Mair K,4.0,2020 8 June,"
Cannot give a great review because they did not fit my feet. Fortunately, I’m able to give them to my daughter.Ordered a size larger for myself Hopefully they will fit.
"
Ryan Murphy,2.0,2022 23 May,"
Not true to size. I am not impressed with these and I like Reefs.
"
Wendy One,5.0,2020 3 June,"
My foot runs a little wide so it's hard to find shoes in general. I have been loyal to the nike cushioned flip flops but they got expensive and I heard they downgraded the quality. I'm so happy with these. They are comfortable and I like how they look! I hope they hold up for a few summers.
"
B Jett,2.0,2022 3 June,"
Great shoe, but leaving a blister weeks later.
"
Tia,1.0,2019 5 October,"
I’m so bummed out. For the last 5 years, Reefs are the only flip flops I’ve worn. I love how comfy they are and how long they last. I recently spent 1 month traveling Southeast Asia and spent the majority of my time wearing a year-old pair of Reef flip flops. I was so impressed with how well they traveled.I got back to the US and ordered this pair of flip flops in size 7, the same size that I’ve worn for YEARS from this brand. When it arrived, I was surprised that my heel was hanging off the end of the flip flop and that my very narrow feet seemed to be spilling over the sides of the flip flops. I read some reviews which mentioned that Reef sizing had gotten jacked up so I returned the flip flops and ordered a size 8. Now the size 8 have come in and there is about an inch of flip flop off the back of my heel. Or course they don’t make half sizes or I would have obviously ordered a 7.5.I’m just really bummed out that they have changed the sizing. I love this brand and sincerely hope that they go back to the sizing they used before or at least offer half sizing as well. I want to continue to wear Reefs but unfortunately will be returning this pair and won’t be trying to buy any flip flops from them anytime soon.
"
steph,5.0,2020 15 April,"
I love these flip flops. They are super comfy and cute as well.  My dog ate my first pair that I only had for two weeks, so I ordered another one. I was still wearing the first pair as it was still wearable but I wanted another one. As far as I can see, they are very durable as well.
"
Katherine Accomando,5.0,2017 1 July,"
Got 7 years out of my last reefs - looking for another 7 with these bad larrys.Wicked cute flip flops!! I had my last pair of reefs for 7 years and they finally wore out right before a week at the beach- thank goodness for prime shipping! These new reefs have a very comfy, sturdy sandal strap and supportive soles. I love them and the size 9 fits my 8.5/9 feet great. We'll worth spending a little extra bling bling for the quality!!!PS the photo is my bf's janky feet next to my flip flops. Swear I don't got hobbit feet!
"
jeanne,4.0,2020 12 September,"
Good foam bottom,  slippery when wet. And also runs a bit longer then normal on toe and heel.

Sonia Mohammed,4.0,2021 21 January,"

"
Gail Fox,5.0,2021 8 May,"
I live in my Reefs, summer and winter. Some pairs lose the strap from the sole of the shoe but on this one so far so good.
"
PB in SB,5.0,2020 16 May,"
Love these! They truly *fit* my foot. No falling off between steps. Love how the wide strap sits back farther on my instep, which holds the cushy sole in place much better than a typical flip flop. I can see how this style is better suited to a narrower, lower volume foot like mine.
"
signangel,3.0,2021 27 May,"
I have wide feet right below the base of my pinky toe and these sandals looked ridiculous because they're too narrow for me (my foot hangs off the side). However;  they are comfortable.
"
Mark Barilla,2.0,2021 1 April,"
After looking at so many options, I decided to get these. My old pair was Reef brand and I loved them. They finally broke (after wearing them nearly daily for several years). Naturally, I wanted to get another pair. When they arrived, I found them way too narrow. I could not even get my foot halfway into the flip. I don't think that I have ""fat feet"" so I let my daughters try and they couldn't get them on either. I finally shoved my feet in.  Also, they're so slippery--no grip on the bottom at all.  So disappointing. I'll need to return these and try another style.
"
jcbaxter,5.0,2021 26 April,"
I have a narrow foot.  Hard to find flip flops that stay on and aren’t too wide.  These fit me perfectly.  Snug fit and comfortable!
"
Tesla,5.0,2021 22 September,"
These are my favorite sandals. They are so comfortable.
"
LW,3.0,2020 18 June,"
Though cute and comfy, these suckers run really small. Normally I wear a 9, so I ordered a 10 and they were so small I don’t think an 11 would be big enough. I don’t have a skinny foot, but not fat either and I’ve never in my life have worn a wide size, but this is designed for a very thin foot as well.
"
AmyW,5.0,2021 1 April,"
Perfect fit, excellent quality. The arches are perfect and this is a true Reef sandal. Fast shipping, hassle free! Will be doing business with this seller again.
"
jrowan13,5.0,2020 29 June,"
Love these they’re so cute and comfy, if you are in between sizes order the size up (I’m an 8-8.5 and the 9 is what fits). They are a bit slippery on the bottom but I think when they get worn more they’ll build up some traction.
"
Akire,4.0,2019 28 July,"
They are beautiful and feel comfortable, BUT they are narrow and they are not true size. They feel too tight and I forgave wide feet. Also, the back of my feet’s are out a little bit. I returned them to get a bigger size.
"
SkyeAlysa,3.0,2017 2 December,"
This sandal is not appropriate for people with wide feet and it badly proportioned in this way.  The sole and straps are very narrow, and once you order a size large enough to accommodate a wider foot, you end up with an awkward extra length in the toe that become cumbersome.  I am always catching the toe of the sandal on the floor wrong and it causes me to trip frequently.However it is a very comfortable shoe, and i am very pleased with its sturdy construction.  The sole is especially springy.i initially bought this shoe in a size 10 and exchanged it for an 11.

Great flips!  Like walking on memory foam.  The straps are nice adding a little extra detail to a simple flip flop. Bought more in yellow and cream.
"

I saw these sandals on a friend and had to have them.  They are beautiful and fit well too.  I love how comfortable the sole is and the macrame look of the top is just the right touch.
"
Carolyn judge,5.0,2017 29 September,"
I LOVE Reef flip flops. I have a pair I purchased 12 years ago. I have worn them EVERYDAY of the summer for the past 12 years. The only reason I purchased another pair was to finally have 2 pairs. The first pair that I purchased 12 years ago are still in great shape. They mold to your feet and are the most comfortable thing in the world. Everyone should have at least one pair in their collection and I promise you the will be the only pair you grab and wear!!
"
MJB,5.0,2021 5 June,"
They are sandals. Not much support but I didn't buy them for support. I love ""REEF"" sandals.
"
J. Royal,1.0,2022 17 February,"
Was looking for a pair of flip flops to throw on and wear around our pool.  I'm glad I only paid $9 for these b/c they are terrible.  Firstly, they fit really tightly and almost squeeze the top of my foot.  I don't have this problem with other sandals.  Secondly, they are very slippery.  Even walking on wood and tile floors, my feet slip.  Lastly, the arch sits too far back for my foot.  I can't wear Nikes for the same reason - the arch hits my foot too far back so if you have the same problem with Nikes, don't buy these flip flops.
"
Joylenn,1.0,2022 15 August,"
I love the fit of my Reef flip flops but the are so slick to walk on nearly any surface.  This makes them difficult to wear.
"
jennifer,5.0,2020 24 February,"
Stylish and comfortable. I highly recommend these flip flops.  Reef normally runs a bit small so I am usually a size 8 and I wear a 9 in all of their shoes.  Wide band is very comfortable and supportive.  I will be ordering more in other colors now.
"
Audrey Rogers,5.0,2020 15 June,"
I like everything about these flip flops..they look exactly like the photograph. They are very comfortable..however I do feel $40 is a bit pricey for flip flops..I had a gift card and wanted casual shoes in that color so I bought them.
"
AmazinMom4,3.0,2020 24 April,"
So the foam is soft but where the strap hits the foam part it is really narrow and the strap is glued in weird, causing the foam to bump up and cut into the foot. I am hoping with some normal wear it will flatten out. They also have a very obnoxious chemical smell to them.
"
G. Holt,5.0,2020 18 May,"
Have only worn them once and they feel snug but not tight.  I have a wide foot so this is probably not the case for everyone.  I’m sure once they break in they will relax and feel looser(which I like).
"
Hillary,3.0,2021 15 April,"
These fit tight, and do not seem to be breaking in with wear. Hoping the strap becomes softer and more pliable with continued wear
"
A. Barrineau,5.0,2019 22 June,"
I love these!!!  I read the reviews and ordered a size up.  I kinda wish I hadn’t I think the 8 would be fine. The 9 is ok just they are getting looser in the straps as I wear them every day!!  So anyway super soft bottom. I’ve had the cushion before and I am a huge fan.  Very supportive.  Recommend 100%!
"
Michelle,5.0,2017 12 December,"
Reef flip flops with the cloth toe separator are the only flip flops I’ll wear. I always find I have to go down a full size for flip flops and up half a size for boots. So I am a consistent 9 and I always order an 8 in Reef. Also, they stretch out with wear and the sole gets a bit wider and longer as you wear them in, so I always go a size smaller for these reasons.
"
Moskwaka,3.0,2019 26 September,"
I love Reef sandals and have been wearing them for close to 20 years.  This is one of the first pairs that I've ever had that have been significantly too narrow.  Usually they fit like they were made for me but I wore these once and never put them back on.  The aqua color is adorable, just wouldn't recommend if you're used to wearing wider flip flops.
"

Tiffani,5.0,2020 17 March,"
OK I’m a little biased because I love Reefs. But, these have the cushion foam stuff, so they are really comfortable and soft to walk on. Just keep in mind that they’re not really white —they’re light khaki colored. I love them.

I love these reef sandals, I was lucky to be able to get them while they were on sale. They are very supportive especially since I have plantar fasciitis. They are cute and comfortable.
"
 Maria A.,4.0,2019 21 March,"
I had to return them and purchased one size up.( Normally I am size 6, returned them, and got 7). Size 7 works great, they are super comfortable , but they stain your feet black. what a shame.
"
Tiffany Davis,4.0,2020 7 July,"
just sad I lost one. :(
"
Gia,3.0,2020 21 August,"
These are super comfy, but there is absolutely no grip on them. Very very slippery. I don't understand why there isn't some sort of gripping. If you walk on hard floors or in a restaurant with tile, you'll slip.
"
GirlMomma,1.0,2022 15 August,"
I have small narrow feet, I tried to put these on and couldn’t even get my feet into them.
"
WildTurkey,3.0,2020 21 April,"
The fit is a bit smaller than expected but will most likely stretch after wear. The bottom of the shoe provides NO grip whatsoever! I've slipped walking across my floors several times, be careful!!! Very slick, will be dangerous if wet surface or if you walk too fast!
"
Gary,4.0,2020 2 June,"
Buyer beware, the soles are very slick
"
laura santi,5.0,2021 23 March,"
I live in Hawaii, always in”slippers”.There slippers are truly comfortable, and are soo cute!
"
Golf_Girl,5.0,2019 3 September,"
You can never go wrong with reef.  Solid flip flop - nice arch support, thick sole but very forgiving and they retain their shape.  These were a little tighter across the top of my foot but super cute and comfortable!  Reef flip flops are more expensive than others, but they're worth every penny!
"
kellie marcus,5.0,2021 11 June,"
I get so many compliments on these sandals.  So cute.
"
Maggie,3.0,2020 18 June,"
I thought these sandals we’re SO cute and anxiously awaited their arrival! What a let down!! They are way too snug! The length was fine, it was the straps! I could barely get my foot into them! I sadly sent them back.
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2020 14 July,"
Comfy and lightweight
"
Jamie,3.0,2020 6 July,"
I love these BUT they are super slippery. They have absolutely no traction. Being a new mom often walking around the house and on the deck with the baby in hand, I can’t risk wearing these. I slip every time.
"
Sara's Place,3.0,2020 16 May,"
Runs way too small. Order larger. I wear a size 9 and have narrow feet. I ordered a 9 but they were too narrow and ran short. I was SO disappointed! Very comfortable. Cute. Good support. Next time will order size 10 or 11.
"
Amber callicoatte,5.0,2020 4 May,"
My feet swell and I've just had a baby so the size was my fault. The material is great though. Wish they had it in size 9 right now. Gifting it to my small footed mother.
"
MLG,4.0,2018 1 May,"
I want to like these, but they do get squeaky and hot if you're wearing them over a long day or for a lot of walking. They are cute and otherwise pretty comfortable. But flip flops are noisy enough as it is without the squeak!
"
Beth,5.0,2020 18 June,"
I've bought these every year for the last 3 years. They fit great and are so comfortable for all day wear. I have issues with my arches, and they are VERY supportive!
"
Dana,1.0,2022 22 May,"
Ordered size 5. Got them and tried on left shoe and it fit. It's finally warm enough to wear so I got them out and right shoe was very large. Turns out left she is a 5 and right shoe is a 7. Now return window is gone Would like an option to exchange for correct size.
"
Brittany Beshero,5.0,2021 14 July,"
So comfortable and I love the wide strap.
"
Adriana Gomez,2.0,2020 9 May,"
The straps on these sandals are NOT the same size! I know that many people have one foot larger than the other, but I feel my feet are pretty much the same. I’ve never had an issue with other shoes. The Reef sandals are definitely tighter on the right sandal. I even tried the left sandal on my right foot (just in case my foot may have been swollen, for whatever reason) and the left strap doesn’t feel tight at all. I thought I’d wear these for a day- to see if the right strap would loosen, but they were so uncomfortable. I couldn’t take it. They’re going back.
"
svlorelei,3.0,2020 9 May,"
Not the usual Reef flops I’m used to but attractive. Bottoms are a strange material which is slick as in no traction. The straps are a bit loose but I have narrow feet. Good value for the money but not a fav.
"
dale,5.0,2020 1 September,"
These are the most comfortable flip flops!  I wore them on a recent trip to DC (lots of walking!) and they were all I wore!
"
momma_of_2,5.0,2020 28 April,"
I LOVE the aqua pair I ordered and even looked to order more colors but was discouraged to only find them in yellow 🙁. If there were other colors I would definitely buy them!
"
Sandra K,3.0,2020 13 July,"
I purchased reef flip flops in past and they were fine.  This pair is very slippery on many smooth surfaces.  Not happy at all about this.  Hopefully, I won't slip and break something!
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2019 30 May,"
I had a pair of the reef cushion breeze which fit my feet perfectly and I wore until they wore out. I ordered the cushion threads to replace them. They were much more narrow and the straps were a tighter fit than the breezes (though I’m sure in time would have worn in fine). Returning because of the width and going back to purchase what I know.
"
Antoinette ,2.0,2021 17 July,"
Definitely not the real thing. I had a pair of the real reefs and they had great arch support and last probably about 2 yrs and I wear them all the time. This pair is already starting to show wear and tear. The arch support is not even close to the same. Don’t waste your money on these.
"
Delilah,5.0,2020 6 August,"
I love these, they are so comfortable. I am not normally one to buy flip flops with wider straps, but I got these and love them
"
Laura Ferrell,3.0,2020 30 May,"
I would like to love this flip flops, but I can’t. They are very comfortable, but the tread on the bottom is almost nonexistent. I will have to buy something to put in the bottom of these shoes.
"
beth,5.0,2020 22 June,"
I love reefs! My favorite brand of flip flops! This pair is no exception. Very comfortable. I love the support they provide in the arch. The fit is perfect.
"
Lisa Dupuis,5.0,2020 21 June,"
Love the color, the perfect fit, not tight, not loose. Love the arch support. I buy a new pair every year. Love these the best so far.
"
JT,2.0,2020 23 April,"
These are quite narrow and very slippery on the bottom. True to size as far as length. I wear an 8 and the 8 fit. My biggest complaint is the high arch. It feels like a ball under my foot and actually hurts. I would say my foot arch is normal. Not flat or high and I usually don’t have issues, but these are not at all comfortable for me. I do love the squishy feel of the shoe itself. I’m disappointed I will need to return these, but that’s the risk of buying online without being able to try on first.
"
Sarahizzle,4.0,2017 18 July,"
I wear an 8 1/2 so I had to get the size 9 and they fit like a size 9 would on an 8 1/2 foot. They are very cute and comfortable and have gotten a lot of compliments but the crochet straps are a lol loose.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 1 July,"
Recently took a trip to Florida. Perfect fit and hold their shape well. Adorable on the beach or with shorts.  Very comfortable to walk in.
"
joshua shae hatfield,5.0,2021 27 June,"
Fit great, comfy and super cute
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 27 February,"
Fits a little small so I would go 1/2 size up. Incredibly comfortable. Can’t wait to wear them on my cruise. I bought the off white but will be ordering the black pair soon.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 21 May,"
Love them even a year later
"
Robert Neely,5.0,2020 9 August,"
I bought these for my girlfriend. She loves them. They don't slip off your foot. She says they are ""cushion-y"". Very comfortable.
"
David Chavez,5.0,2020 24 August,"
My wife loved the sandals in the off white and brown, so I decided to get her the black ones too.
"
cynthia beam,3.0,2020 12 May,"
If you have wide feet, this shoe is not for you. I even ordered a size bigger and it still snug. The straps feel great and the shoe is soft and nice to walk in.
"
Heather L Griffin,5.0,2020 1 May,"
Ordered these for my Mom due to being home during Covid 19.......she loves them. Says the fit perfectly and have a nice cushion on the bottom. Made Mom smile!!!
"
Charly Perkins,5.0,2020 1 July,"
These are very pretty and very well made. They came in super fast and I am so excited to take them to the beach!
"
Molly32,5.0,2019 24 August,"
Very Cute and comfortable.  I have feet problems by I can were these for short amounts of time with no pain.  I were an 8 in everything but had to size up in these so my heel would not stick out from the sole.
"
SwellGuy,5.0,2020 23 June,"
These flip flops are the perfect summer footwear.  They go with all of my summer outfits, but also are fine in the sand.
"
Paige N.,4.0,2017 11 May,"
So comfortable! I love Reef and plan to wear these all summer.  My feet get swollen easily and these still fit even on a swollen foot day.  They were not too snug and on a normal foot they probably feel perfect.
"
Orenda friend,5.0,2020 18 May,"
Amazing flip flop tha get noticed every time I wear them. Comfortable, great fit, and easy to get in and out of. Just ordered the black
"
nvj3wlv,5.0,2019 26 June,"
Have been wearing Reefs for many years, way many.  Quality remains, price has increased as with everything else, considerably but ordered two pair, two colors.  Last thing I need is more shoes, BUT, so pretty, very nice.  Last forever.
"
CambMA,5.0,2020 7 July,"
Most comfortable pair of reefs I’ve ever owned, and I’ve had a lot! Love the wide soft strap and pretty coral color.
"
cassarl,4.0,2019 29 December,"
I love the comfort and look of these.
"
Sil,5.0,2020 10 September,"
Una compra que valió la pena. Muy cómodas,  importante para el dolor que sentía con las comunes.
"
Phoebe,5.0,2020 25 September,"
Love this pair of sandals so much. Perfect for the beach or a day on the boat
"
Jackie,3.0,2018 3 April,"
I have had over 5 pairs of Reefs in the past and these are not one of my favorites due to the sole which is curved up in the front and back vs flat. My other cushion soles are not like this.  The strap is so soft and I needed them for a trip so I kept them and hopefully they flatten out with wear.
"
Huichun,1.0,2022 3 August,"
It's comfy until you start to notice it's very slippery.
"
Megan,5.0,2018 10 August,"
Reef cushion flip flops are the comfiest flip flops ever invented. I wore these all through out my pregnancy and they were the only thing i could get through the day wearing. The top on these is super soft. They break in to form to your feet and have great arch support.
"
R. D. Mackenzie,5.0,2019 7 May,"
This was a lot of money for me to spend on flip flops but they are SO comfortable. Padded, I feel like I am walking on a cloud. Soft material between my toes instead of rough leather or plastic. Heaven. Bought 2 pairs.
"
Judy ,5.0,2018 16 August,"
Oh my! The most comfortable flip flops I have ever worn. The arch support is wonderful. The cushion when you walk is so nice. The piece that hose between toes is nice and doesn't irritate. I haven't had them very long so time will tell if they will continue to be as cushioned.
"
Nanner,5.0,2020 3 August,"
Everything about these are great. I’ve eorb reefs for years !  Can also be altered by my orthodics.
"
Angela,4.0,2020 7 January,"
great quality but size runs small

it is a substantial sandal.
"
Tania Schellhorn,5.0,2021 9 May,"
Soo comfortable! Love these!
"
ChristinaD,3.0,2020 20 July,"
Love reefs but these didn't fit based on size chart. Ran very small. I like the strap but sizing needs adjusted.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2021 26 May,"
They are perfect
"
True Blue,5.0,2020 3 April,"
Happy with purchase. The coral straps are thicker than expected so it takes a little wiggling of the feet to slide foot completely forward
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 20 February,"
Comfortable & cloth braid helps the air flow. I usually wear 7 1/2 and got these in 7 and they're fine. Thought they might give some being braided
"
Briana Rischitelli,5.0,2020 14 July,"
Love this sandal! I have really bad feet and I can wear these all day! Wicked comfy and supportive.
"
Cynthia C,5.0,2021 11 April,"
Super comfy and cute
"
Cassie t,3.0,2020 2 June,"
These are SO narrow. I can usually put on any sandal and go but these are so much narrower than expected and make it uncomfortable.
"
I H,1.0,2022 19 August,
jeni,5.0,2017 9 August,"
Really comfortable and solid sandals, as expected from Reef. I buy a new pair of Reefs every year and put hundreds of miles on each one. These ones should also stand up well to this test. The straps are a bit thicker than some of the other models, but they're as equally comfortable and well-made as any other pair I've owned.
"
kirsten fitzgerald,1.0,2022 2 August,"
Such cute sandals but broke on first wearing
"
Sydnie Woolcock,5.0,2020 30 May,"
I normally do not like wearing flip flops, but these are so comfortable and soft I wear them all the time!
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2021 13 February,"
Not wide enough toes hang off
"
Jessica Green,2.0,2020 20 June,"
I love Reef flip flops, I have been wearing them for years. These just didn't pass through a decent quality control. They look lovely, and are very comfortable. However, each flip flop strap is very different. One strap fits loosely, the other fits very tight. Either would be fine, I know they eventually stretch out so the tight isn't a bother. But they are so different, that it just feels weird when I walk. It's quite annoying and frustrating.
"
Dani Oates,4.0,2017 7 August,"
These sandals are cute and comfy, but they are incredibly slippery as there seems to be no grip on the sole. I'm contemplating adding something to the bottom to avoid busting my butt.
"
Kristine B.,5.0,2020 1 December,"
My second pair of these, so comfy...even for fat feet ha!
"
Amazon Customer,4.0,2020 16 February,"
Very comfortable,
"
Tricia Atkins,1.0,2022 9 March,"
I wear a size 7,5 normally in shoes sometimes even a 7 but I like a little room on sandals so always order an 8. This 8 feels like a 6 they are super tight, and my foot is hanging off the back. Will be requesting a return. They are comfortable though and good quality like with all reef products.
"
Bobbie Legare,5.0,2020 14 July,"
Love these sandals,  except they are a little tight. I'm hoping the straps will loosen a little.
"
Scott Gray,5.0,2020 22 June,"
I was very pleased on how comfortable they are , and are my go to flip flop now !
"
Jennifer,5.0,2018 17 July,"
Bought these to replace another older pair of Reefs that my dog chewed through. They're so comfortable and fit well. The difference in cushioning and comfort between these and other pairs of sandals is astounding. It's not even close. I'll buy Reefs for the rest of my life!
"
prime shopper man,5.0,2019 17 December,"
These are very comfy. All reef have support in there shoes. That is why i keep going back to them. I don't think there is a bad reef flip flip
"
Gracie Rivera,5.0,2020 16 June,"
I got these as a birthday present and I love them.  They are so comfortable, considering buying another.
"
Ashley Brown,5.0,2018 24 September,"
The last pair of these I had lasted me 13 years of almost daily wear. I tried a different brand after my original reef flip flops finally wore down. The other brand lasted 18months. So I'm back to my favorite and excited to have another pair!
"
Clorissa Tejeda,5.0,2019 8 July,"
Very comfortable!!! I'm normally a size 9 but I ordered a10 after trying on a pair of Reefs at sporting goods store. So I recommend ordering a size up from your normal shoe size. These are super cute sandals!
"
Ashley Dempsey,3.0,2020 18 June,"
The bottoms of these are very comfortable. Unfortunately they run small and are entirely way to narrow for my feet.
"
Kevin Nelson,5.0,2020 12 July,"
My wife loves them. She wears them all day at home. It's helping her flat feet pain.
"
Sveta Alenina,5.0,2019 20 December,"
i was wearing those many month everyt day. On the cold days, as slippers at home. They fell apart on me, but only from my abundant love for them.
"
Debie K.,3.0,2020 29 June,"
the material has stretched already after a couple of wearings, so not they slip off my feet. Disappointing.
"
Martha Cordell,3.0,2021 11 March,"
Perfect support
"
Angela,5.0,2020 5 June,"
I thought these were super cute.. but..I've only wore them 4 times and the whole bottom came off
"
Justin J.,2.0,2020 23 December,"
I've only had these for a year and they haven't held up (not even a daily use). The bottom has separated so I would have to glue the tread back on. I've had other pairs of Reefs for over 20 years and they've stood the test of time so they definitely don't make them like they used to.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2020 17 June,"
Runs a bit small. The bottoms are very slick. I probably will not purchase them again.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2020 22 September,"
Cute, comfy, neutral flip flop can pass as dressier or casual.
"
Sarah,3.0,2020 13 June,"
These flip flops are very narrow. They don’t fit well in width and the strap area.
"
Lisa,5.0,2020 7 July,"
Flip flops with arch support. It’s hard to find shoes anymore with good arch support
"
KELLY,2.0,2018 27 June,"
I am so  disappointed in this pair of reefs.  I have owned multiple pairs of reefs and absolutely loved them. The strap is pulling / fraying after two months with minimal use - worn about half a dozen times.  Amazon return period is up and upon contacting Reef directly I have to pay to return to see if they will even replace.  I have raved about how much I love my Reefs and how comfortable they are - but now I'm afraid to buy another pair.  Be warned these are not what I've come to expect as Reef quality.
"
M Hill,1.0,2022 26 January,"
These seem to only work for people with LONG toes.  The front is quite long while the back is short.  I wear a size 8 and my heal was too close to the back edge but could have gone a size smaller for the front to fit.  This is not the first time I've come across this issue with this brand.  Returning  :(
"
Christine M.,5.0,2018 9 March,"
I have alway loved everything Reef put out for their sandals.  They fit so perfectly and have amazing support for a sandal.  I will never buy any other flip flop from anyone other than Reef.  Amazing Product, always well worth the money.
"
Ann K Darling,3.0,2020 2 May,"
Have to return them. Really cute, but too small, like a whole size too small. Might re-order

These are amazing.  The price is perfect and they last forever. Soft cushioning under the feet. Breathable.
"
Laura,5.0,2017 30 July,"
I love these flip flops. I got a size 10 even though I usually wear size 8.5-9. I had tried on a 9!in the store and it was too small so I knew to order a 10  it fits like a 9 normally would for me.
"
Jason,5.0,2020 23 November,"
Love these flip flops. Very comfortable

Robin G.,5.0,2020 10 July,"
I love my Reef flip flops, super comfortable, perfect fit.  Highly recommend!
"
CAnne,5.0,2018 12 July,"
I love the way these fit and feel on my feet. I wore my last pair out from using everyday last summer so happy to see that Reef still sells this style. I love the “cushion” Reefs.
"
Brinda Griffin,5.0,2020 3 December,"
Super supportive. Fits snug

Have had a pair of these in the past and they lasted so long and have been so comfortable I was really glad that you were offering this product!
"
Teresa Patrick,5.0,2018 8 June,"
These are the most comfortable shoes ever. They do run very small. I wear a 8.5 to 9 normally but I ordered a 10 and they fit perfect. So order a size and a half larger.
"
Michelle Regnier,5.0,2019 14 September,"
These are so comfortable and have great arch support! I love the pink color and wear these every day! I will definitely buy another pair!
"
Tammy,5.0,2018 8 May,"
These are awesome! Price was incredible. Fit was perfect.  IMO, the only flip flops I have found that do not aggravate  plantar fasciitis.  Would love to find other colors at the same price.
"
frequent customer,3.0,2018 14 May,"
Love the look and feel of these flip flops but they are pretty snug where the strap connects in the arch.  Luckily the material is soft enough so it shouldn't chafe but I think I paid too much for them.
"
Jessie,5.0,2020 26 June,"
I have narrow feet and this sandal runs more true medium.
"
Justina McCafferty,3.0,2019 21 November,"
Love them, but definitely not true to size. I wear a 7.5-8. I ordered an 8 and they are way too small. 😪

"
Susan G,5.0,2017 15 December,"
Wear them daily. Will need a new pair by next summer, but that’s ok because one can never have too many flops. Love Reef. Out of the many brands I’ve tried, Reef is now my go to brand.
"
Nikki Bloom,5.0,2020 23 April,"
Very comfortable and very light.I wished they would come in white !
"
Melba,5.0,2020 7 July,"
They're a great product but they have good traction.
"
MommaJ,5.0,2018 8 August,"
These are my favorite, I bought two different Reef sandles, these are by far my fav. Light weight, flexible, yet durable. Love the braided top, very classy, nice with a dress
"
Alex Swann,1.0,2022 25 March,"
Ordered these shoes every summer for several years and this year the shoes was too narrow to wear comfortably. Returned, looking for a new brand of flip flops
"
Amber callicoatte,3.0,2020 31 May,"
Not for wide feet but are comfortable and cushioned
"
Michael Richards.,5.0,2020 16 July,"
Very nice sandals, will definitely buy another pair
"
Corie Isaacson,3.0,2017 17 September,"
Love the fit.  Love the design.  Love the cushion of the footbed.  But they are horribly slippery.  Zero traction on the bottom, and I've almost injured myself a few times on tile or small patches of wet surface.
"
Cinderkelly,5.0,2019 24 September,"
These are my absolute favorite. They look nice and fit perfectly. The braided too just looks better with wear in my opinion.
"
Camille Barrett,5.0,2020 8 May,"
Love! Super cute, comfortable and durable. Also has great arch support
"
Nicole ready,4.0,2017 24 March,"
This style is more narrow than my other Reef flips flops.  They are not my favorite, but they will work.
"
Jojo,2.0,2021 19 May,"
The flip flops squeeked until I wore them in and after they were worn in and then the black rubber started bleeding onto the bottoms of my feet.
"
Teresa S,5.0,2020 29 October,"
Love them
"
Kelly Davidson,3.0,2020 13 June,"

"
Mary L.,4.0,2018 17 May,"
Very comfortable!  My daughter has stolen them from me twice!
"
Stephanie Bergquist,5.0,2019 18 July,"
These are by far my favorite reefs ever.  I’ve been wearing them every day since I got them last week! Highly recommend them
"
Susan N,2.0,2020 15 July,"
I rated these a 2 because the bottoms are dangerously slick.  I purchased this brand because I spend a lot of time on wet docks and boats.  No way!  I almost slipped down in the grocery store the other day on dry floors.  Will not be wearing them again.
"
scooby,5.0,2020 24 July,"
So comfortable, Reefs are the best!
"
Megan Lynn Lyons,5.0,2018 8 May,"
Comfortable and very cute but they run small! I normally wear a size 7.5 and because they don't have it I got an 8. They're snug. When in doubt size up ladies!
"
Jewels,3.0,2017 9 October,"
It would get 5 stars EXCEPT that the sandals are narrow and dangerous to walk in as soon as they get wet. You will slide and fall if they get wet, but other than that they are really comfortable.
"
natava,5.0,2018 19 September,"
I pretty much live in these & am buying my 2nd pair now, since 1st purchase January 2018.  I just wanted and sort of needed a new pair.

Amazon Customer,5.0,2018 11 August,"
Runs small.  Originally purchased a size 8 for my daughter.  Returned those and got a size 9.  She usually wears a size 8.Very comfortable though!!!
"
Klarsen,3.0,2017 17 October,"
I did not like the width of the straps, wider than I like. Also the material of the straps after wearing only once got fuzzy and picked up (reminded me of a sweater like material).
"
Debra,2.0,2021 20 October,"

"
Lauri Moore,5.0,2019 30 July,"
Great flip flops! Super comfy and the coral color is perfect. As mentioned in other reviews, it is a bit narrow.
"
E. Johnson,2.0,2020 6 July,"
These flip flops are cute; however, they are more narrow than anticipated so the strap kinda hugs your foot.ALSO, the bottoms are SUPER flat so they are SLICK.  I've fallen while walking on wet grass while wearing these shoes due to the lack of traction.
"
Alisha,5.0,2020 15 July,"

"
K Rae,2.0,2020 30 July,"
These were tighter then I expected. I had tried on a pair of my sisters and they were so comfortable that I had to get myself some. I am trying to stretch them out a bit, but in the meantime, it’s not been pleasant:(
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 5 March,"

They run narrow but still an excellent product!
"
adaisy,5.0,2017 3 August,"
these reefs are so comfortable...soft and cushy...the only thing i'm not thrilled with is that the soles aren't as ""grippy"" as i would like a flip flop to be...otherwise, great flip flop from reef.

Kathie G.,5.0,2020 19 May,"
Super cute and comfortable.
"
Emily Bickham,1.0,2020 23 August,"
SO dissapointed 😭 I was so excited about these and they ended up WAY too small ... They say size 9 but I literally had multiple people double check to make sure it didn't read as size 6 because they were THAT much smaller for a 9. I think these are fakes because I've had a handful of reef flip flops and they've never been less than great quality and have always ran true to size. These were not only way too small, but they are flimsy and seem to be made cheaply
"
Amy,5.0,2019 22 July,"
These are super cute and comfy. They do run a whole size small, in my opinion.
"
Stackett,2.0,2020 5 August,"
I loved everything about this flip flop except for the fabric on the bottoms of the soles. It’s unfortunate because they’re very comfortable but I felt like I was going to slip when walking on any smooth surface.
"
Vickie Bobeda,5.0,2020 11 July,"
Very comfortable

"
DS2,1.0,2021 21 June,"
For a brand name like reef, the sole came apart of one of my sandals. Super unsafe to drive with cause when I would go to hit the break, the shoe and the sole would get caught. And then I wore to the lake one time and the toe ripped out so the were garbage.
"
Jeremy Russ,5.0,2020 29 June,"
Very comfortable
"
Kathleen MacKenzie,5.0,2018 23 June,"
Love these Reefs. I buy a new pair every summer, this style is incredibly comfortable and relatively supportive as far as flip flops go.
"
PowerHouse,1.0,2022 26 February,"

No black marks on your feet!  A little narrow, but stretch after a couple of uses. Good arch support and cushion.  Can't go wrong with reef flip flops.

"
Jennifer,5.0,2017 5 September,"
I love Reef flip-flops! Occasionally I come across a pair that's a little smaller fit, but these are perfect. I have flat feet so the arch support is great.
"
Kim dufresne,5.0,2019 28 March,"
I bought these for my daughter and she loves them.  Pricey but worth the money.
"
Valerina V.,5.0,2017 19 April,"
Just right as always. I can only wear shoes with arch support, which is especially hard to find in flip flops. A new pair of reefs is the best thing ever.
"

Heaven in a sandle! Love the color

Great for around the house. Wore out fast
"
Ellie R,5.0,2018 12 July,"
These are the MOST comfortable sandals I’ve ever owned! Soft and squishy like walking on a cloud with arch support too!!!!😍
"
Cherri T.,2.0,2017 24 April,"
I absolutely love Reef's and have been wearing them for many years! I'm a Florida girl, so flip-flops are a year- round shoe for me! I ordered a size 9 Medium, but the shoe feels really super narrow. The strap portion that secures into the sole near the arch area is located too far towards the center of the shoe. It's really uncomfortable you walk on - the straps actually rub underneath the arch of my foot.
"
jennifer,5.0,2019 29 September,"
These are perfect! They are absolutely the most comfortable flip flops ever!

Fit perfectly!
"
Brittany,1.0,2020 1 April,"
I purchased the first pair of these from a sporting goods store, where I had to buy 1 size up from what I normally wear (no big deal), and I’ve loved them. So I ordered this second pair thinking I was getting a deal since I paid $40 in store..... but I should’ve known better, I’m furious that I received a knockoff version when I was expecting the real thing. The pictures shown are real reefs but that’s definitely not what was shipped to me. Guess I learned my lesson.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2017 19 December,"
I love reefs, and like different colors. My daughter told me about them.  I have a few pair and will be getting more.
"
Laura Eagan,2.0,2020 6 May,"
These are not authentic Reefs. One foot's strap is tighter than the other. As I've worn them it has gotten better. For $20 they are cute and will serve the purpose but they are Knock Offs.
"
sherry fillweber,5.0,2019 7 June,"
I love the colors and the comfort of these particular flip flops.
"
Linda,5.0,2017 22 July,"
I haven't owned a pair of Reef thong sandals that I haven't liked.  They cushion, they support, and one has a multitude from which to choose.

"
Amazon Customer,2.0,2020 13 May,"
Comfortable to stand in. Tight getting the width of my foot in the shoe. Way to small in size. Gave to my daughter who wears a 7. Fits her perfect!
"
KEWB,5.0,2018 22 January,"
Reefs are my favorite flip flop. I love them and it shows because I wear them out each season
"
Lidocaine,2.0,2020 15 June,"
I’m very disappointed with the flip flops. They were a bit short and somehow slippery on surfaces. Too bad I realized this after I wore them outside!!!
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 13 July,"
These are wonderful! So cushiony and soft
"
KW21774,1.0,2021 4 May,"
Poor comfort, faulty design or production. The strap was inserted improperly causing a lump under your foot on one side. Tried to wear a couple times and caused me so much discomfort I had to stop wearing them.
"
J. A. Marchand,5.0,2019 5 September,"
But so expensive! Come on, Reef!

Timothy,1.0,2019 13 June,"
This was a legit purchase.  My children purchased these for my wife for mothers day since we were planning a trip to Mexico.  Living up North, we had not had weather to wear them, so first time was second week of June when we went on our trip.  Fell apart while walking in airport as shown in the picture.  Of course the return window had expired.  Last time we purchase sandals or similar on Amazon.
"
Puddin,5.0,2018 22 June,"
Bought two pair for my wife. She loves them. Can't go wrong with Reefs.
"
Beth S.,2.0,2020 5 June,"
The bottoms of the flip flops are too slippery for me. They don’t have good grip. I’m afraid of slipping on smooth surfaces wearing them.
"
Melissa Gorecki,2.0,2020 9 March,"
I typically love Reefs, but not these. The cloth/upper was made for a very narrow foot. I would have returned them, but they fit my sister. She finds them comfortable.
"
Kelley Dougherty,2.0,2020 12 June,"
The bottoms have zero grip. I almost fell on my hardwood floors. They’re actually slippery on the bottom, so be careful on certain surfaces.
"
Amazon Customer,3.0,2017 19 May,"
Shoes seem well made,  but run a bit small. I am returning them and ordering a size larger.
"

I wanted to replace my old Reefs flip flops. I ordered the same size. I was very disappointed to find that the new ones are a 1/2 inch narrower than the old ones. I returned them.
"
R. Reynolds,1.0,2020 22 June,"
Going back. So disappointed. They are soooo slippery on the bottom!  I tried them on and my first step I slipped on my wood floor. They are very tight on the band if you have wide feet forget it. They are also extremely light weight...do not feel like quality sandals. Sorry I hate giving bad reviews
"

Great reef flip flops
"
T. Hemminger,1.0,2020 9 July,"
I ordered a regular size 8 but fits like a 7 and are very narrow.  Straps are not lined up right.  They seem to be irregular compared to other shoes in this brand.  Reefs were made in Brazil but these say Vietnam.  Not sure if counterfeit or a bad run.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 17 July,"
Just what she wanted.

"
Curtin,5.0,2019 12 July,"

"
Mysbelle,1.0,2020 6 June,"
The arch on the right foot is off...slightly more forward than left foot. Had three friends outside family try on in case it was my feet. Very uncomfortable. Can’t wear. Also these shoes run small! I wear a 7.5 and ordered an 8 and they just fit.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2018 20 February,"
They are great !  Just what I was looking for!
"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2020 24 June,"
These are fake Reef flip flops.  I compared them to my sister's to be sure.  The print ""Reef"" is totally different font.  The sole is fake as well.  I can send pictures as well.  These people are running a total scam.
"
Elizabeth,5.0,2019 17 July,"
Love them
"
Angela Rathbun,5.0,2018 9 November,"
Not boat worthy. Very slippery sandals!!
"
Barbara G. Young,1.0,2019 2 April,"
The foot strap is much narrower than my other Reefs. It cut into my foot. I do have wide feet, but I haven't had this problem with other styles of Reefs. I was hoping for something a little less flip-floppy to wear on vacation. I was disappointed to have to return these.
"
Amazon Customer,5.0,2019 23 July,"
Perfect
"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2021 20 March,"
Why is there felt on the bottom? So dumb. It’s as if I’m skating on tile with felt on the bottom of these flip flops. Horrible!!!

"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2020 6 June,"
There is no traction on the bottom of these flip-flops. They are dangerously slippery. They’re also too tight and a little too short. I don’t know who is now making Reef flip-flops now, but they’re very poor quality. Highly disappointed
"
Ron,2.0,2020 22 July,"

"
Amazon Customer,1.0,2019 13 September,"
Worst fitting flip flops for the cost.  The braid strap is is too soft so your feet are all over the place.  Downsizing will not work because a 10 is an exact length for a women’s 10.  Fix the straps !!
"

Molly,1.0,2018 14 April,"
I usually wear a 6 1/2 but Reef are different Depending on style.  These I tried in 7. They were too small. My foot was hanging off. It seemed like an 8 would be too big. I am not too sure. I have never been an 8. Bottom line they run small!!!!!
"

Fabric stretched so I stopped wearing them because they feel to big after a week

After wearing these around for just an hour, the inside arches of my feet were killing me from these. Super uncomfortable on the arch of your foot and no tread...quite slippery on tile floors.
"
Katherine E Stewart,1.0,2020 21 May,"
Death traps!!! These flip flops are perfect in every way... they’re cute, comfortable, supportive! HOWEVER, the rubber sole is covered in a slick fabric, and they’re DANGEROUSLY slippery when walking on smooth surfaces.

I have another pair of reefs from several years ago and Loved them.  Not sure what happened but I had to go up a size and they're still not fitting comfortable.  Hate when companies change a good thing

These sandals broke with occasional wearing after three months.  They are not worth the price I paid for them.

A. Isaac,5.0,2022 21 May,"
I wear size 10 and ordered accordingly. They fit well. Very comfortable.  If I had the option of 10.5 I would definitely buy it.
"
lilteccas,4.0,2020 20 July,"
Ordered my standard shoe size 8. On my first day of Amazon wardrobe trial. First impressions these shoes are very small. They fit my foot exactly with NO room to spare. If I spread my toes I'm off the sides. I do like the thick cloth straps, feel like my feet are well held, rubber and plastic are the worst. Will get them wet later and see how they are.
"
GMH,3.0,2020 28 July,"
The soles of these are so slippery I have almost fallen so many timesTheyHave a arch support and for me that makes them uncomfortable to wear very longThey’ve a nice looking shoe
"
Sharon Crawford,3.0,2020 7 August,"
I order these flip flops all the time. They are the only ones I wear. These particular ones are so stretched out. Not happy with this particular pair
"
GadgetGal,3.0,2018 5 May,"
I always hope for a fit and support that the Reef Vision flip flops had. Yes, they were a men’s flip flop but they were the best I’d ever worn. I wore them everywhere, all day in Disney World and my feet were never sore or achey. Sadly they don’t make them anymore.These Cushion Threads really do run small, I normally wear 7.5 and prior (women’s) Reefs that I’ve had, size 8 was fine. These are borderline too small in an 8. They’re comfy but lack the kind of support and cushioning that the Visions have that I’m looking for. The straps are nice though, very soft and comfy.
"
Leah Parris,3.0,2019 1 October,"
Super comfortable but started fraying after wearing them a handful of times. Would be a great shoe if fabric was built better - but not worth $41 the way they are made now.
"
Ashley,5.0,2020 8 June,"
My Meem loved these. Of course the Reef brand is awesome anyway.
"
DM,5.0,2018 15 May,"
Good arch support and super comfy. No half sizes, I wear a 7 1/2 and the 8 fit perfectly.
"

"
Heather Jackson,1.0,2020 2 July,"
There is NO way these are a size 10. I usually wear 9.5-10 and these were way too short and tight. So disappointed.
"

LOVE these flip flops! Cushy, comfy and cute!
"
Krista,1.0,2020 16 July,"
Ordered a size larger usually wear a 9 ordered/received a 10 way to tight
"
S. Solberg,2.0,2018 12 February,"
I bought these several months ago. They are dangerously slippery. I finally ground down the soles to get some traction. I have hardwood floors. I have had other reef shoes w/o any problems of this nature. I wouldn't buy these again. Sadly I bought two pair.
"
Pamela E Michael,2.0,2018 18 September,"
I liked the style but they run very narrow.
"
Rodney Boyd,5.0,2019 21 September,"
The blue color is very nice.  Not a flat color but rather blend of blues, whites, etc.  Fits nicely and looks great with tropical type styles.
"
Casey,4.0,2020 3 July,"
They do seem a little more slim that most sandals. I usually wear a size 7 in most everything. These fit a little snug, but honestly I like them like that. They won't slide off and they have room to stretch as they wear. Very comfortable. The cons are they can be very slippery on certain surfaces and they cloth part wraps under the foot a little too much. I definitely walk on it. Overall great sandal. I will buy again.
"
Tammy Redmon,5.0,2020 30 January,"

"
James  Maddox,5.0,2020 7 June,"
I was very satisfied with my shopping. The shoes were really good, light and non-slip, and the slippers were of a nice light color, not as dark as in the picture. Size is normal and comfortable on the feet
"
Nancy Valdez,5.0,2020 18 August,"
exelente
"
Dawn,5.0,2020 16 November,"
These are great! I like the way that the tops of the flip flop are woven material and it is very comfortable on the top of the feet.  I was worried it would be too thick but it isn't at all.  The bottom is a bit hard but from wearing many flip flops i know that you have to wear them quite a bit to break them in and make them your favorite flips!
"
Rachel Henderson,5.0,2021 29 April,"
These are great sandals. So great that I wore the life out of the first pair and finally got myself a second pair! They are so incredibly comfortable and have decent support for this style of sandal.

"
KB,5.0,2020 14 June,"
I have several pairs of REEF flip-flops and these are my favorite ones! The cushion sole feels perfectly molded to the shape of my feet. The braided band is soft and wide so that they feel very supportive mid-step. Thank you REEF for making a excellent products!💜🙏

I have always loved Reefs but these are the most comfortable pair I’ve owned so far. Super cute and well made. I highly recommend. Arrived quickly as well
"
Nancy Pfarr,4.0,2022 6 February,"
Bought these for a tropical vacation.  I wear an 8 and sized up to 9, they are much more narrow than my other Reef flip flops, they fit just ok.  Not the most comfortable flip flops.  They were very, very hard to get on with wet feet.  Wouldn’t buy these again.
"

"
dporta,5.0,2021 7 March,"
I love Reefs and have been wearing them for years. I always get a new pair every year.  These are super cute.  Off white braiding and very cushiony, like walking on a cloud. My favorite flip flops!!
"
Sara F.,5.0,2022 4 June,"
These flip flops are the most comfortable I’ve ever owned. After years of wearing cheapo $3 flip flops, I wanted to invest in some better ones that offered more cushion and support. These did the trick! I walked around on vacation for several days in a row with no rubbing, blisters, aches, or pains.I’d recommend sizing up in these. I normally wear a size 8, but the 8s were too small. I exchanged for a size 9 and now they are perfect!
"
Marie,4.0,2022 1 July,"
Love the fit of these sandals/ flip flops. The arch support is great. So soft and cushiony. The only drawback is the soles are slippery. Ok as long as I’m on carpet or grass , but when walking on wood flooring  or tile I have slipped several times. Enough so that I don’t wear them in public.
"
B. Hanson,5.0,2022 30 May,"
Reef is the only flip flop I will wear due to their comfort and cute style. The cushion on this pair is amazing, the band is very soft and can wear these all day.
"

"
TRogers,5.0,2022 1 February,"
Absolutely love these. Super comfy. The straps are the best. They aren’t loose, middle piece doesn’t hurt and cushion is good. I wear between 9.5-10. Ordered 19 and works perfect. More than I would normally spend on flops but looking forward to wearing these.
"
lilmisssunshinesmommy,2.0,2022 24 June,"
These are super cute but oh my gosh they are tiny!! and I even sized up yet still couldn't even get it halfway on my foot. Sadly, I had to return them.
"
ForLoveofH2O,5.0,2022 11 September,"
Best flippies for people who want support!  They stay on your feet so well!
"
Tabitha,5.0,2022 5 April,"
I love these things! The cushion is great and they're so comfy. I will say that they didn't last me more than one year though. However, they're worth replacing.
"
Ryan,5.0,2022 15 January,"
Comfortable and fit true to size.
"
cathy b.,5.0,2022 11 July,"
For someone experiencing foot issues the flip flop allows you to go to church, the grocery, the beach, or walk a golden retriever in comfort even when you are 71 years old.😊 I ordered same one in brown.
"
Daniel A,3.0,2021 1 January,"
The product shipped on time and well. The durability seemed well built.. but.. as soon as I tried them on, I noticed they were pinching into the side of my feet because of the narrow design/construction. Where the strap meet the base its too narrow for me and there is a open gap that pinches my skin on the bottom of my foot. I gave these shoes 3 stars because of classic Reef durability. Returning item and ordered a different pair of Reefs.
"
Michelle Gagnon,2.0,2020 30 July,"
I expected these flip flops to be a lot better, the support is almost not there at all.  They are a decent flip flop but not worth the price I paid.  I expected them to be thicker with more support as arch support was indicated on the ad.
"
Lise from DDO,5.0,2020 5 August,"
Very confortable  I would like to have them in black
"
gulsah,5.0,2020 12 August,"
Very comfortable flip flops worth the cost. I went to an unplanned hike with them and I can say they are almost more comfortable than my running shoes.

Ulrike Helms,5.0,2022 25 July,"
Ein toller Flip Flop, der nicht nur schick aussieht, sondern durch dieses Cushion- Material auch noch super bequem und weich ist. Das Band zwischen den Zehen ist angenehm und die Riemen sind so breit, dass sie nicht einschneiden. Das tollste ist die biegsame Sohle mit Arch-Support - super weich und bequem und stützt den Fuß da, wo es nötig ist.

"
Abdullah’s’ Music,4.0,2021 25 February,"
Size 8. Comfy. The straps are like knit and feels good on my skin. However; summer is not here and that’s when I would really see if these flip flops are worth it.
"
Olivia,2.0,2021 16 June,"
These sandals were awesome when I first got them. The fit was great (I have a narrow foot), they are super comfy. However after a month of wear the foam has worn down to almost nothing and they are fraying at the toes. It looks like I have owned these for years rather than months.I would buy these for 20 dollars bit not a cent more. I'll stick with buying Roxy sandals.
"
Syed Hasan Masood,1.0,2020 27 December,"
When wearing, it is leaving severe black color on the toes. Not happy with the product at all.

Had to exchange for a larger size, usually wear 7 and had to get an 8, they fit great now. Really comfortable
"
Laura,3.0,2020 5 August,"
Order a size above your normal shoe size! I'm always a shoe size UK 5, however my heel was slipping off the back when I received these in a 5. They felt really comfy though and loved the look so exchanged  for the next size up. Shame as have been charged twice for the delivery now... Hope you're worth it Reef!

vbishouty,1.0,2022 7 August,"
Yes it has cushioning and yes it has arch support BUT EXTREMELY SLIPPERY on dry and wet surface.It’s even slippery on rough cement. Scared I’m going to slip and fall. Too bad it’s not grip like other reef flip flops. Sorry I do not recommend this. I’ve had many different reef flip flops, disappointed in this one.
